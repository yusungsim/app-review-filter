Giving, because, bug, It's a good game. Wish it had some more missions, but they can be very challenging, which is good and are well designed. Giving 4 stars because of a really really really annoying bug(?) Where it doesn't save what hero you were playing with last time you played so everytime it resets to the default guy and you have to go into the hero menu and reselect when you start the game again. Please fix this. It's not a problem in Kingdom Rush, so I'm not sure why it's a problem here.

payed, for, game, Great game, would have payed more for the complete game (heroes), but I'm not paying extra.
work, on, mobile, This is an excellent example of an RTS can work on mobile. Excellent.
grind, in, game, I like the game but why it is so hard to grind gold in this game please raise or put more gold when i am finishing a mission
want, in, RTS, Perfect if multiplayer. (Because it's so good though, still giving it 5 stars) It's basically all that you would want in a mobile RTS. It's as if Starcraft had been made into a mobile game from scratch!

ruined, for, me, It's worth 2.99, would of liked to see more unlockable heroes. That kinda ruined it for me. Nothing really to work towards your just completing levels to complete them, the game is fun to play. But not much life to it. You unlock your final hero about 15 mins into playing the game. Then all that's left is challenges and those are just check off boxes. You could keep playing to unlock everything in the skill tree. But once again that gets old pretty quick...Missed opportunity. IMO

looking, for, that, It felt as if I was back to playing StarCraft. This was not just a game but an experience that I had been looking for since I started gaming on android. Good work guys! Keep making more such games. üëç

enjoy, about, it, Great little game. Easily worth the couple bucks. Its definitely got a starcraft vibe, but i enjoy that about it. You have to pay for other heros but they do have sales on them and, sales aside, there all under 10$. No pay to win BS. Everything feels balanced but challenging. Would definitely recommend it FOR THE DEVS: is the ape Darwin a reference to the Nirvana song Very Ape? Just curious

pay, for, characters, Good little RTS, you still have to pay for additional characters so thats a bit of a bummer. The developers have a good sense of humor and you'll see some hilarious cameo appearances. Overall it was pretty fun.
locked, For, game, For a P2P game, it has locked heroes behind a paywall and progress is a lot taken after f2p games, including micro-transaction for boosts. Yes, you can complete without paying but the design feels like a f2p game with the intent of people buying microtransactions and heroes. It is a shame, had hopes to play a premium rts game, instead it has baked in the typical f2p money grabbers, it just ruins it.

TAKES, AFTER, STARCRAFT, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES AFTER STARCRAFT üòÅ so far it's a very fun little game that I can play anytime that I want to, the graphics are certainly good and they're hidden gems it seems on every level (like Jean-Luc Picard hiding in plain sight) I'm not going to give five stars because I only really just started playing... But so far it's a very good game with easy to learn controls and the combat looks good too.

work, on, phone, Very good game. Although it has some micro transactions, it's not pay to win. The RTS elements work well on a phone. And although I like their tower defence games, I like this way better.
switches, to, guy, Please fix the problem where the hero switches to the default marine guy when we enter the game
Stole, from, Starcraft, Great game. Stole stuff from Starcraft but it is still the coolest game I have played in ages on a phone. Great work Devs. Give me more.

enjoying, on, Android, Almost feel like in playing StarCraft I'm enjoying it so much on my Android
run, to, front, Really enjoying this game. A few quality of life changes. The commander resets everytime i close the game. Defults back to the first one which is annoying. Also, when you make your formation and then select all to move them, it would be awesome if the squads remembered their ordering/placement. I normally have snipers in the back but when i move all. Snipers run to the front because they think their rangers and its really annoying. Minor niggles otherwise one of my fav games!!
allow, before, purchase, It sucks that you don't allow a trial of your heros before purchase. Basically paid so much for a hero which is way weaker and vulnerable than free ones. What was even bshind this?! Even more ridiculous, one can't ask for a refund.

looks, like, Warhammer, Love the game. RTS is probably my favorite genre and this is a fantastic casual version. Doesn't hurt it looks sort of like Warhammer and Alien with some Starship Troopers vibe.
looking, for, rts, The mobile rts I've been looking for!
reach, for, discounts, Not really a pay to win, just need to grind a bit, like playing a mission twice to get faster tech points. No need to spent additional money except if you want the Premium Heroes, but you do not need one to finish the game. Saving tips : buy it once you reach world 3 for big discounts. Pros : + Fun RTS games on Tablet + Nicely drawn + Cheap full game Cons : - Not enough missions, it got 49 missions, but most mission is 15-30 mins each, so easily beat the game in 3 days. - Paid Premium Heroes

recommend, for, anyone, It's great, challenging, and a fantastic way of learning. I highly recommend this game for anyone into fictional games with strategy and lush graphics.

costs, for, all, A paid game requiring even more money for characters. This is really just a rip of free game with a LOT of in app purchases that you have to buy. So greedy like it costs ¬£50 for all of the heroes FIVE ZERO. FOR A MOBILE GAME never support this!
Reminds, of, wars, Lots of control issues... but what a blast I love it. Reminds me of brood wars
locked, behind, paywall, It's a great game but there needs to be a free way to earn more heroes. You only get 3 free ones and the rest are locked behind a paywall. I ended up buying them all myself for a little sale deal but it ended up costing me more than triple the initial game price. At the very least make the heroes cheaper. Only reason I spent so much on a mobile game was because I liked it so much. It doesn't matter if you can beat the game with the free heroes or not. We paid for the game and want the full game.

take, with, you, Throwback to some old games but with much more fluid graphics and gameplay. Fun story and a great game you can take with you anywhere. More games like this please.
Waiting, for, mode, Nice strategy. Waiting for multplayer mode.
keep, with, styles, Big fan of the games you guys make, for anyone who plays Kingdom Rush you'll enjoy the ingame graphics as they in keep with familiar art styles which are excellent! The game play is smooth and offers multiple options to create your own paths for upgrades. It's a shame you have to pay for better "heros" as the selection is quite limited. Over-all fun game, and would recommend the buy, purely on the basis of the concept and art style.

feels, in, hand, Very satisfying very This feels so good in the hand, ive just cleared lvl 1 I love the way this game looks, feels, and sounds Hands down top notch
Gotten, on, pass, Decent RTS, easy controls. Gotten on play pass, so don't know how bad IAP is, but without them it feels fun and a good way to pass the time.

play, since, Rush, I play this game ever since Kingdom Rush and so far the developers can't stop impressing me. New game, new gameplay. 200/10. Love the game.
waiting, on, anything, Very strategic gameplay super fun and a time killer if your waiting on anything
waiting, for, missions, Loved the game .. waiting for more missions
Had, since, start, Incredible experience but when are you guys releasing a new map or a new game for that matter. Had your entire series of game since the start but the updates takes kindda long. Love the game keep up the quality ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏èüôÇ
playing, for, days, Been playing for few days and it's been a very solid and fun game to play. There's plenty to keep one engaged. Lots of replay value on most boards because of many different heros and you may want a few at a high level. I'm happy for amount spent $. Worth it compared lots of games claiming there free yet need money to advance. Thanks to the devs. Keep making great premium games, I don't mind spending money for a great and complete game. Thanks

beat, on, difficulty, Incredible Game!!! The gameplay is incredibly fun! Its very unique and cheap! I see some people giving it bad reviews because some people think you need to buy heroes to beat the game which is not true at all. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty without spending a dime. THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN! (Which is incredibly rare these days) I can only highly recommend this game. Incredibly super super fun!

burning, after, years, Hey this game is still burning after years
locked, behind, paywall, Still 5* RTS style game imho, but I will admit, the lack of new content since I've installed the game does kind of suck. The fact the characters are locked behind a paywall, albeit I went ahead and bought them after I beat the entire thing, other than achievements. All missions are done and I'm progressing to do them on the hardest diff, and it's def possible if you know how how play an RTS, no need to pay-to-win. The only lackluster part is no new content or custom game mode, & locked chars.

come, to, game, This is a fun game which I would have to say is the closest I have come to a proper C&C game since EA pulled Red Alert from the store

locked, behind, paywall, Great Game, too much locked behind a paywall. There are 3 heros available with about 7 locked behind a paywall, with some costing as much as the game itself. To add to that frustration, every time you clear a stage you get a 'Hero Unlocked' notification, with no heros actually unlocking.

looking, for, that, This is the game that I've been looking for.. it's so fun
find, for, device, It's as good of an RTS as you'll find for a mobile device. Lots of different units and strategies to try. Lots of different types of missions. Definitely worth the money. Controls can be a bit tricky, but that might just be cause I'm older
played, on, mobile, More than worth the price. Most optimized rts I've played on mobile. Yes, there is an option to purchase additional heroes, but you will do more than fine with what's provided. I do plan on purchasing a few to show some love to the developers and get a little extra fun in the process.

charging, for, game, Unfortunately, despite charging a premium for this game, the developer also expects some players to spend possibly hundreds of dollars on in-game items. Not only does this needlessly cheapen gameplay, but it is arguably the least morally responsible path for a developer to take. This game is strongly reminiscent of Starcraft, so if that's your bag, and you don't mind the possibility of giving the developer many times over what this game is worth, then you might enjoy it.

managed, around, map, I do enjoy parts of this game, like it's art style and progression system, however my biggest gripe is with the controls. So far as I know there's no grouping for units and each unit has to be micro managed around the map. It becomes tedious fast. Grouping is an important feature of most RTS and for good reason.
selected, to, hero, Great except....everytime you loggout it switches you main hero selected to the first hero who useless lol üòÜ i only use rocketgirl shes fun üòÑ but great game i hope for more levels

balances, between, strategy, Absolutely great game. This game balances perfectly between real time strategy and tower defense. It's challenging enough, and exciting at the same time so I don't bother to grind the levels again and again to level up heroes. The graphic is good as others of the same studio. Thank the Ironhide Studio for another great game. Can't wait to try Junkworld.

pay, for, it, Great lil RTS, it's one my most played games. But buying new heroes kinda feels empty. Every new hero you buy should unlock more content like their origin story campaigns in their native homeworlds. Along with the comics to tell the lore. Please do not let this game die. Make more content. People are ready to pay for it.
buy, with, money, Wish there was other ways of unlocking heros other than having to buy them with real money other than that really fun game
keeps, on, toes, Worth the money very smooth and keeps you on your toes
move, on, field, I hope the developers will make the same functions on units who can move around on the field like those in Kingdom Rush series.

have, in, case, Pretty fun actually. High replay value. Only gripe is the lack of free heroes, and the cost of the others, but also kind of understandable with how much game there actually is in here. Just could be cheaper, or have the bundle option always available, just in case.
like, as, kid, Fun game. If you like command and conquer as a kid this is a great lil filler on an airline flight to play offline. Buy it
used, to, it, Really fun kind of hard sometimes but you get used to it
put, on, it, What a boring game. I do not recommend buying it. It's silly. Kingdom Rush is the only good game from these developers. But this game is a waste of time and money. If I could put 0 stars on it, I would.
needs, for, paid, Great game, needs more content especially for a paid for game.

play, for, hour, Was really excited for a mobile RTS but at the start you were really limited in what you could do. It was a very linear experience and I didn't want to play for more than an hour
completed, in, time, I haven't completed a game in a long time but this kept my interest. Got it on Game Pass so definitely worth it! I'm even requesting more content!

think, Over, all, Tons of levels and bonus challenge levels. Lots of heros but you have to buy a lot of them. Pretty sizable upgrade tree that's pretty fun to progress with. Over all I think it's definitely worth it.
expect, from, game, World 3 final stage...system hangs...don't expect this from a paid upfront game ...
go, like, RTS, Really fun. I wish it had more building reliance and allows us to play where buildings go like a true RTS. Also a save game feature. Its mobile and has even more likely you'll have to unexpectedly put the game down.
wait, for, chapter, Quite new type of gameplay for ironhide studios and yet manage to pull it off great, i will wait for the next chapter, i suggest adding daily missions where it refresh every so often and its levels are different everytime and even different on the campaign. "And for sake ironhide add the ENCYCLOPEDIA!"

challenging, at, times, I expected an RTS and that's what it is. Fun, challenging at times and a lot of aliens to kill!
play, in, üôÇ, Great game! Hope to play ironmarines 2 in the future üôÇ
responded, to, me, Really good, the devs are really nice too, i've had an issue with the payment and they responded to me extremely fast, definitely recommended
has, for, ways, Good strategy based game. Good graphics, fun to play, challenging and has a fun upgrade system for different ways of play.
known, for, greed, Good game, annoying pay again to unlock. Only 3 heros even after buying. Developer is known for this greed in past games so not a surprise but a big disappointment. Rating reflects this.

pay, for, game, Would give 5 but only giving us 3 heros out of 10 seems a bit unfair considering we pay for the game it's like after I get the ghost guy that's it which kinda sucked a little but other than that it's great I've almost 100% completed a normal difficulty
play, for, hours, Cool game. I enjoy games like this. I can play it for hours. Only thing I don't like is that they still use your info even though you have to pay for the game.

buy, for, money, Combat system is well designed as well as talent trees & extras, there's no real need to buy anything for money as long as you're willing to grind a bit, no errors so far. On the other hand, I would like to see more building types, levels, as well as units & hero's available in turn for progressing the game. Moreover, It would be great to see muliplayer modes as well as custom modes (perhaps something similar as in StarCraft) also being able to play as the robotic or swarm faction.

paid, for, hero, This is a phone game so you can't expect starcraft. I still had the vibe of starcraft and the graphics are great. I like how they have simplified this games format but made it feel immersive. You don't have to pay anything. I paid $8 extra for a hero I didn't have to I already beat the game with the three heroes they give you. Wanted to buy the hero because I had a good Time and I really appreciated that considering most of these games nowadays suck and want money consistently.

pay, for, game, You pay for a game that has built in micro transactions. Very lame and refund my money!

redo, with, difficulty, I love the game and I hope that there will be more campaign content in the next patch or so... This game is one of the best Strategy games I've ever played. It does need some other ways to control units. For Experienced strategists like me, the campaign is a little too short. The story however, is very Interesting. I'd like to redo the campaign with different difficulty but when I change it... It seems to be the completed one but harder... I'd like the devs to change this pls. 5 star review.
make, for, it, It's a really good game. Wish they would make more for it
pay, for, heros, Please do more planets! This app is great! While I acknowledge that you have to pay for more heros while in the game, you can definitely complete it without paying for anything more.

feel, to, this, Very nostalgic, almost warcraft feel to this ...not a tower defense like the rest of their games...full commander style makes for a much more expansive, and explorable environment...the buildable bases could use a few more options, and a bit more focus....I love TD, but I grew up with this stuff..........add a couple more planets and we can talk FIVE stars....

beaten, WITHOUT, purchases, Good, not great! Heroes WAY too expensive. Ironhide like most modern game companies are too greedy and we gamers are too weak and spend too much! Claimng a game is made to be beaten WITHOUT extra content purchases does NOT make up for the unnecersary greed of micro transactions in a PAID game. The prices of some of these "micro transactions" are not exactly "micro", and together they add up to the cost of a FULL AAA title. PURE & UNECESARY GREED!

got, to, hard, I bought this game because I liked the kindom rush games they made but this game is kinda OK. I gave this game a chance and I liked it but than it just got way to hard to play because all The enimes were way to strong and my guys were so weak and I was just on normal mode. This game just isn't for me but if you like this type of game than get it because Iron hide makes some of the best games for the Google play store.
spend, on, games, I've always been hesitant to spend money on phone games, but Iron Marines was well worth it! The increasing difficulty levels mixed with the engaging gameplay makes for hours of top quality fun!

payed, for, what, Great game. Not pay to play, you buy it and you get what you payed for. Great graphics and concept. No ads. Not sure if the pricey hereoes are necessary- so far it seems not at all. I recommend this to TD and RTS players.

had, with, Starcraft, I love their other tower defense games. This is a bit different though. Its like their old style had a baby with Starcraft. This will become very clear when playing. Its very enjoyable.
feels, like, choice, I'm enjoying it so far. The free heroes seem good enough to beat the game with. There are heroes you can buy, but it feels more like a choice than a necessity. So I'm happy about that.
paid, for, game, I paid for this game and the casual difficulty should be alright but is not, when you passed few words, is getting harder and you can't do something, is already casual difficulty, for what reason? Even says hero unlocked but is no one heroes unlocked, all costs money idk why it says heroes unlocked.
played, in, awhile, Pretty damn cool havent played cnc in awhile this is more like warcraft but well done anyway
having, with, game, I'm having a great time with this game. The hero units are unique.
rescue, to, point, The game is really cool because not only the fact that it has awesome levels but also special levels where you not only have to defender attack but also rescue someone to the safe point. Boss fights are amazing and I like how creative the levels are. I would really be happy if the developers add another world or make it a online game ü§óü§óü§ó
click, on, screen, Good game, only thing is I wish you could select a unit then click on the screen to move them the drag is cool but I like to group my guys together so I'll pick one but then drag to move it and end up selecting a different unit
have, on, game, Very fun, have it on a tablet, great game.
beat, after, upgrades, One of the nowadays rare strategy games which is both very good (try to beat everything on impossible after upgrades) and does not try to empty your wallet
are, in, transactions, Although there are in game transactions, you don't have to pay to win. Glad to see developers that are not money hungry and want to create a good game.
hidden, behind, paywalls, A repetitive yet enjoyable game. However, it is much more a tower defense than an RTS game. Also, the in-game monetisation scheme is abusive‚Äîway too much content is hidden behind paywalls.
hidden, in, game, More of a tower defense game than anything, hidden in a "build your army" game
switch, After, update, After latest update I can't switch heroes, I am stuck with the first guy, entering the heroes screen shows the first guy level 99 and can't do anything, must hard close the game...fix it!!

played, on, Ipad, fun game, played it on my Ipad, a bit sad you need to buy some of the agents, but if we go for game play, it's acctually very fun!

spent, on, games, 5 star game, countless hours spent on ironhide games. Only complaint is the hero costs, maybe a bundle to get them all for a cheaper price to solve that? but amazing game in literally every other aspect. The references to other scifi movies and such are hilarious just as a last note.

made, per, fun, Peash where do I start man it's made of per fun
know, of, today, Oh! I want to add: this game has one of the best, top-notch "level designs" in mobile games, as I know of today!
compared, to, games, Great addition to the Ironhide stable. Loved it all the way through... gameplay is quite different compared to their earlier TD games. Docked a star for no catalog of ally and enemy units.
pay, for, game, It is outrageous that I pay 5‚Ç¨ for a game only to find 11 out of 14 heroes locked behind a pay wall. The game itself is okay but feels really static and in my opinion it is not even worth the price, even if I had all the content accessible.

Reminds, of, Command, Reminds me of Good Ol' Command and Conquer. I miss RTS's, thank you Iron Hide.
play, for, a, have a base and both equal leveled heroes. Wpuld make people play for a
reminds, among, us, No crashes so far. Animation reminds me of among us. Killing aliens wave after wave feels good. Great gaming app experience.
clicking, on, location, This game has everything a classic tower defence game has and much more. Heroes with unique skills, different troops with different speciality, weakness and strength creating diverse play style. But there are suggestions I hav, like showing the hp of the shields when they are taking damage, making another option for relocating troops and heroes by selecting them and clicking on desired location, changing the appearance on the towers and refineries as they are upgraded. Adding skin for heroes.
Simplified, for, mobile, Simplified RTS for mobile, perfect for shot breake
put, in, way, It was a good concept put in the wrong way. This could have been repayable but this was made linearly
get, to, mobile, As close as we are going to get to StarCraft mobile. (and that's a compliment!)
pay, for, what, No add is what you pay for, has some fun to it. Will keep playing for now, but the pay to win features are killing the game for me.
has, to, it, No add is what you pay for, has some fun to it. Will keep playing for now, but the pay to win features are killing the game for me.
do, with, strategy, controls impossible to pick specific units and generally a messy combat. nothing to do with strategy. waste of money.
have, on, range, I didn't knew mobile games could be this high quality, the only thing I would add is a Stop command so units can stop walking and start attacking inmediatly if they have enemy units already on range.
Wish, for, content, Just great. Wish for more content please
understand, with, units, Reminiscent of the early Starcraft games. Easy to understand with new units and enemies having helpful popup descriptions. Definitely worth it!
worry, about, IAPs, Great with Play Pass and not having to worry about IAPs. Love the gameplay and enjoy the silliness. I hope there will be a sequel!
keep, for, opportunities, Full on Action packed, Plenty of fighting styles to choose from once you advance and it don't cost any money. Love this game, definitely a fun way to kill a few while idle. Hope y'all enjoy it.....BTW I've found a coupe glitches that have been beneficial to my advancement so keep an eye out for opportunities.
stuck, in, mission, üò≠ maybe it's me who doesn't understand how to do things but ai got stuck in mission 3 with no option to get more squads and overwhelmed by enemies.

want, in, type, Is what you want in this type of game but the in-app purchases is to much.
reminds, of, Starcraft, Pretty fun and addictive. Some levels are pretty challenging but definitely beatable without spending any money. Overall great game and reminds me of Starcraft a little bit. A good change of pace from their tower defense games, more of an RTS style of play.
hoping, for, command, Kind of fun at first but gets progressively worse. the third boss is just painfully annoying. Was hoping for a more command and conquer type game.
Thank, for, works, I enjoyed this game very much. Not much of a strategy buff, but this game is beginner-friendly. Though, as you gain more knowledge and experience, you will surely want to challenge yourself and increase the difficulties. In short, this game needs a sequel. I hope Iron Hide would considered this. Thank you very much for your hard works, commitment and dedication towards making a very enjoyable and fun games.
picking, for, job, Great time killer and makes picking the right unit for the job important
Reminds, of, Dawn, Great game for an Android phone. Reminds me of Dawn of war 2: retribution
continued, with, this, Only complaint is it's not longer. I'm glad they found commercial success with their TD games but I really wish they had continued with this... the market is flooded with TD.

introduces, at, pace, Best casual rts for phones. Uses simple, easy to understand mechanics and has a fair learning curve that introduces new units and mechanics at a good pace. The unit system gives 3 subclasses to each category of unit that can be changed out on the fly to fill different rolls as each mission goes on, giving the player opportunity to adapt to surprises even on the first try at a mission. This is a case study on how to build an rts from the ground up for a phone.

complete, at, mode, I have no idea what the point make the mode easy, normal and hard. Because the reward still same no extra reward like more drop rate for gold and exp for hard mode? Can complete the game at easy mode so fast then.what after if done all the story?That fist free hero looks so weak then his soldier, guess the sniper very strong can instantkill only just 1 shoot for target lock.Cheap game at outside but try open, its still need want money inside. I like the comic story, the arts looks so amazing.
reminds, of, art, Smooth, reminds me of Gonzo's art a lot. Tonnes of fun!
Love, about, it, Great game! Love everything about it
play, as, races, The game is very decent and has some good mechanics and interface. It is not pay to win either. For die hard rts fans the only disappointment maybe that you cannot play as other races and an absence of pvp and custom games.
lead, in, maps, A fun take on tower defense & real time strategy games. Quirky heroes (3 can be upgraded, rest are premium) lead the fight against aliens in 3 distinct world maps with lots of side missions to challenge your commander skills. Simple touch controls direct the action ingame. There are RPG style perma upgrades for your troops in battle you get just by playing. Unique comic book style presentation of the campaign is great with tons of pop-culture references. Good sound & soundtrack design.
comes, to, RTS, Pros: - This is as close as it comes to a mobile RTS. - Well made. - Decent storylines. Cons: - Doesnt take long to complete whole campaign on hardest differculty avaiable. - Not worth replaying on differculty unlocked by completing campaign, once you've maxed characters and tech tree it becomes easy and boring. - Most heros require ingame purchase and unreasonably priced. - The final boss is a joke. A requirement to beat him is luck. Needs: - PvP would make this a top-tier mobile RTS.

locked, behind, paywalls, Solid rts...but with almost all heroes locked behind paywalls
caring, about, game, Was at 5 star but now 3 mainly because Ironside stopped caring about this game
boring, after, that, It's awesome, but could you add more levels, after you complete the whole game it's sort of boring after that.
s, to, butt, I m giving 4 star full stregty game idea aowsem graphic aowsem everything it,s to good butt only 3 maps please add more apps and challenges and hero lvl up only 10 i m waiting for new improvement

found, of, transactions, Pretty entertaining, although I'm not found of micro transactions in a paid game
become, with, story, This is a great game ! So much potential to become greater with a story and experience upgrade ü§òüèæ
play, with, difficulty, You basically have to play with casual difficulty almost the whole game in order to get enough upgrades and do enough damage to tackle Normal, Veteran and then Impossible The game also tells you that new heroes have been unlocked after certain missions, but the only way to use them is to buy them with real money, the game it's OK for the initial price tag, but shelling out 20‚Ç¨ for the heroes is too much... Better off buying a copy of StarCraft with the Expansion and get the Carbot theme

buy, with, currency, Please add: 1. Encyclopedia 2. Option to buy heroes with game currency. Great game overall
required, on, difficulties, The game is great, missions provides good variety and it is fun. Unfortunately there are lot of downsides as well: 1. Heroes are expensive 2. Microtransactions - I suspect either real money or grinding will be required on higher difficulties 3. No encyclopedia or in game information (like hp, armor, abilities) about your units or enemies 4. Achievements are not sorted and it is difficult to track what achievements are obtainable in current mission. 5. Tech tree - can only be completely reset.
bring, to, game, Great RTS game. Managed to bring important RTS elements to a mobile game and keep it simple. Unit mix, micro, hero, upgrades, scouting,... I really like the transformation feature of units to add more depth to the game, while keeping the number of units small.

Waiting, for, Marines, Waiting for Iron Marines 2 lool
win, in, experience, The game is hard but you can still win,and so far in my own experience, it's fun to play and of course I'm an old fan of kingdom rush, can't wait to get the achievements
find, within, levels, Excellent. Typical Ironside; clean design of epic playable heros/soldier units (animation and sound), Easter eggs to find within levels, smooth game play. Beat game within a few days and worth every moment. Becoming a real fan of this studio. Probably the best cellphone games available.
win, in, end, So far, the game is excellent. Very challenging and entertaining. It is difficult to find good strategy games these days which aren't pay to win in the end.
kept, for, games, I love how Ironhide has kept their same theme for all their games but just put a fun twist on them. This game is no different. Only reason it's not 5 stars is cause there is only one save file. Not sure why they removed that feature.

looking, for, challenge, I'm playing it at normal, was looking for a nice challenge and to experience the game at its normal state. I'm enjoying thus far, just did my 3rd mission now. Long way to go, looking forward to it. I hope there is a pvp or multi-player on this, would love to chose between aliens and humans, and do pvp RTS battles like Art of War 3 or Red Alert pvp game plays.

win, of, game, One of the best strategy games that I have ever played, it's awesome, it's not pay to win kind of game, I spent only 120‚Çπ and I was able to clear entire game. You need to be good with strategy though. All those people who are ranting about this game being pay to win should seriously questions their abilities first. Overall great gaming experience, it's non addective and fun. Loved it

waste, on, games, Premium game. Do not waste time on mediocre games that are unbalanced unless you pay. This game is awesome and buying extra heroes is not necessary.
playing, for, times, Big fan of the series and this one is even stunningly better. The game is gradually difficult but after playing over again for many times you'll figure out the best strategy to win. In my opinion the game is balanced and well designed with great attentions to graphics and sounds, plus the little ingame achievements. I paid two discount packages of two heroes and really enjoyed the characters. Great job.

The game is gradually difficult but after playing over again for many times you'll figure out the best strategy to win. In my opinion the game is balanced and well designed with great attentions to graphics and sounds, plus the little ingame achievements.

paying, for, game, Microtransactions after paying for the game... Not cool.
were, like, one, One of my favorite games! Wish there were more like this one
buying, for, money, Very good game some of the bosses are challenging but its winnable without buying stuff for real money
move, on, that, The studios made an amazing game. The different story and the fakt that you can move your troops on the whole map is very amazing. The design of the game is very intresting and I would like to know who has the idea for the look of the enimies. Of cause the insiders exist. Sometimes the handling of the troops is difficult, but in case of the loveable story, I gave this game 5 stars.

locked, behind, wall, Things I dont like is control & heroes locked behind the pay wall.Overall, the game is not too bad, but not too good either.
run, at, 60fps, You guys update this game pretty regularly and thats very good, but i dont know why the game doesn't run at 60fps on my device. Please optimize the game so that it can run at 60fps. Please do this, it will be my dream game.

bought, because, games, I bought this game because of the Kingdom Rush games. At first I didn't think I would like it because it is very different than the Kingdom Rush games. It's also really hard for me to find games that I want to play. But I love it! And I like the fact that it's a bit different. Tons of fun.
got, on, sale, I got this on sale and really enjoyed it. The difficulty is really great, and there is no need to buy the extra items. Some of the extra levels are really difficult which is fun.
come, with, review, Definitely worth money, I'm having so much fun until now. I'll come back with another review soon. Update: I'm still enjoying this game so far. However, this game is dead. Developer seems only care about bugs and there are no more big update such as characters, maps, and stories.

put, into, game, I'm really enjoying this game, I like the art style the game runs smoothly and isn't like trash fake mobile games they put a lot of work into this game and it's really good!
hope, in, guys, Nice and simple... I wish it had a skirmish option... And hope in the future u guys can put more planet to conquer...
complete, in, couple, Good game can complete in a couple of days!!, Should be allowed to skip cut scenes especially when retry multiple times difficult or tough stages
paid, for, app, Good game, however the in-app purchases is absolutely disgusting. I already paid for this app, why do I have to pay more? Horrible business strategy, makes me want to refund.
keep, from, star, Good RTS, some pay to win elements that keep this from 5 star
Ironhide, for, life, Ironhide for life yo
put, into, it, Worth every penny. Very intricate and a lot of effort has been put into it.
paying, for, game, Great game. Strategies really matters. It is just sad you need to buy the remaining heroes after paying for the game.
annihilate, into, hits, It's a great game just at the end mission it's very hard and it's annoying cuz you don't basically what I'm saying is the creature in the last mission and annihilate everything annihilate turrets into hits that's kind of annoying in the Marines they don't do anything to them

pay, for, dollars, I pay for almost 10 dollars but i really enjoy the game. simple and nice as i have nothing to do during my work hours. Just a look out in the bridge (Seafarer).

won, without, any, Great RTS. Graphics and UI are good. A excellent challenge and can be won without any in game purchases. You can also adjust the difficulty if needed and it wasn't. You can unlock the 1st three heros and still have a very enjoyable experience. Long time gamer so I'm hard to impress. So many other games out there require ingame purchases to win, this is not one if them unless you want to clear it in a day and then what's the point. No bugs either in my experience. Keep up the awesome dev!

hit, in, way, I've been waiting years for something like starcraft or Warcraft to hit mobiles in an effective way to play. Bingo has been called! üññüññüññüññüññ My only suggestion would be the choice to have an alternate skin for more of a fantasy feel for those who prefer it.
give, In, update, Need improvement in controls like defecated buttons for individual and all troop selection please give it In next update.
playing, for, time, Great game but needs more levels. Ive been playing iron hide for a long time. Iron Marines 2? üòÅüëçüëçüëç
payed, for, pack, I payed for a pack with my Gpay, but I didnot recieve the pack, anyone help ???
seems, on, side, Fun and original for all ages... I only deducted the one star point because the control system seems a little bit on the clunky and difficult side of things.
combines, in, form, It is a basic yet fun little RTS that combines basic base building in the form of capture points with tower defense elements and spawn able units, as well as heroes you can call to the field during missions. I don't want to say much more as to not spoil anything, so check out this well made game and have fun playing a legitimately fun mobile RTS, it is worth at least one full playthrough.

continues, until, you, There is a bug that makes it so that your hero automatically damages things when playing Spec Op White Fangs. This continues until you minus out the game, even if you start another level. It's like she's using a fire raad explosion on the enemies, but without the graphics. This does not detract enough from the game to make it three stars though. Also, you have an encyclopedia in your other games, why not this one.
paid, for, heroes, It's my latest favorite game. Just enough story with hilarious elements added. I gladly paid for all the heroes, just to have the fun characters to explore. Great worlds. Well done!
Add, in, planet, Great game..great characters and missions..just wish it was longer! Add in another planet and it's a 5*!
take, on, fit, Amazing take on the rts genre fit for mobile
played, on, pc, Nice game played on pc and also on mobile. everything is great in this game. Also it is totally f2p dont worry about just buy game and play.
put, from, story, IronHide just makes quality games. I really apreciate the effort they put from the story to the graphics and gameplay. You will not regret they money you spent.

rolled, into, excellent, a little rts and a little of craft all rolled into one excellent
build, as, profile, Not what I thought I don't enjoy the game and I don't like the fact that you can't build up your own base like in command and conquer as your profile of the game states useless game and I want a refund.
comes, with, characters, No! Absolutey not! I paid MONEY for this game and it only comes with 3 characters? And there's no in-game way to unlock the other ones you have to pay MORE money for them? It's games like this that give the mobile gaming industry a bad name. The style looked cool but I didn't even get to the gameplay. Don't act like you're a "premium" game and then lock content behind additional microtransactions, that's the most garbage behavior and completely unforgivable. The devs should be ashamed.

got, on, sale, Fantastic game. Im only upset that I didn't buy it sooner. I got it on sale for 99 cents but I would have gladly paid the 2.99, hell id pay 9.99 for something like this. Its all around just a fun and fair RTS. There are a seemingly limitless number of tower defense games to choose from but ive not come across very many legit RTS games on mobile so its a nice surprise, ive always loved TD, RTS, and strategy games in general since I was little so this game so far has been a very pleasant surprise.

spoiled, with, saves, Nice & fun, but fun spoiled with no checkpoint saves or in game saving. I hope developers wpuld implement ingames saving.
unlock, in, missions, It good game If only I could unlock other heroes in missions
level, within, game, Huge confidence trick. There appear to be 2 versions of this game. 1. Purchased & with in game purchases 2. Available via Google Play Pass with no upfront cost & no in game purchases possible. I've been playing the 2nd version. Previously able to get to level 7 within the game before hit a brick wall thats impossible to get pass even on casual play (the lowest). And because there are no in game purchase, that appears to be it - a very short game indeed. 4/5* reviews make no sense to me.

Reminds, of, Starcraft, Reminds me of old school Starcraft
developed, in, format, Awesome my only wish is that this game gets developed in 3d format like pubg u and similar to zombie Survival it would be more than ever awesome but the developer won't listen üòÇ.
Looking, for, Craft, Looking for Star Craft for an Android phones? U have it - Iron Marines! Just give it a try. But do not rush Urselves in emotions before U complete 1 act (first planet). After the first act U'll love the game! I'm sure 'bout that! Recommended! 4 out of 5 stars ('cause some bugs). P.s. But I see U still fixing them *bugs

eat, at, life, It's a really fun game! The style of this company fits this type of game so perfectly. My only real complaint is that it seems to eat away at my battery life. I played one level. I started at 90% and finished at 76%

having, at, end, Anyone having trouble with the Tyrant at the end of the first world? I can't even get half of his health down without him destroying all my bases. I have tried like 8 times and all the same results.
enjoyed, for, hours, Fun game that can be enjoyed for hours!

build, in, way, I live the game. Gameplay, Graphics, storyline, difficulty all very well programmed. Suggestions to developer, Please invent a game like age of empires or clash of clans. You can build it in much more sensible way than what is currently available on playstore and with the graphics like this. People will go crazy on that game.

woven, through, missions, This is probably the ultimate defense game! Superb UI. Love the "story" woven through the missions in each world. The three free heroes do the task well, but I'm hoping that there would be the option to purchase the other heroes by credits. Nonetheless, this is worth purchasing for. üôÇ

pay, for, rest, It's a paid game, WITH microtransaction. You get a couple of heroes, but have to pay $50 for the rest.
Ironside, at, 5ype, Very good TD game. Ironside 3xcells at this 5ype of game.
suffers, from, problem, A pretty good mobile strategy game with loads of upgrades but it suffers from the same problem as other Ironhide games, unbalanced bosses at the end of some levels which force you to use a specific strategy. It's very frustrating having to replay a level repeatedly just to try a new strategy on the end boss. A simple checkpoint system or more information on the upcoming boss would solve this.

waiting, for, one, One of the must interesting game I've ever playd. I am waiting for a similar one with kingdom rush heroes
see, in, future, Awesome game hope to see others like this in the future!
fight, for, inch, Buy the plane, win the game. This is some of my favorite space sci-fi since starship troopers and starcraft. With the exception of a few overtuned bosses (the tyrant) the game's difficulty is very entertaining. You'll fight hard for every inch and it's a wonderful little world. I wish there was more content. Maybe some choke point survival.
played, on, mobile, Its one of the best rts ive played on a mobile
reminds, of, warhammer, Its a very intense gameplay..... A must play tower defense & strategy game hybrid..this game reminds me of warhammer
do, in, games, so far enjoying it a lot. my only criticism would be to allow to zoom in closer to make it easier to select characters. or maybe a pause option like they do in some turn based games. but then i guess it takes away from the "rush"... mmmmh...
stalling, with, mode, I love how dr. Graff is a walking medical station, I also love stalling power with the support mode
riddled, with, microtransactions, Thoroughly dissapointed, costs a chunk of money and is then riddled with microtransactions. It is linear hiding behind the visade of being open. Not worth the money, this is why games should have demo so we can try before we buy. Defo regret buying this

playing, for, week, Dear friends/developers, I have been playing this game for about a week now, but I have not finished it yet. My one and only disappointment was when I noticed there is no Iron Marines 2, 3,... Please, if you ever read this I think you will notice that the review speaks for itself. Thank you for this cool, fun and entertaining game and for the time and hard work spent to develop it. Craving for more .üòÅ

finished, in, week, Great graphics and the different objectives keep it interesting. Only four stars because it needs more levels. I finished the game in a week vs 3-4 weeks for other Ironhide Games.

spend, on, game, GREAT game. Fun and has lots of strategy with the different units and upgrades. I would recommend having EVENTS so players can earn new heroes and power ups without having to spend more money on a game that they have already paid to play. All around great game though.
reminds, of, warcraft, Pretty amusing lil game reminds me of old-school warcraft
deal, on, time, Really enjoying this game!! ALOT! Good thing I bought the all heroes deal on time!!
go, with, games, can't go wrong with Armor games
were, on, mobile, I love this game. Played it probably twice over. I really wish there were more RTS games like this on mobile.
parodying, like, fantasy, It's not a bad game, in the same vein as the others but instead of parodying tropes like fantasy and pirates iron marines seems to have simply used the entirety of StarCraft for most of its inspiration. There is also a bigger sin here where 3/4 of the heroes are behind a paywall. I already paid for your game. I refuse to pay 2-3x more for different ways to describe "move here and attack."

gain, with, research, Good relaxing game that doesn't involve too much thinking. I like that even when you lose you still gain a little ground with research, etc so basically it gets a little easier each try.
killing, on, go, Nice little rts for killing timr on the go. Sure polished and fully fleshed out.
spent, on, game, I have spent $7 toatal on this game and the gameplay is amazing. However i will not tolerate being LIED TO! UPDATE: ------------------------- I accused them of lying for the tech tree perk "research treaty" not functioning as described but once i made it to the second world i woukd receive tech points even when completing old mission.. however sense research treaty states "10% more tech points upon completing ANY mission" but not on the first world, for old missions.

pay, for, game, cash graber. you already pay for the game and still they want you to buy thoese heroes in game
buy, in, game, cash graber. you already pay for the game and still they want you to buy thoese heroes in game
spend, for, sort, If this had a skirmish mode with a few maps. I would spend more money for that sort of dlc
ended, on, lol, as a RTS lover, i was pleasently surprised at how well this game works, another success from ironhide, that being said, i hope yall add more stuff or maybe a sequel since yall ended on a cliffhanger lol. GOOD GAME Would be interesting to have PvP.
do, with, balance, I like it a lot not to easy and not to hard unless you do the elite stuff perfect and fun with good balance on all things
lies, like, response, Tired of pay to play, pay to win games. What does paying prove but stupidity? Ironhide LIES, this games is DESIGNED to suck cash. Pay to play, pay to win, they spew lies like their response: this game designed to be completed without buying extras? LIARS.
pumping, in, money, Very bad. Dishonest, greedy, thieving. Blatant pay to play, pay to "win". Strangely I don't feel any sense of accomplishment from pumping in money to be told I win. No room for skill, strategy, nothing but pay. Uninstalling.
play, on, platform, Great fun, just complicated enough to keep you playing, but not so complicated it becomes too hard to play on a mobile platform. I don't understand all the comments about micro transactions and "greed." Currently working through on the hardest difficulty and have not spent more money than the initial price of like $3. They give you access to 3 heros with the initial purchase. You can by 10 or so more for $15, not sure what the problem is. Stop whining, developing games isn't cheap!

reminded, of, game, I really love this game. It reminded me of a game called Halo Wars. I wish the creators would added Multiplayer mode and endless mode, but other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Please add different type of modes such as Multiplayer (Co-Op and Versus mode) and Endless mode (Team and Solo). Whenever you do add these type of gamemodes please make sure it can be played with local wifi and other people around the world also. I'll give it a full perfect 5 star ratings either ways tho thxss

gets, on, casual, Great game! Keep up the good work Ironhide Games! P.S gets difficult quick even on casual if your'e new to any RTS like i am
make, like, vengence, Best game ever and pls add more levels and heroes aswel make like kingdom rush vengence in iron marines you can play the opposite side
grabbed, through, Pass, Read my entire post, gamers. I grabbed this through Play Pass, and it removes the need to buy the extra heroes... However, this is not a justification or reason for you to subscribe to Play Pass. This is a premium app, and you should get everything when you pay for it. Google should force that. You wouldn't buy a car without its motor, so why buy a game without all its content? Great game, too much greed. 1 star. Let's review bomb developers who do this. Google: Implement some quality control.

Enjoyed, as, way, Enjoyed this game as a way to kill time. Definitely worth the few bucks. Yeah some of the extra heros cost a bit, but you don't need them to play or enjoy the game. Would recommend.
mix, in, themes, Kingdom rush but the heroes are the focus and the towers are a backdrop. Also mix in some obvious starcraft themes.
describe, like, rush, First of all I describe that game just like kingdom rush 1 but it never bored I just finished the game within two days

satisfying, for, mobile, An efficient and insanely satisfying Starcraft for mobile. Great tactical challenges without the mouse clicking, and modifying your unit make-up on the fly is very fun while maintaining each level's unique difficulty. All the greatest elements of Blizz/Starcraft for 3 bucks.

left, from, mishion, like the red alert games by west wood but this is like that but in space and need more levels and storys and things to research along with the ability to use left over cristals from a mishion to research stuff and make settlement ments on sigon-1 and well i was woundering if there will be a jungle planet + desert and forests planteds

takes, around, level, the first few levels are kinda fun but around the fourth level it takes a sharp increase in the amount of enemies spawning making it impossible not to get swarmed instantly, no matter what I do I can't seem to get past it.

start, with, references, I don't know where to start Let's start with the references I noticed starcraft, Star Trek,fallout and many more Very cool storyline with many enemies, challenges and upgrades.
dealing, with, units, I'm a little concerned about the depth of this game along with the ease of use in dealing with multiple units. Having said that, this could be (FINALLY) the C&C heir apparent for mobile! There is a lot to love about this game, I even love the music. I normally turn off music & sfx 1st thing in games but not this one. There's too much to mention about what I like & even more about suggestions but TRY IT if you like RTS! Love to see multiple unit groups & unit specific commands like guard & such!

balanced, with, tactics, I played full game and completed all campaigns. And i truly enjoyed playing the game all balanced with tactics and challenges.. People who want to try some rts, and base building, defending, offense kind of game then make sure try this one. I want more campaigning missions future. Thanks deves giving such a great experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è Good work üëç
made, for, devices, An awesome RTS made for mobile devices!
makes, for, that, I prefer a more sandbox style RTS where you can build wherever you'd like but this game makes up for that by being a solid RTS on a mobile device. Kudos to ironhide for never disappointing and trying their hand at what seems to be a dead but great genre.
do, with, lines, I think this is a good game could do with more mission and story lines
Playing, from, start, Great game! Playing it over again from the start. When are you creating iron marines part 2?
crush, at, times, I need more of this! This game is insanely awesome! It's not very simple and will crush you at times and cause you to regroup and reassess. The only reason why I took a star off is because you must pay for other heroes. I've already paid for the game, why not have additional challenges to collect points to use to unlock other characters? It would make the game more challenging and longer lasting.

reminds, of, craft, Pretty fun, reminds me of star craft.
bought, in, content, The gameplay is nice and smooth but i had bought in game content but i received none. I lost my money ,like the payment was done, i got the transaction id too but i did not get my content . I sent two mails till now..none of them got a response. So im giving the rating as one star.

leans, in, direction, Not many RTS games on mobile. This one is pretty decent in context. To use RTS terminology, it leans much more in the direction of micro than macro. Lot of fun to be had, but unfortunately most learning comes from trial & error. Enjoyable, well differentiated characters. Rapid switching of unit types is an interesting, new mechanic. Compelling skill-tree. Beginning of the game is rough on hardest difficulty, and the last third of the game is a bit of a slog.

engaged, into, levels, Had me very much engaged into the levels, color & strategy among infantry options, Takes about 4 levels to get going though.
contribute, to, line, when will be the next big update of this game? looking forward for creating new worlds like where the heroes came from and what will they contribute to the main story line. and if also there's a new units and upgrades to release Best of luckü§ü
