is, twiddler, made, it, If you have played any game by this developer before you will know what to expect. It may not be fancy but it is a well made, relaxing, thumb twiddler of a game.
is, experience, charming, This, This is a charming laid back experience. Easy to get in to, and easy to loose track of time while playing.

's, game, good, it, Really addicting. Just managing all your little heroes and the town customization is crazy... Only reason I rate it a 4 star and not a 5 is because I just wish it was a bit more challenging. maybe more battle types or something but I feel like there's something missing... Regardless it's a really good game. üëç
's, game, cute, It, It's a cute game, but the ingame notifications get annoying
's, game, great, it, Great game, really deep, loads to do. There are a lot of 'hey, you did a thing!' pop ups that have to be clicked on multiple times and it can get slightly annoying, but it's still a great game and totally warrants 5 stars
is, improvement, complete, this, really enjoyed the original and this is a complete improvement. glad to see kariosoft getting back to the one time purchases.
is, game, awesome, This, This is an awesome game. I played the original and this adds lots of fun things. It's very replayable and worth the price.
'm, spender, compulsive, I, Way more content than I expected, super fun, been playing it for days straight and really enjoying it. I appreciate there being no ads or microtransactions as I'm a compulsive spender. I'm definitely going to buy kairosoft games in the future since I can trust their quality games (and to avoid temptations of microtransactions in their f2p games :) )
's, game, best, it, Charming enough... Okay, okay, it's the best Kairosoft game I've played in a while.

is, game, great, this, So this is a great game i believe, and seems fun, but if you do not have a lot of patience for resetting then this may not be for you, running out of money can get frustrating, maybe im doing something wrong. But if you dont like conserving your money just right, or the strategy and luck involved, and if you dont mind resetting back a few in-game years of progress occasionally, its a great game.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. Can be a bit repetitive but I still recommend it.
is, game, fun, it, exactly what yoh think it is super fun little management rpg game

is, game, normal, This, This is a very normal game. Something that I thought was extinct. Worth every dime and penny.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game that you can sink lots of time into. You pay once then never again. No in game adds, no microtransactions. They are a bit heavy on ai notifs but it is worth it.
's, game, deep, it, One of the best Kairosoft games. I was skeptical that a sequel to Dungeon Village could be better, because I loved the original, but this blows the first game out of the water. I can't stop playing it. Totally worth the buy-in; no microtransactions and it's an insanely deep and long-lived game.
was, game, free, it, I have played the first one ages ago when it was a free game (I believe I am not 100% on that)
is, improvement, big, this, I loved Dungeon Village 1 and this is a big improvement over it. One of their better games in recent years for sure. Easy 5 stars.
's, game, casual, It, Kairosoft does it again! It's a casual game, but requires strategy. I can play it for hours!
's, game, good, It, It's a good game worth the money easy to pick up for just a little bit or to get caught up in for a few hours. 9/10 for a phone game.
's, game, worth, It, It's a good game worth the money easy to pick up for just a little bit or to get caught up in for a few hours. 9/10 for a phone game.
is, sequel, great, this, Loved dungeon village and this is a great sequel. Fun to play but interrupted a bit too much by pop up messages. Still definitely worth playing though.
's, annoys, kind, it, The game itself is really good, I could give 5, but there is to many achievements notification it's kind annoys and makes me a bit tired when playing. I wish you make another dungeon village sequel with less notification like this one. Overall this is a great game

is, design, bad, this, Nice game, happy to see a sequel to Dungeon Village, but first boss is impossible to beat first time. If intentional, this is bad game design, as there is no telegraphing of this and you get punished for not being able to beat him. If not, this is still bad game design as he is too hard to defeat in any reasonable way, being able to wipe you even if you send literally everything you have.

's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. No microtransactions or ads in it. Easy to pick up town builder that seems to have a lot of depth.
is, thing, only, which, Very charming and fun town management/rpg game. The popups do get a bit annoying at times which is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars... Worth a buy, solid game!
is, thing, good, which, Excellent little town builder rpg. Lots of things to keep you busy. Takes some strategy to keep your towns gold balance where it should be, which is a good thing. I wish more mobile games operated like this.
is, sink, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic little time sink, we'll worth the price of admission. Haven't noticed any bugs or issues in the game at all.
's, game, entertaining, It, It's a fairly entertaining game to keep you occupied but it would be nice if you could skip the pop ups for when the quests appear and whatnot since the game pauses
're, fan, big, you, Amazing time killer, if you're a big fan of simulation games, I highly recommend this one. Kairosoft has been a long time favorite of mine...from Game Dev to Oh! Edo, this revisit to Dungeon Village is no disappointment! 5 stars, hands down.
is, upgrade, huge, This, After quite some time of not keeping myself up to date on kairosoft games i still bought this without hesitation. 1. Because kairosoft. 2. Dungeon village part 2! This is such a huge upgrade from the first one. Tons of gameplay! It has different maps to explore while still keeping your progress. Jobs facilities adventurers still remain while there's new ones unlock on the next map. Overall it's another good one from kairosoft. Now I'm hoping to see Ninja Village 2!

's, sink, total, it, Beware: it's a total time sink.
is, game, fun, This, This is a fun, interactive game to play when you get some downtime. It pauses when you leave the game so you always start off where you left things. I love how you can customize your town and the people living in it!

's, improvement, huge, It, Really fun game You manage a town and train adventurers who fight monsters It has pretty decent depth, tons of features, items, buildings, characters, jobs, etc. It's a huge improvement on the first game.
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game to pass the time with!
's, sink, cute, It, It's a cute, fun little time sink.

was, game, first, it, Played the 1st game many many years ago and it was my first kairosoft game. This one also meets my expectations and was very enjoyable to play. 5/5
be, game, best, this, The achievement pop ups are redundant. Without those this would be the best kairosoft game made, not including Beastie Bay. Please, please, please! Make Beastie Bay 2. Much love, and wishes of success and honor... An American.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun time sync game. It's worth the 7 bucks I paid.
is, game, good, This, This is a good game, but it needs tweaking to be a great mobile game. Less popups, improved GUI etc. However it is fun and enjoyable, in fact it was to quick to beat. The popups are too much need to be handled better. I would like to see a PC port, with longer game play; like stardew Valley and a longer more casual version for mobile. Game is designed well and has good mechanics, perfect for fun, just do not expect to put your phone down.
's, set, interesting, It, I've had fun with it. It's an interesting set up, different from most games out there, but still easy to figure out.

is, game, fantastic, This, Freaking addictive. This is a fantastic game with tons of heart. Don't be put off by the price -- it's worth more, trust me.
is, pairing, winning, this, As always, this is a winning pairing or casual and tycoon game that still keeps you involved for hours on end.
's, upgrade, solid, It, It's a solid upgrade from dungeon village 1, however once you get to around a 4 star village you can't even look away from your phone without a pop-up pausing your game to tell you something mundane, really frustrating after awhile.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game
'm, fan, huge, I, I cannot explain how much fun I had with this game. I'm a huge Kairosoft fan in general, but this one blew me away. Great work!
's, concept, simple, it, just finished my first town with 5stars there for this review is for 5stars. like all there games it's a simple concept and they expand on it further slow and steady love it üëèüòä
is, way, fun, This, This is a fun way to spend your time. Try it!
's, fun, good, it, Great game. A bit short like other Kairosoft games, but it's good fun, winnable, and has a lot of replayability.
been, fan, huge, I, I've always been a huge fan of Ksoft games. I loved dungeon village 1 and really like Dv2 thanks for a good game at a rationale price
's, way, great, It, I have had a blast with this game! I didn't expect it to have the level of depth that it does. It's a great way to unwind after work.
's, game, same, It, It's the same game! $7 for a 2 at the end of the title. Loved the first one but I don't see how it's different from the first.
