is, thing, sad, which, I've given every Kingdom Rush game 5 stars so far. What happened? This is coming from someone who's beaten the other gamers on the hardest difficulty. I have a strange feeling that the difficulty was cranked to encourage spending on micro transactions, which is a really sad thing to see. This isn't the fun kind of difficult. It feels like every tower has been nerfed, maps are balanced poorly, and enemies are badly thought out. Save your cash and buy the previous entries. They're far better.

's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game. I'm a big fan of Iron Hide games. However, this one is a bit buggy. I've had multiple levels that would progress after the final wave. It is a game breaking bug. Would by 5 stars otherwise

is, rush, best, this, I feel this is the best kingdom rush because of the tower loadout.
's, Rush, good, It, It's not the good (g)old Kingdom Rush
was, game, standalone, this, Level design, animation and gameplay are all great as per the previous Kingdom Rush games. If this was a standalone game I'd probably be rating it 5. But the new tower setup really bothers me. At first it seems fun to be able to pick before each level, but you soon realise that adding this gameplay element takes away level strategy too much. Start with the wrong tower set and you'll fail no matter what.
's, stingy, little, it, Lil disappointed that I cant earn all towers without paying for them, for a not free game it's a little stingy
are, design, great, they, I love the game so much. I bought everything (tower,hero) and they are all great and well design.BUT there is one thing that make the game boring is that when you finish all the level it's getting boring like i know you cannot to every day content but at least make like you know a survival level like the other.One like it's endless wave and it show all the enemy and it's getting harder and harder but like I said the game in design is perfect!

's, game, great, It, It's a great tower defence game. Doesn't feel like you get stuck and you can always progress really fun game.
's, deal, big, that, really good game nothing wrong with it except how short it was but that's not a big deal I still like messing around
's, pressure, likely, it, I've been playing Kingdom Rush games since I was a child. The strategy, graphics, amount of content, and level of polish have only increased with each game, this one probably being the best so far. The reason I only give 4/5 stars though is because of the predatory monitization methods used in a PAID game. I know it's most likely corporate pressure that cause these changes and not the developers themselves. No hate. It doesn't matter if the game is still balanced, it's just a shame.

am, fan, massive, I, I am a massive fan of the Kingdom rush series and have played all of the previous 3 games. However this just falls short. The character designs are nowhere near as fluent and sleek as the earlier games. I understand that these are the "bad guys" and are meant to look demonic or evil, but even evil characters can be pretty cool looking. I only played the first couple of levels and then got bored. Please bring back the orginal design and aesthetics.

is, game, solid, It, It is a solid game worth to receive 5 stars, however due to the fact that this premium gam has microtransactions for heroes, I can't give it more then 4.

is, game, best, This, This is definitely the best game from Ironhide tower defense series. Got tons of fun playing it.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but now the best
are, dev, small, they, I have been playing Kingdom Rush games since day one. I even was a Kickstarter for their board game. After paying 5 dollars for the latest game to see thst there was easily another 30-60$ of additional content to purchase really has left a sour taste in my mouth. I understand they are a "small dev" and I've given nothing but support to them over the years... just kind of sucks that this wasn't a free game considering the amount of dlc OR more content included in the 5$ price tag

is, version, worst, This, This is the worst version of KR ive played. It now charges for the inital game AND heroes AND towers! The animations aren't as good as previous installments. You cant sell towers for their full price during inital level setup. Theres a long list of small things that make this game bad. Play the other KR games instead if you haven't.
'm, adopter, early, I, Purchased the game but a lot of locked content hidden behind a pay wall. I'm an early adopter and have purchased all previous games before they were for free. In past versions, you had access to more champions and the full spectrum of towers. Unfortunately, the feeling I'm getting is that they delivered the least amount for the most they can get away with. Really disappointed with this one. Also, looking at other reviews, many of people are saying the same thing - listen to your consumer base!
's, game, great, It, It's great game except for the price of heroes and tower is too expensive.
was, find, awesome, That, Love the variety of towers! And also love 'The thing Reference!' That was an awesome find! Great movie.
's, design, bad, It, Too difficult. 5 minute placing towers and 20 minute-long mission only to miss some sneaky guy at the end ignore defenders and run by? And have to start all the way from beginning? It's bad game design, it's just frustrating and not fun. Maybe checkpoints of something would fix that, but right now I gave up on level 4 after restarting it like 15 times.
was, franchise, good, it, too many microtransactions. it was a good franchise while it lasted
is, game, great, This, Stylish fun and things are well priced. This is a great game
's, challenge, nice, it, I love this game so much honestly one of my top 10 it's a nice challenge I honestly the other ones were fairly easy I only have one complaint and it's not a very big one it's that there's only one file

's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game, good to play whenever you want. I have been playing it for years and always come back to playing. 5 stars easy.

's, game, shorter, it, Fun game that you expect from Kingdom Rush but why is the Encyclopedia of enemies and towers not included in the mobile version? Feels like a weird thing to omit.. Updated to 4 stars. Why not 5? Missing encyclopedia and it's a shorter game from the other Kingdom Rush games..
is, wierd, little, it, Very good game. Ironhide did a supreme job making this, the ability to swap out the type of towers at you disposal keeps the game intersting and fun all the way through. The art is absolutly wonderful, bight and new, while also not betraying that classic kingdom rush style. I will, however, say it is a little wierd to be playing as the BBEG from the first game
's, change, good, it, Very good game with lots of fun to be had, and you grt to play as the bad guys in this one so it's a good change from the last kr games
's, game, great, It, It's a great game that requires strategy and planning.

is, addition, good, it, i enjoy the idea of having different towers that you can equip and unequip into the loadout. it brings alot more variety to this game in comparison to previous kingdom rush games. although it is a good addition i dont think these certain towers should be available for purchase. i would much rather have additional challenges or achievement rewards give the extra towers so you dont have to pay for extra towers to use and just leave the heroes purchasable instead.
is, game, great, This, This is a great defense game. No ads and there are upgrades. The game is a slow paced time waster. Besides a speed button, I would LOVE to know how many kills a tower has. But other than that, another great game from ironhide.
's, game, best, it, Amazing game, they fixed the audio problem a lot of people had. 100% recommend this game as it's the best tower defense game.
being, dps, good, them, After thinking about it, 3 stars is to harsh. The game is great, just the weakest of the kingdom rush games imo. I feel like the tower variety suffered a lot due to the limited selection during a game and general balancing. After unlocking the bone throwers and mausoleum, I found myself not using anything else due to them being both good dps and great blocking towers. I definitely preferred to older style where each tower has a set of very distinct upgrade paths.
is, one, favorite, this, I've bought every Kindom Rush game and this is my favorite one. When i first got this game it seemed a little weird because It was a little slow but then I got used to it and now I love it. They replaced using your stars to buy stuff to getting souls and you can upgrade a bunch of things. And sadly they removed the feature to use the book to look what types of enimes there are. But other than that you should definitely buy this game. Super fun.
is, game, best, This, I love all Ironhide games. Especially the Kingdom Rush series. This is the best game on my phone for sure. Best studio ever! Thank you so much!
is, graphics, fantastic, this, Like all kingdom rush games, this is fantastic, great graphics, features etc. I wish that you still had the encyclopedia, that really helped with strategizing and it was also fun to collect all the enemies as you went along. I do miss being able to use the stars for upgrades, I feel that there is less motivation to move through the levels. Any glitches/bugs I've had in the game have been fixed with Ironhide getting onto the problem quickly. 4.5 stars🤩

am, fans, big, I, I am a big fans of Kingdom Rush series and this game is absolutely my favourite in the KR franchise. The game was smooth and lot of improvement especially in towers and heroes. The only downside for this game is the price for towers and heroes to costly, if you can inflate the price it would be much better.
is, one, best, This, This is the best one in my opinion mainly because you get the most tower variety. It is a little short though. And the lack of an endless mode or something keeps it from 5 stars.
been, fan, big, I, So good. I've been a big fan since the first one came out online. Just worked my way through the previous 3 games which is a must due to the storyline. All of their games are good but they've outdone themselves with this one 👍🏻
is, version, fun, It, It is a pretty fun version of the Kingdom Rush series, definitely worth the money spent.
is, version, worth, It, It is a pretty fun version of the Kingdom Rush series, definitely worth the money spent.
is, game, fantastic, it, Game struggles to open sometimes and a vast majority of the towers and heros you need to pay for (in a game you already had to pay for), aside from that it is a fantastic game and brings a fresh feel to the game series.
'm, fan, big, I, I'm a big fan of the series and hope they never stop producing new content. It would be cool for this game and maybe a future one to have continued dlc! I already spend a few bucks here there!
is, game, great, This, This is just a great game
is, game, best, This, This is the best tower defence game out there. Countless hours of entertainment
am, time, so, I, I really like it, I just don't like that you usually only have one hero, and that it costs extra money to get the better heroes and towers. I am waiting for the switch version where it is all paid for at once for a lower cost. On the upside, the customization of which towers to use is new and pretty cool. I am still only on level 5 though so time will tell if the earlier towers become too weak to do much and you have to only select the later ones. So far, I really like it. The story is fun.
's, series, fav, it, This game is like Dark Souls! Not the fun DS experience but a frustrating one. I played all KR games, because it's my fav series, and I will admit that I can't beat any of them on hard mode but the normal dificulty on this is just as punishing. What the heck? Tone down the difficulty a bit, I repeat, Normal mode is too hard.
's, experience, premium, it, Favorite game series on Android. Would pay more upfront to have everything unlockable within the game. But it's still a premium experience in a sea of garbage.
's, one, best, it, I love Kingdom Rush games I specially love this one it's the best one to date
's, experience, best, It, The Kingdom Rush series are the best tower defense games on the market. It's hands down the best experience out there for phones. No adds. Great challenge for experienced players and easy to play for beginners. Good graphics, many levels to beat and various towers to build. Well worth it. You can buy extra towers and heroes in the game but it is not needed to beat the game.
'm, fan, big, I, I loved this game so much! The genius writing and story making has left me speechless! You feel compelled to root for the heros you know and love but you also want to root for Vez'nan. The only thing that kept this from five stars is that for the most expensive game in the series you don't get acess to all the towers, and I'm not a big fan of the new tower mechanic. They also got rid of the encyclopedia and endless levels. But other than those two things this game is beautiful and worth the buy!
's, formula, same, it, So Vengeance is definitely different from the rest of the series. You no longer get stars for doing iron and elite stages. The upgrade system has been redone. The towers are different, by not giving you a second option of the final upgrade. Instead you choose up to 5 towers to bring into the stage with you and there's good variety for it. Other than those major changes, it's the same formula with playing as vez' nan. I still love the series and am glad they're trying new things
's, addition, fine, It, It's a fine addition to the franchise. However, the lack of an encyclopedia is disappointing. Also having to buy not only the heroes, but the towers too, sucks.
was, beacuse, hard, it, Simple easy control but hard if you play on veteran. Edit ever since the update the game get's easy every time with new hero before the hero and tower update it was hard beacuse you can't just spam tower now you can with in game bought tower though there are some lvl that are good.
is, difficulty, good, -Game, Pros: -Game is good difficulty is right. -Game has a lot of towers. Cons: -No speedup button. -No priority target to focus on specific enemy. -Too much heroes to buy with real money. -Buy potions with gems but gems are rare... -Some minor info about each enemy or tower is not dispalyed for example attacks per second or dodge rate
is, game, good, It, I've played all of the kingdom rush games, and this one is the best. Graphics are great, gameplay is awesome, and I love how you can have a loadout of different types of towers each round. This game has inspired me to draw and maybe make a video game like this one day. It is a very good game not many things that you have to purchase in the game. In my opinion the kingdom rushes go in this order, kingdom rush vengeance, kingdom rush the original, kingdom rush origins, kingdom rush frontiers.

been, fan, big, I, I have been a big big fan of the series since 2013. I really love kingdom rush vengeance specially for the graphics and newly designed interface. The difference can be seen between the previous versions of this game. Thanks for releasing this part as well. I hope to see another one very soon.

is, one, best, this, I have played kindom rush since the first flash game came out and this is the best one by far
's, game, fun, It, It's a little tough to figure the tower evolutions out but the earily game progresses well. It's a fun game that remains challenging and entertaining.
is, game, great, it, I've only played a couple games but it is a great game so far and brings some memories from the original game which I love
is, game, solid, This, This is a very solid TD game. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics are really nice. There are paid towers and heroes which are cool but they're optional, I can finish the game without them.
is, game, payed, this, It's really good, but annoying how you have to pay for most of the hero's and towers with real money when this is a payed game anyways.
's, pay, free, It, This game was made impossible to beat so you are forced to get the in-app purchases. It sucks because I payed 5.99 for this game and it should be playable. Reply: The whole game from start to finish. Impossible to play. It's a free pay to win game that you deceivingly charged 5.99 for. Shame!!!!
is, money, worst, This, Compared to the other games. This is by far the worst Too much money they ask for
is, money, much, This, Compared to the other games. This is by far the worst Too much money they ask for
been, games, separate, this, Super lame that you pay for this game to have to pay more for some of the towers and heros. Why can't this be a pay once and done game? So many towers to choose from, seems like this could have been two separate games. Update: it is true you do not need to pay for any of the extra towers or heros to play the game. It's just annoying to know they are there but if you want to use them, you have to pay a high price for it.
are, elements, essential, that, Meh, micro transactions are too steep for the lack lustre gameplay. Don't download until it is free to download, because it is still loaded with in-app purchases that are pretty essential gameplay elements.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game and a perfect sequel to the first three games. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the overly-priced microtransactions in the game. Still really fun though.
is, game, best, This, This is the best Kingdom Rush game.
is, game, great, this, I finished the entire game without paying any more money don't listen to the reviews this is a great and easy game it's not like other free apps or games that are a waste of time
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice Kingdom Rush game, but I'm not sure why they decided not to include an encyclopedia this time. Once you read the tip for an enemy once, it's gone forever. Also, the game will glitch if you do the bonus stages in the "wrong" order (though it doesn't tell you what the order is). I expected more from the highest priced game in the series.
