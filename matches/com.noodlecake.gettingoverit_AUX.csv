's, challenge, new, it, Just as frustrating as with mouse. Still have yet to find out what's at the top. 10/10 P.S. if you're expecting the same thing as the PC then you're wrong. If you're used to the mouse then you'll be frustrated by the touch controls but you just have to understand that it's a new challenge, just like switching from keyboard to controller on PC.
is, times, multiple, their, I came to figure out this game is setup their is no actual winning this game their is multiple times i would not touch the screen an id fall for a random reaso
is, game, awesome, it, Great experience and hard as nails, though I think even for the point of the game being to be hard, the rock next the red metal platform is ridiculously slippery compared to the other rocks, making it a more unrealistically forced annoyance, but beside that it really is an awesome game.
is, game, perfect, this, Horrible controls, annoying obstacles and painful quotes that make you want to rip your head off. That is why I love it. Terribly hard and horribly frustrating, this is the perfect game to make you want to murder someone.
is, game, great, It, It is a great game the consent is fun but the controls are really stupid like il be using the Hamer and then it will go from up to down without me even touching it
is, game, fun, It, It really is a fun game, but you really need to put on a control options.
is, game, bad, it, I dont need to explain why is it a bad game but its still a goodgame
's, lesson, valuable, It, Terrible. Awful. I hate it. Which is why I rated 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Right from the start, the game tells you, you might beat it, you might not. It doesn't give you a false sense of security, it literally tells you, don't get your hopes up: No amount of forward progress is guaranteed. It tells you the game will make you mad and it encourages you to take breaks if you get too frustrated. This game is so much more than a rage game. It's a valuable life lesson.
is, game, bad, it, It isn't worth the price to be hinest it has good quality but the controlls suck for a mobile player over all it is just a bad game i am not trying to be rude
's, game, unique, It, It's a very unique game. Took me over a year to finally beat, and after that it was smooth sailing. This game can occupy a lot of time, and can be very fun to many people.
was, sailing, smooth, it, It's a very unique game. Took me over a year to finally beat, and after that it was smooth sailing. This game can occupy a lot of time, and can be very fun to many people.
's, game, good, it, The controls are horrible and it's not that easy, I wish the person who made the game will make it alot better please, it's a good game but you are going to rage no matter what.
're, developer, bad, you, I wanted to give this game a try again on mobile, and regretted it almost immediately, and now can't get a refund for it. The game is good on pc and I've beat it around 100 times, but porting it to mobile is an obvious cash grab. The game doesn't work on mobile, it's impossible to play like you can on pc. Bennett, I hope you personally read this and understand how greedy this is, and that you're a bad developer for it.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game. It pisses me off.
's, game, nice, It, It's a very nice game but it's very fustrating
's, game, mobile, it, Is this game worth $5? Nope. My biggest complaint is that the controls are terrible. Granted it's a mobile game so you shouldn't expect much anyway, but it's extremely frustrating to get past certain parts only to get launched in the opposite direction because the controls are either unresponsive or over sensitive. The only plus side is that this game is free with the play pass so you don't have to waste your money to try it out if you have that.
's, game, fun, it, it's a really fun 15-minute game :) the mobile port really took a revolutionizing and unique take on mobile game controls, thank you noodlecake and bennett ;D very epicly epic :)()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()
be, game, good, they, This game is pretty addictive. There are poor reviews for functionality and responsiveness, and where they may be right, its still a good game. There are issues with the hammer not moving while mid-air to catch yourself, it just feels like it was made that way. If you go into the game expecting a challenge, let me tell you its well worth it. The creator made this game difficult and those reviews who complain about certain aspects are just complaints. There are ways to overcome the bugs. ðŸ’¯
's, Game, hard, it, This game requires intense concentration, a steady mind, and a calm person it's a very hard Game
is, game, worst, this, Worst game ever game ko banane wala director Pagal Hai pata nahin game kyon banae main bhi pahle Baat khelta tha lekin main Paar na hone ki vajah Se Gussa Karke Galiyan Nahin Di main game delete kar de do teen Baar aur ki thi lekin vah bhi delete kar d isliye this is the worst game ever on Play Store
's, sickle, big, that, Yeah that's a big fat nope sickle!
's, challenge, good, it, Honestly this game is a challenge but it's a good challenge you just have to try and have patience
is, game, fun, it, getting over it is a fun rage game. it can be challenging at first but once you beat it once or twice its pretty easy. c:
's, game, stressful, It, It's a stressful game but fun.
Is, thing, annoying, this, Is this the most annoying thing ever but it's still funny when you fall is just grunts ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘¿
's, game, good, it, If you've ever wanted a unique series of cramps in your hands and fingers, this game is for you. You know it's a good game when it makes you mad but also makes you wanna keep playing. It's a quality game for the price, and translates quite nicely to mobile. Pro-tip: mess around with the sensitivity and input acceleration to better suit your gameplay experience. It won't make the game easy, but it will make it easier. Also, PHYSICS.
was, game, fun, It, It was a fun game a little stressful but fun game

's, game, decent, it, The game itself is pretty interesting but if your not the patient and gentle kind, then I wouldn't really recommend this game to you. Overall it's a decent game with a simple purpose . (That is to obviously get over the mountain.) 3 starsl because I suck at it.
is, game, great, this, Hard game, this is a great game... Controls tho
's, game, great, it, it's a great game and I'm just not good at things like this, but I have 2 complaints. it flings me at the speed of light with one wrong swipe and I cant control the hammer sometimes. other than that it's really good and I recommend it.
's, way, only, it, This is a frustratingly difficult at times game when using a mouse and keyboard. Touch controls could cause you to need blood pressure medication. I only gave it a 3* because the game itself is good. Just don't play it on mobile unless it's your only way or you're a massochist.
is, port, interesting, This, This is an interesting port. The controls arent the best, especially compared to the pc version, but isn't that good? You aren't playing getting over it to have fun, you're playing it to suffer. The bad controls add to it. Your at the mercy of a shoddily controlled hammer. It makes you suffer more than the pc version, which is the games main goal.

is, game, good, It, It is a good game but not 5 stars because the controls are not very responsive
's, GAME, HARD, It, Okay, so the thing is, I've beaten this game twice now. Once on PC, and once on the Iphone 7. It's a HARD GAME, so understandable a lot of people leave bad reviews saying "oh the controls suck" and like, its really just them wanting to place blame on something. But since I have beaten it twice on two different platforms, I can honestly say, the android control are really BAD. Great game! Hard game, and I'm still gonna try and beat it. But, why does the iPhone have better controls? Lol
is, problem, personal, This, Good but my fingertips burn and cant figure out a way to have them stop. This is more a personal problem but its from this game
'm, person, angry, I, This game is so frustratingly fun. I'm a very angry person and this game surprisingly calms me down. I literally can play this game for HOURS. My only complaint is that the controls are touchy and that can be rather annoying.
's, game, frustrating, it, This game is just something else. You know it's a frustrating game when your hand gets cramps.
is, mother, try, It, It is a MUST try, painstakingly painful, excruciating difficult, notoriously repetitive, meticulously unforgiving, unforgettably memorable, delightfully satisfying, brilliantly crafted, unmistakable unique, completely addictive, mother f'ing of a game!!! Can't wait for a new map or v2. You said it is "designed to hurt a particular type of person" ... I love you and hate you at the same time! Well done ... Just well done!

is, game, enraging, This, Heed my words, my friends. This is the most frustrating, the most infuriating, the most enraging game I have ever played. I have seen many a Youtuber freak out, scream, & even hurl chairs at the wall over this. On mobile, it's much more difficult. But no matter who you are, this will plague you.
is, game, great, this, I think this is a great game but if you prefer mouse and keyboard I get it but if you want the ultimate challenge play on phone
was, goot, pretty, it, ANGER AAAAASHHHHHHVXSSB IM MAD OOOOOOOHHHHHH IM NOT HAPPY ARG OOF FUDGE IM GOING TO RIP OUT MY SCROTUM AND SHUVE IT IN THAT DAM POT also it was pretty goot
is, game, painful, This, This is a truly painful game to play. It is truly horrific. I love it.
's, game, horrible, It, How can you make a game so frustrating but so addicting. It's a horrible game but an awesome game. Be ready for anger and try not to spike your device.
is, game, easy, it, it is very easy game I complete this in 1:23 minute
is, form, only, this, Listen to me. Mr creator. I'm going to find you and make sure this is your only form of transport for the rest of your life. This game is like a bad relationship. Keeps hurting me but I keep returning. But also love it
'm, fan, massive, I, Don't waste your time, I'm a massive fan of the game on pc and have completed it many times But even on the lowest graphics settings this game from 2 years ago still barely runs on a brand new flagship phone. If you own a hypothetical future phone that can run it the experience is much the same as the real version and could probably pass the time pretty well
's, game, good, it, As much as it's hard, and unpredictable, it's a good game
'm, critic, harsh, I, It's confusing and challenging yet gets a bit zen, I don't want to say too much, that could effect user experience but it has introduced me to the concept of b-games and I'm now quite curious to explore more. I'm also a harsh critic when it comes to ratings and this is close to being a 5 star game based on concept, but the initial frustration with understanding would not let me give 5 stars even though that is part of the game experience. This game made me think.
's, game, fun, it, Passes the time. It has a weird spin that kinda starts you all over, but thats to be expected with beta testing. At least it makes it more challenging, which gives you a feeling of accomplishment whenever you pass something. I haven't finished it yet, but it's a fun game, and I'm determined to complete it.
is, game, hard, This, This is a hard game but you have to keep going and practice, I hated the game before, but then I realized that not being able to do it was my fault, so for 3 days I kept playing and on the third day today, I beat it and it was super rewarding.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game
