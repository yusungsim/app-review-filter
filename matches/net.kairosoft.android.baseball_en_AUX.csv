was, inning, 9th, It, I won the summer tournament 9 - 8. It was the 9th inning with the other team on third base 2 outs, 2 strikes, and 3 balls. Thought the enemy batter would get a homerun to win the game but my pitcher Bob Man came in clutch and struck him out. 10/10 would get a heart attack again.
's, game, great, it, Love this Game however I have noticed that in the tournaments when it says who you are playing next and 2ho you play next don't always show the same opponent. Other then that it's a great game
is, replayability, favorite, this, Out of all of kairosoft this is by far my favorite so much fun great replayability and it just gets better and better

's, game, good, It, +:It's a good Kairosoft game. If you like most of their older games, you'll like this one too. -:The amount of tapping needed to move through the dialog is a bit much. And the amout of time between two matches is way to short. So you'll have to hurry with everything you do if you have a tournament running+friendlies.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game,very adictive and love the graphics of Kairosoft

was, bucks, best, it, Never purchased a app on the app store and I can already tell it was the best 5 bucks I've spent
'm, fan, big, I, Triple A, for amazing and amusing. Great mechanics and direction. Love the half simulated and half arcade feel. Appealing graphics. What more can a long time fan ask for? A new game. I'm a big fan of basketball. I'd love it was made by Kariosoft.
be, problem, moderate, This, Overall it's fun, but there's a severe imbalance when it comes to facing teams that are about on par with you or slightly better. I would expect to lose more often than not, but usually you just get slaughtered. This would only be a moderate problem if you didn't need to beat those better teams to get most of the better players.   Never being the home team needs to be fixed. Baseball is the only sport where the home team has a significant rules advantage, and you never get it in this game.   Training players requires too many points. It also requires way too much investment to get to the top levels of your school stats. In game power-ups rarely seem to be worth it. I hate the game's decision making when it comes to bunting, because I never want to bunt. The game is very inconsistent when identifying clutch moments.
'm, fan, huge, I, I've been a fan of Kairosoft for years, and I'm also a huge baseball fan. Needless to say, this one hit the sweet spot. Bit of a learning curve, with some surprising depth. All in all, Kairosoft hit a home run with this solid mid-season pickup.
is, game, fun, It, It is a very fun game, but you should make a second one where you make a MLB team or you go from High school to the MLB as a coach or manager, that would be pretty cool
is, game, only, it, 1 star because for some reason it is the only kairosoft game that gives me an error on start up and fails to launch on my Nvidia shield. It works fine on my phone but this rating stands until it's fixed on my tablet.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game, we'll worth the buy... Thats is if you like management games!
is, game, great, This, This is a great game I like the fact that they trick you when it's time to write a report when you win the summer series just to take you over here to give it a review but overall the challenge of losing your main characters and rebuilding to win the game it's a lot of fun I would recommend this to anyone
's, neeew, whole, It, It's a whole neeew gaamme~!
is, annoyance, huge, This, The game itself is pretty fun. but it is locked in landscape orientation all the time.  Not only that but you cannot flip the screen 180 degrees to the opposite orientation.  This is a huge annoyance when playing with it charging, but the charging port is on the wrong side for your charger.  And along with the recent trend in Kairosoft games, this game also turns off your music player when you open it.  I also think it would be better if this was pro baseball instead of high school.  I's kind of annoying that you build up players, but only have them for three years.  Early in the game it is very difficult to recover after your third years graduate and leave.

's, advice, only, That, Love the game wish they would port building controls from the snow boarding game.  That's my only advice.
