errors, technical, Previously gave it a one star due to technical errors on my side. However after playing the game I have cummed my pants not once but a minimum of seven times. Would play again.

game, ok, An ok daft timewasting game. You have to decide whether someone should go to heaven or hell (or later purgatory) based on their characteristics. Basically a new characteristic gets added per level. You get points for different horsemen of the apocalypse but it wasn't clear what the point of that is

slot, incorrect, EDIT: Yeah lol that review was really old so I'm redoing it. I had indeed selected the incorrect save slot at the time, I'm just a dumbass lmao xD Excellent game, no complaints, full stars! The gameplay is simple yet challenging and the humor in the game is really well done for the most part. Only complaint is it's not made explicitly clear that the horseman's points are bad and you want as few as possible, but that's a minor thing and really no big deal. Well worth the price!! :D

problem, only, The only problem I have with this game is in later levels the ways to determine if you send a person to heaven, hell, or Purgatory become very contradictory and I can't tell who goes where or what the heck is going on and it gets very difficult to progress because of this.

game, bad, Peace, Death! is not a bad game, but it isn't a good one, either. The graphics are pretty good, though, and the gameplay can be somewhat fun, but it gets boring very quickly. Still, I can definitely appreciate the effort that the developers put into the game.

thing, obvious, You have to pay really closely attention to every person. Miss one thing you lose a life on a elevator but one really obvious thing makes you lose. Every game there is something new to find. 5 out of 5 game
complaint, major, If you like Papers, Please this is probably a game you'll enjoy. Not as story-driven and immensely more silly. The major complaint I have is the cages that appear 99% of the time in endless mode, which singlehandedly ruin the experience for me. Once in a great while, you randomly get to play without them and the game is infinitely better. They should do away with them completely.

time, great, This game is really fun, it reminds me of papers, please and that's what I like about it. It can get tricky if you go too fast but overall it's fun and a great time killer.
killer, great, Honestly great time killer but one issue I've found so far is distinguishing blood on the individuals feet and blood under the feet to similar and makes it tough to choose. Really should distinguish it more.
game, favourite, Been looking for an alternative to "Papers Please" for a phone and found something even a little better. Probably my favourite game for a phone.

game, good, This is a really good game. Challenging and unique.
games, good, Too repetitive, not scary enough (it was on a list of good horror games).
features, new, Very cheap compared to some of the games I've played, plus with how long the story is and how it's constantly introducing new features, it's definitely worth the $2 (USD)!

self, explanatory, Game's fine, though the UI is confusing. Takes a while to work out exactly where to tap to do some things, and the effects of a selection aren't always self explanatory. For example, the 'influence' of the horsemen isn't well explained, and while 'more work' probably means more clients in the next level, is that permanent?

waster, Amazing, First of all, this game is fantastic. Amazing time waster when you're bored, it's fun, gameplay is smooth. I have encountered a bug though, because for me the audio always sounds slightly behind. You know? Like when youtube bugs out and the audio is always slightly behind what's going on in the video. Other than that, zero issues whatsoever, would give it 5 stars but the bug makes it a little irritating sometimes.

game, good, A surprisingly good game focused on pattern recognition and discerning differences as well as holding a multitude of rules in your head. I'm using in jokes a short and tight gameplay loop and a overarching narrative framing all make it a fun time waster

levels, further, Game itself is good, but I don't really see any point of playing it but simply for timekilling. Okay, you get further levels with harder difficulty, but there's no more to it. Still, decent game, I do recommend but for killing boredom mostly.

game, repetitive, The graphics aren't good enough for a game like this, to tell all these differences apart really fast but I guess that's the point. Just a repetitive memory game is what it amounts to but the concept is really cool.

game, cute, Minimalist Excellence It's a cute game where you play as a grim reaper and have to decide which afterlife people belong in. There are plenty of easter eggs and the game gets progressively harder in the best way. There is also some type of ranking bit where you get points for different horsemen but I have no clue how it works. But I'm sure you'd like it if you're into strategic leveling.

game, delightful, delightful game so far
game, similar, Entertaining for HOURS If you've played Papers Please, this is essentially a similar game except your rejectees get sent to a fiery afterlife. It plays in a way that you can Binge on. I do wish there was someway to restart a level, or to skip the intro. Just because I know some people like myself are perfectionists. A very fun game overall though.

mode, endless, This game is a ton of fun? I highly recommend it. Getting to endless mode is great. My only question is how to save the brain from the zombies!

game, Pretty, Pretty fun game. Just confused why devs think metalheads are so bad. We're like the most laid back peaceful group of people. Lastly why do we get all correct but still a B rating? Time maybe? Can only talk so fast.

week, first, I didnt really get it at first. But after playing the first week of the game I was hooked. Unique take on simple concept of sortation.

art, great, Its great art and everything is good, except the gameplay is based on just a very simple mechanic. And it tends to get repetitive, I'm gonna keep playing for longer and update this more than two stars if it gets better.

lame, Super, Super lame.
music, cool, Put some cool music in the game pls
obstacles, More, Just like papers please. People appear, and you have to work out if they end up in Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. More and more obstacles and pop up challenges thrown at you during gameplay. Very good.
time, little, I thought it would just be a little time waster nothing to fancy. However pleasantly surprised I just sank an hour of my life into this on first place. Its easy to pick up, challenging to master and great for a quick blast or a long game. Brilliant and well worth the price.

waster, Good, Good playful time-waster. The celebrities are a kick, the captions are sometimes worth a giggle, the imperfect English has its charm. I have a good time with Peace, Death.

gaming, Decent, Decent gaming so far don't enjoy the prompt to rate so early in the experience
games, best, Really hard I love it the game is one of the best games I've ever played
controls, terrible, Giving this game 2 stars for terrible controls. I don't get it. It says if there is blood on the floor and they have no weapon and have no horns and no blood on the body, they can be sent to purgatory. But it counts it as a mistake saying either guardian lazy or blood on the floor. Edit for developer: This IS a bug. I am not the first to complain about it and I READ EVERYTHING. Your game has a bug. Accept it, fix it, and use better English when responding to reviews.
day, first, I guess it's funny and cool at first, but I get no sense of direction or story. I just follow the instructions and basically do the same. I don't know, feels pointless after the first day or two.
game, addictive, challenging, fun, and addictive game expierience. wouldnt want to work for death any other way.

game, actual, It's an actual game without stupid Microtransactions. As such it already deserves five stars. But the gameplay is also superfun if you like games like Papers please.

levels, few, It's... not bad, but not good. The controls are wonky, and you aren't told much about how some mechanics work so you must just... take a guess and pray you are right. The characters you send to heaven or hell... seeing memes is fun, but after a few levels it just gets tiring. And let's not talk about the language settings... Spain's flag with a sombrero de charro? A whole a** mexican hat with Spain's flag? Really? All in all, a kinda fun game but not worth it.

experience, friendly, User friendly experience and fun
uninteresting, Quite, Quite uninteresting and gets boring quick, also nothing is explained properly
game, Great, Great game it tests your focus
stereotypes, Antisemitic, Antisemitic stereotypes abound. Guys with peyos and kippot only making comments about money or saying "Shalom, goy". Really gross on behalf of the game developer.
purchases, best, One of the best purchases I made on google play, only thing it misses is cloud save (or I just didn't make one last time I was playing)

fun, great, This game is great fun! Like mixing 'Papers, Please' with Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.
one, better, Game is great, really trains your brain to look deeper. No ads makes this game a better one for me.
game, fun, Very fun game! Similar to Papers, Please, but I found it more enjoyable. I wish it had more detailed explanations sometimes. Doesn't really explain much what the "influence" does. It asks you if you want to work for the other guys, but the only guidance is "You work for death, the others are his competition". So, should I not take those jobs? Other than that, the basic mechanic of this game is very solid.

reviews, other, I really wanted to like this game, and im sure in time I may have even grown to love it as much as the other reviews seem to claim. But alas, I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. There's no tutorial, no description. I clicked on the guy with the flag; what do I do? Theres no American flag, am I choosing my language? I clicked on the other guy with the tool and get a pop up and then the guy slips into the abyss and drops right back down. How do I even start the game?

game, nice, A. nice funny game I enjoy so far. But half the time I don't understand what's going on actually (the UI is not intuitive) and I don't understand why I get Bs on levels I passed without a single mistake. I replayed such levels like 3-5 times and still getting Bs. Oh well. It would be good to know why at least.

explanation, better, This is a blast. Pay attention to the details before you send souls to their destinations or you will fail like I have :( I do think that a better explanation could've been provided for your relationship with the Four Horsemen. Overall though, this game is a blast. It is....NICE!!!
game, great, It is a great game but it chould use some more i don't now what tho but rather then that great game

thing, real, Its just like the real thing sometimes when im judging souls for the afterlife I like to just play this game.
idea, great, Even tho is a great idea for a game, after downloading it; game's language was either on Korean or something else which made it impossible to play.
play, Great, AWESOME!! Great game play, cool retro graphics, you have to use your memory, plus great humor is a 5 star rating in my book. üòé

series, challenging, Fun, ever more challenging series of 'spot the difference' type puzzler. Esoteric at it's core, the developer leaves the player with a strange judgmental feeling. The graphics are distinct and clean. It gets a bit repetitive and can be slightly difficult to understand the navigation.

levels, reaping, I love this game! The controls are great, and I like how the reaping levels slowly get harder!
game, basic, Not bad for a basic game. Nothing special here other than training your reaction time.
mechanic, basic, This game offer a basic mechanic which is easy to learn but its getting more complicated and fun the more days you progressed. The in-game guide is well-written, I didnt play the game for 3 months but when I came back I just have to read the guide and continued. The dialogs in this game are also humorous and fun to read

localisations, suberb, Cheap, hilarious and very engaging. Really worth its price. Bonus points for suberb localisations!
instructions, Unclear, Unclear instructions, poor English, and not showing where you can click make this game too annoying to try harder. Also can't help but think the creators are antisemitic with one of the characters.
characteristics, special, Love the concept, however the graphics make it difficult sometimes to see the special characteristics to send someone to hell.
nature, timed, Would be game of the year contender but the timed nature, which makes no sense lore wise, kills the game. Shame yet another game so close to being good but killed by it's own creator.

feedback, more, It looks cool, but I can barely understand what any of the buttons do on the screen, there needs to be way more feedback and information than just fingers pointing where I can click. Even starting the game was difficult; Who would think the dark silhouette in the background is the START button? And the screen before you start a round and can purchase stuff: Are you able to scroll that menu? I'd hope so, because if you barely tap an option, it purchases it without any confirmation. Come on.

matter, laughing, EDIT: I'm happy you find this a laughing matter.. So much that I have a screenshot of comments that we're emailed to me from Google where you make fun of individuals that have Mental Health issues. It's a "lol" laughing matter to you. You've since changed your comment to, yet, another unprofessional one that you think is cute. I PROMISE YOU THIS. Since working from home I have a lot of time on my hands. I will spend a lot of it today in contact with Google to get them to pull your app.

levels, prior, Stuck on a lvl that says stuff can be washed away and send to purgatory but fails me regardless of my decision on where to send them. It is not clear! First it says blood on floor can be washed, then on body can. According to prior levels they should remain the same and if no hell signs work bit it just says failed each time.
content, humorous, Some humorous content but mostly boring and repetitive.
game, Incredible, Incredible game worth the buy. Super challenging and fun!

Not asking u lie if u genuinely hated it, but 30 secs to at least give an honest rating and help give real feedback to the devs of games u enjoy isnt some big offensive request, Karen.

Not asking u lie if u genuinely hated it, but 30 secs to at least give an honest rating and help give real feedback to the devs of games u enjoy isnt some big offensive request, Karen.

game, favourite, My favourite game so far
concept, clever, Played through about half the game. Its a clever concept but it gets old fast. Its just a simple game about making split second decisions sending people to heaven or hell as fast as you can based off what each person looks like(holding a weapon, covered in blood, red eyes, etc). After a while the process seems more stressful than fun.

taps, disappointing, This game has a very disappointing moment - nonworking taps sometime. At all other points it is actually fascinating. But... All this game about fast taping actions, so I'd like to see a new bugfix.

game, fun, Very fun game. simple premise that gets increasingly difficult and goofy as the sins and variations add on. even after playing the 1st part of the game, approximately 2hrs, there is a cool little extended gameplay. thanks to the team who put this game together. one comment: the game with the two open mouths that need to eat the sinners is way to hard, I think mostly because of the controls. maybe change it? have the controls for the mouths on the side?

level, second, Couldn't work out how to even play the game for about 10 minutes, then once I got to playing second level where you have to send people with horns to hell, you can barely even see the horns.

graphics, pixel, Saw a YouTuber play this along with papers please. I love the concept of being like a judge or gatekeeper where you have to catch people trying to lie or sneak in and you have to stop them. This game is very unique in the sense of, there is not just yes or no but three locations a person can go. Depending on if they sinned, or haven't sinned. or worship the devil, or worship God. And if they Atone for their sins. The pixel graphics does add a visual challange but nothing major. 4 stars!

creature, right, The game is good i enjoy it, but my person experience has been filled with bugs involving purgatory and sometimes elevators, i put the right creature in but it says i didnt and gives me a failed mark, more purgatory that elevators I'll put a human with no weapon no blood on them no horns but blood on the floor send them to purgatory i get a fail saying they had blood om the floor, maybe im not understanding a mechanic of the game but thats my experience

characters, detailed, Really well thought out game, you can tell the developer has spent a lot of time getting this right, with detailed characters and varied mechanics. The steadily increasing difficulty curve is good and manages to track the line between being too difficult and too easy well. Can't find a single bug. Look forward to seeing more from the developer in the future.

gameplay, Bad, Bad gameplay and rude dev. Better to throw your money in the toilet. The low-quality graphics makes it difficult to discern who to send to Heaven and who to send to Hell. Since this is the premise for the entire game, it renders this game unplayable. There are other games of this type on the Google Play Store, so you'll probably find what you are looking for elsewhere. Don't bother with this one, tho. Too many problems and this guy does not deserve a penny.

app, mobile, This game is INCREDIBLE for a mobile app alone, but is a fascinating game in general. I love how involved the player is in making choices. And each level is interesting and challenges your brain to not get into a kind of, "do the same thing over and over again." This is totally worth the couple dollars and I encourage anyone to get this game. (P.s. on a sidenote the music/soundtrack is fantastic and could make this game 5 stars on its own.

months, few, I'm sorry but unfortunately I did not enjoy the game or the dlc, can I please get a refund for both, it has been a few months since my purchase and I did not ask for a refund before before because I wanted to get interest on the game, but as you can hopefully see, I barely even played the game

quality, high, It seems like the type of game that, while simplistic enough to ask "Why isn't this free?", is also high enough quality to answer that question with "cuz the game would be worse if it was free-to-play." Bottom line: just pay the chump chamge for the game, ya cheapskates. It's worth it.

games, other, I've seen this game before on Steam but never quite get the chance to play it until now. This game is absolutely mesmerizing. The retro style graphics really make it stands out among other games. The overall fast pace along with the ever increasing amount of 'rules' that you've to remember makes it a fair and challenging experience that prevents repetitiveness. I also appreciate the myriad amount of pop culture easter eggs and references that always put a smile on my face. Highly recommended.

fan, big, Really enjoying this game so far. Haven't played too much, but gameplay is simple but fun. I'm a big fan of the graphics too, really well done. It's also fun to see the parodies while playing. If you're looking for something quick to play give it a go.

humor, great, an interesting concept and great humor added in with the game.
pace, reasonable, Fun, engaging, charming; I like the design and aesthetics. You can challenge yourself for A+ scores if you want to, but it doesn't seem to hinder progress if you slide by with a B. It reminds me a little of Papers Please with pattern recognition, and it changes things up at a reasonable pace. It's simple, but still challenging as you try to maintain accuracy with speed. Has a great sense of humor. Definitely worth the price.

game, whole, Not a fun game for me. I thought there would be more depth, but the whole game is just tapping left or right. Heaven or Hell, human or demon. They add factors to make it harder, but there is never anything more to your decision making than that. I guess the only point to it is to try and be quick. Very boring game. p.s. This is the second time I'm submitting this review in 12h. I got a notification that the devs replied, but when I came to check, my review was blank. Seems a little shady.

people, other, Not a fan at all that they used the likeness of tupac and I'm sure other people.... usually open to stuff and have a good sense of humor but I find using the likeness of a dead person to be bad in taste. Would like a refund

hell, good, Damn son, for this money you get a chance to build a reaper career. The music is hell good
game, great, great game. downloaded a year ago and still play.
log, daily, The game's going great so far but I think there could be a daily log in bonus or something to look forward to.
apps, Best, Best tinder apps for hell's occupants
game, great, This is a really great game for someone that observant and up to the challenge. It is a very great mobile game because it doesn't require an internet connection, you can play it on and off, no microtransactions, no daily login, etc... So you only get the fun of playing the game and none of the usual mobile game BS. The humour is pretty funny but I didn't understand the point of horseman influence until the very end (won't spoil it though) 10/10, well spent money

fun, much, I really like it! It gets frustrating, but it is so much fun.
while, little, super boring after a little while
mindset, kiddish, Gets slightly boring after a while. Progression with quite kiddish mindset.
challenges, new, This game is really fun to play. The mechanics are simple and it runs smoothly. I love the story and the theme levels. The art style is quite charming and I truly enjoy the humor it has, especially the kinds of people you send to hell, heaven, or purgatory. As you progress the game adds new challenges and you're allowed to aid or not aid whichever horseman you prefer. I'm never bored with this game! Also, it'd be cool if you could give your reaper accessories.
screen, black, The game is fun but every time I close it and comeback to play I have force stop it or it just gets stuck on a black screen and doesn't boot.

graphics, pixel, Resembles Papers Please, much more fast paced. Worth the money. And I'm a sucker for pixel graphics. Too bad I don't have the time to read the character comments if I'm aiming to get A+ from a level, but it's good that they're there if I ever decide to read them.
hours, many, Love this game. Loved it on the computer and now love it on the mobile. Thanks to the devs for many hours of fun !

stuff, own, very fun to play, clearly inspired by Papers, Please, but it brings some of its own stuff.
time, good, The game is straight forward and a good time waster. 1 star for constantly harassing me to rate the game
paces, fast, Worth the money and really is a game I got a lot of entertainment value out of. I personally prefer this game to people that like those fast paces decision games with pretty good humor. Though it doesn't get easier, it gets fairly challenging the more you invest time into it, making the game more balanced and difficult to how you adapt to the rules changing everyday of each week.

Some of the sentences are barely intelligible (especially bad with the phone calls). It's distracting and cheapens the whole experience. :/

awkward, little, This game is really challenging and fun but the controls are a little awkward. I know heaven is on the right side so I push far right and nothing happens so then I get confused and dont know what happened until I remember I have to click the elevator. I dont think that's a bug but it really gets annoying, but overall, keep doing what u do boi.

game, fun, Peace, Death! is a fun and brilliant game! It gets more challenging, the more you play it, and each challenge is different, which is great! The retro graphics, and fantastic gameplay, keeps you playing this game for quite some time. Definitely worth a try, and an excellent time killer. Thank you Devs, and keep up the good work!

instructions, real, absolutely rubbish, there is no real instructions on the game and after two minutes of the game being opened I kept getting an error message?! Not only did i get an error message but i couldn't close the app and had to turn my phone off completely.
bug, huge, The game itself is solid and interesting, but god there's such a huge audio bug that I can't ignore it. The music constantly skips every second or so, and I have no clue why, but its excrutiatingly annoying.
game, great, great game. so addictive
game, made, it's a well made game that requires focus for each item and grows harder over time
stores, predatory, Solid and Simple. This game sticks to its core concept and executes it in entertaining fashion. It's difficulty progression is smooth. It doesn't push predatory item stores at you and so ruin your gaming experience. Good Game.
character, female, ‚Äª WARNING ‚Äª This Game is based on SEXISM. There is only one or none female character in each set, and it jeers at hating sexism.
detail, little, dialogues are interesting. catching the little detail is fun. after 30minute, it's just rinse and repeat i fell asleep everytime I play this game.

games, mini, Let's say that the game deserves 4 stars for the gameplay but one star is removed because it simply doesn't explain some mini games and another star because of the douchy message asking for a review.

place, incorrect, Fun but controls a bit fiddly. Careful when tapping away text can send to incorrect place. Bit repetitive. Quotes can get in the way of looking for features.
experience, distilled, It's like Papers, Please, but a much more distilled experience. Effectively smoothing the gameplay to a perfect learning curve. It's quite a snarky game with good humor and lots of love.

games, similar, I enjoy this game a lot! It can be easy to presume that it'll start off easy, but it quickly rises in difficulty! The personalities for all of the horsemen are really unique, and add to the gameplay. If you liked Papers Please or similar games, I think that you'll find this game fun!
game, quirky, It's a very quirky little game, I've had a great time playing it. It's definitely one of the better games you can get If your looking for a shorter experience. I would recommend buying this game before going on a long car ride, overall It's a good game.

game, cute, I really like it. It's creative and different. honestly would be a cute console game. only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's difficult to tell whether a decision you make for one of the horsemen is good or bad. It seems like they could do more with them.

game, simple, It's a really simple game, but gets harder. It's like papers, please on mobile. The controls are really simple, just tap left or right.
game, okay, It's an okay game, but there's really no reason to keep going except to see what "job title" you get next.
game, nice, A bit repetitive in gameplay but is a nice, simple game. Not worth 1.49, perhaps 50 cents. Very reminiscent of Papers, Please. Well done.

levels, few, When i first purchased the game and started playing it was fun. Soon after i got a few levels in the game would randomly freeze and wouldn't respond to anything. I'd have to restart the game loosing my progress on the level as well as any money i spent and any mission i was on. This makes the game very frustrating to play and the reason I'm giving it such a low score.

reaper, grim, Unexpectedly tickled pink by this game, which I bought on a whim (I love the idea of playing the grim reaper). The game ran smoothly and the stories were pretty great.
gameplay, general, I like the general gameplay, but once the "paradox agents" show up it gets a little frustrating. You're given a vague outline of one of the multitude of characters and expected to recognize them when they pop up. I feel like this aspect could've been executed better.

game, good, Quite a good game and I love the graphics but it is very unexplained, I was rather confused towards the beginning as to what I was even supposed to be doing. Gets better the more you play but I am not sure it was worth the money.
purchase, additional, I have run into what I assume are a few bugs, but they may be features. The additional influence purchase seems to do nothing whatsoever, and whenever War offers me the "work the next day for me" task and I refuse, he keeps asking me to do that every time I go back to the horsemen after finishing a stage. Otherwise, the game is excellent, especially when it gets going.

phone, strong, Really fun but freezes too much to be playable and I'm using the galaxy s8 it's a strong phone the game was made poorly
reviews, such, The controls sometimes unresponsive. Fairly boring. Not sure on how it has such hi reviews

game, fun, Rather fun game. My only complaint is that the telephone calls don't seem to work correctly. Many times am I getting penalties for what I think is the right answer. Like "blood washed off, doesn't yield weapon, go to purgatory" and i assume yes but it's wrong. And other situations like this. Half the time the calls I get wrong, and maybe I truly am just answering incorrectly, but then the description is really throwing me off

game, nice, It's a nice game for a short break. Gets more and more difficult over the time. I would love to see more Minigames like the safe game. Overall I would buy it again.

way, Great, Love it! Great way to train your mind.
waste, personal, I don't get the hype with this game? It's boring and I think a personal waste of $1.50. The pixel work is ok. I didn't hate it but I sure didn't enjoy it.
game, Great, Great game! Pretty short though. Wished it lasted longer.
sins, visible, Papers Please but just without Documents, only visible sins
thinking, strategic, This is amazing if you love a challenge and strategic thinking I strongly recommend this game I may play this on my channel
job, only, The only job I have ever enjoyed doing and ever will. I look forward to this everyday. I play it like its my actual life style. I have a alarm set at a certain time everyday. When it goes off at a certain time during the day that means its time for me to clock in to work, and send a'couple people to hell a'couple, and a'couple people to heaven If they are special cases I send em to the purg and let them sort it out. Whos knows Another day another dollar as a reaper. When my shift is over I clock out and do it all over again tomorrow. üòéüëç

choice, bad, This game is AMAZING! I thought that it was going to be a bad choice to buy this, but trust me, you will not regret it!
graphics, amazing, This game has amazing graphics, and I really enjoy the pixelated theme to it. The cameos and character models in the game are hilarious. Some of the dialogue is broken but it's very easy to get past.

game, Awesome, Awesome game, love the humor literally made me die like 3 times, the art style is great, eye level get harder and harder but so does skill making the game seem challanging but not impossible just wish there was an infinite mode where you could just keep going until the elevator crash but still an amazing game and definitely worth the money (note I have not played the dlc yet).

game, Simple, Simple game that gets more challenging as you go. Similar in play mechanics as Papers Please. Some of the instructions are not clear or not applied accurately. Just played a level where I was instructed to send anyone with a bladed weapon or guns to hell. But people with mallets, and bows were also supposed to go to hell. So the original instructions that went out of their way to specify what types of weapons to look for were false.
