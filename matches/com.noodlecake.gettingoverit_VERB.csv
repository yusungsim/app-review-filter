used, to, mouse, Just as frustrating as with mouse. Still have yet to find out what's at the top. 10/10 P.S. if you're expecting the same thing as the PC then you're wrong. If you're used to the mouse then you'll be frustrated by the touch controls but you just have to understand that it's a new challenge, just like switching from keyboard to controller on PC.

pride, in, quiting, Very simple, yet extremely challenging game. If you pride yourself in never "rage quiting" a game, this game will probably give you a run for your money. Have you ever done a math problem where a frog is trying to jump out of a 12ft hole but everytime he jumps up 3ft he then slides down 2.5ft? Well... Same kinda thing but when the frog gets almost to the top, he may slip & fall all the way back down to the bottom, and instead of a frog your a dude taking a bath in a cauldron with a sledge hammer

rip, on, occupations, This game made me cry and try to rip my head off on multiple occupations now I'm a psychopath who wants to murder people best game ever
feels, like, journey, The controls don't facilitate the same PC experience Before I get hated because it's a rage game, let me eexplain. The pc version of this game is awesome. However, the Android version doesn't facilitate exactly the same physics, so things don't quite work right. Overall, the pc version feels like a journey to improvement. The Android version feels like I'm actually being cheated by the physics. I've beaten the Pc version, so I know what it should feel like. Just stick to PC.

put, on, controls, I'm all for hard learning curves and punishing game mechanics, I mean I play tarkov, but for Christs sake, put some on screen controls so I can determine what the dude is about to do. The exact same motions can have several different and seemingly random reactions from the character. I haven't played the PC version (I intend to, as I like the games concept) but as far as the mobile version goes, not worth my time.
GET, OVER, FRIST, HA HA HA THIS IS A MEME GAME I LOVE IT ITS FUNNY BECAUSE A CAN GET OVER THE FRIST (R.O.C.K) SO IM GOING TO UNINSTALLER THIS GAME. hay that for horses
taks, to, long, i dont relly like it beacouse it taks to long to lern the controls.
get, into, idea, Weirdly, I find the controls on mobile to be easier than on PC. Not nearly as frustrating (tho still plenty of cursing and gnashing of teeth - but then, that's the point!). Definitely a wonderful little time-killer, if you can get into the idea of it. Keep in mind that the game is not meant to be easy and you'll learn to love it.

get, past, obstacle, I understand it's a rage game and that's part of the fun, but god the controls are garbage on mobile. Your hammer behaves as if it has a mind of its own because you have next to no accuracy with your fingers, which cover part of the screen anyways. This game is great on PC, since you have that accuracy with a mouse. However a mobile port just wasn't necessary. You almost need a pen to even get past the first obstacle
compared, to, version, I have played the PC version and the mobile version is horrible. My hammer clips through objects and sometimes I lose control of the hammer as it spins around wildly Edit: After playing just to see the extent of the problems I found out that surfaces tend to be very slippery compared to the PC version and lag occurs that can throw off your "footing". I would just stick to the PC version because mobile controls aren't bad because they're designed to be bad but bad because they're bad.

got, for, phone, Played this years ago. Now I got it for the phone. Honestly, phone edition is crazy hard. No wide view, controls feel a bit more stiff. Still excellent with 5/5 rating from me
started, in, this, Just getting started in this and I am already having flashbacks to I am bread
played, on, PC, Have played on PC and now phone. The shittily done touch controls turned an already frustrating game into something completely unplayable.

think, for, point, Great experience and hard as nails, though I think even for the point of the game being to be hard, the rock next the red metal platform is ridiculously slippery compared to the other rocks, making it a more unrealistically forced annoyance, but beside that it really is an awesome game.

done, with, game, Look, im not even done with this game, and I can tell you, this game is amazing, it's challenging, and while the controls have a horrifically steep learning curve, I've been handling it well. This game is great use of time, despite it's difficulty, as it helps one deal with difficulty, and that is something everyone needs
controll, on, screen, Good but hard to controll on touch screen. They should really add an option to play with a cotroller
play, with, cotroller, Good but hard to controll on touch screen. They should really add an option to play with a cotroller
Gave, because, commentary, The controls are so horrible with touch screen. They are confusing and imprecise. Maybe that is the way its supposed to be, but making a game difficult because the controls suck is just annoying. Gave 2 starts because of the commentary during the game.
go, without, me, It is a great game the consent is fun but the controls are really stupid like il be using the Hamer and then it will go from up to down without me even touching it
Burn, in, B@##$, Burn in hell B@##$

listen, to, people, Don't listen to people complaining about the controls. Yes it is hard and has a learning curve and that's the point. The point isn't really to beat it, it's how you respond when you lose. You can see the passion put into every piece of terrain, Everytime you fall the developer hits you with a philosophy line. One of the most challenging games I've ever played, it's rewarding to see yourself improve with each run. What took you 2 hours one day might take you 5 min the next. This should be 5/5

found, As, someone, As someone who was able to (somewhat consistently) progress past the vertical tunnel section near the start of the game on the PC version, I found myself unable to make it past that section after over a half hour of trying. I kept tweaking the control settings, but it's always either way too sensitive, not sensitive enough, or somehow both. I hated the way that torque scales based on the speed and acceleration of your mouse on PC, but on a phone with touch controls, it is actually unplayable.

pass, on, it, A game for people who need to up the amount of stress and frustration in their lives. Runs smooth. The controls add an unnecessary layer of frustration however, which made me pass on it.
tells, from, start, Terrible. Awful. I hate it. Which is why I rated 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Right from the start, the game tells you, you might beat it, you might not. It doesn't give you a false sense of security, it literally tells you, don't get your hopes up: No amount of forward progress is guaranteed. It tells you the game will make you mad and it encourages you to take breaks if you get too frustrated. This game is so much more than a rage game. It's a valuable life lesson.
got, from, it, I got anger issues from it
go, with, it, This game is fun with a Carolina reaper on top. It's strange you stress about falling you fall you chill out and just go with it you get to the top. The controls could be a little better but I think that's how Bennett intended it to be. But overall it's worth the 8 bucks and with no adds its just a fantastic game. I definitely recommend buying it😁

play, on, mobile, Hard to play on mobile, but still really fun when you get the hang of it
locked, to, hammer, Please make a joystick control option for this i don't like how all the swiping is locked to the hammer, yes it is okay but because of the controls I got all the way to the 2 buildings near the top of the crane then got pushed off back to the start its a fun game but please add different types of controls so we can try get a feel for a different types of play styles

freezes, to, time, The controls are okay not bad but not good but can be annoying at times sometimes it feels like the game just freezes a bit time to time but rarely happens But without talking about the cons the game feels fun to play and a decent game to play while bored even if it can make you angry either from the controls or the game

play, with, all, As hard as it is, its fun to play with all it gives and I enjoy it. And I makes me realize something within all the insanity.
had, with, controls, Idk the game was pretty good and i like it. But i definitely had a very hard time with the controls and ik its designed to be that way but sometimes it would input things i had clearly not did like super dast sporadic movement when i was going really slow.

prove, to, yourself, Frustrating but rewarding you just want to prove to yourself you can do it LOL don't get me started on watching The rage clips on youtube it'll just encourage you more and you will rage more and more!

cooperate, with, finger, The only thing this $hit wants to do is not cooperate with your £uking finger, bounce off of things and push downwards to the bottom. Play the PC version because you have a mouse to easily use, unlike the mobile version which is ¢rap!

forgot, about, game, Almost a year since last update seems Bennet forgot about his game! Devs dont listen and with no updates how can you provide the best gaming experience! No update means the app can not perform as needed with the new technologies and updates! Someone needs to inform noodlecake and Bennet of this because it seems they don't understand why there is updates! Waste of money in my personal opinion. No updates, no leadearboards, no boosts, this game falls short in today's gaming world.

spin, in, circles, This game would probably be a fun challenge except I keep getting this game breaking bug that causes my character to spin his hammer wildly in counter clockwise circles launching me back to the beginning of the game regardless of my progress.
sit, for, hours, I broke my phone while playing this game but I still would 100% recommend it to you its the perfect combination of difficult but fun and it's a game you can sit on for hours.
do, on, S8, Really enjoyed this game. It is probably for a certain personality type... I managed to do it on Samsung S8 but I think Steam and mouse might be a more convenient input setup. I can confirm though it IS possible :)
broken, for, mouseless, the mouse controles are broken for mouseless
do, to, IM, I cannot do its to hard IM NEVER GOEIN ON THIS APP

attempted, in, ways, Legitimately the most difficult and infuriating game I have ever attempted to play, in all the best ways. May have finally found the game that causes me to snap a $1300 device in half. Well played.
spend, on, something, I only got the game because i seen YouTubers play it and I'd rather spend 5 dollars on something else
Took, over, year, It's a very unique game. Took me over a year to finally beat, and after that it was smooth sailing. This game can occupy a lot of time, and can be very fun to many people.
become, with, completion, This game is actually super short, it's just the lack of skill that makes it long, which I find pretty interesting, because with each completion, you become better and better and can beat the game faster and faster.
launching, across, room, You remember launching your Gameboy across the room because the game crashed right before you hit a save point? Yaaa.... this game will revisit some childhood video game trauma you never dealt with. You've been warned.
get, over, game, Amazing game but everytime I fall I get super mad but over all very fun game
see, in, Foddy, Beat the game. I'll see you in hell Foddy.
paid, for, this, Well, since i paid for this, i must complete it, that's it.
work, on, mobile, Just doesn't work on mobile.
wish, in, direction, Really wish the controls were more.. in the direction you're actually pointing, rather than following an invisible joystick centered where you started swiping

give, on, mobile, I wanted to give this game a try again on mobile, and regretted it almost immediately, and now can't get a refund for it. The game is good on pc and I've beat it around 100 times, but porting it to mobile is an obvious cash grab. The game doesn't work on mobile, it's impossible to play like you can on pc. Bennett, I hope you personally read this and understand how greedy this is, and that you're a bad developer for it.

The game is good on pc and I've beat it around 100 times, but porting it to mobile is an obvious cash grab. The game doesn't work on mobile, it's impossible to play like you can on pc. Bennett, I hope you personally read this and understand how greedy this is, and that you're a bad developer for it.
beat, on, mobile, People keep saying the controlls are bad and I also saw one that said it's impossible on mobile. The game is intentionally hard with purposely bad controls. Also the game is very possible. I have beat this game on mobile 25 times and 7 on pc. Both versions are the same mountain with mobile being harder, but still possible. Took me 8hrs to beat my first time, and now I average 13min.

add, to, games, Amazing game with a weird vibe and awful controls that add to the games overall difficulty and intent. 10/10
stuck, in, ground, This game is absolutely broken. I got my hammer stuck in the ground FOREVER. I want a refund and it makes sad that a really good game could get absolutely ruined because people are cheap and want to make not deserved money.
wased, on, game, Honestly I don't even think this game Dezurves a star It is definitely not worth£5 please don't wased your money on this game
listen, to, reviews, Don't listen to the negative reviews of this game they are just from people who have no clue what they are doing. This game is very difficult, and it is supposed to be that way. 5/5 stars, would recommend to anyone without anger management issues.

lag, in, butvit, I would give five star rating but it seems that when I reached the region where sky turns orange I don't know why. Game starts to lag..... Even I have good device If it Wasn't compatible on my device then it should lag in the beginning butvit only lags in oeange sky region. Please take a look at this...... :)(
payed, for, this, Im mad i payed for this is still not working
listin, to, others, Pretty fun game good controls and fun when you get higher and higher Btw dont listin to others that saw the controls are bad they are super good
love, 👌, 😁, I love how its such a challenge and to me thats the point of the game to test your ability to work from nothing to climb the tallest peaks and every time you fall its give you a memorable historical sentance sooo goood 😁😁😁👌👌👌😁😁😁👌👌👌😍.

expect, from, game, It's fine. What you would expect from this game on mobile. Not impossible to play. Definitely need to fix the controls big time tho. Should make the control more like a loose analog, not just free for all on the screen.

get, past, parts, Is this game worth $5? Nope. My biggest complaint is that the controls are terrible. Granted it's a mobile game so you shouldn't expect much anyway, but it's extremely frustrating to get past certain parts only to get launched in the opposite direction because the controls are either unresponsive or over sensitive. The only plus side is that this game is free with the play pass so you don't have to waste your money to try it out if you have that.

Shout, to, team, Really hard. Mad respect to anyone who finishes. Shout out to the mobile team for making this. I saw PewDiePie play this so I'm glad it came to mobile. Thanks for joining the android play pass. You guys rock!

trying, for, year, It's so hard I've been trying for a year 😠
boil, after, failure, Absolute gem, 9 wins in and I'm only enjoying improving more. Definitely at least £5 of value in this game. Great challenge and a patronising quote to boil the blood after a big failure always helps
used, to, words, man do I love this game. its great once you get used to the degrading words😂
rigged, on, mobile, Pretty much rigged on mobile so it's really not enjoyable
loosing, on, part, I kept loosing on the first part this game is RIGGED 😡😡 Getting over it more like getting pissed over it

playing, for, week, It's strangely addicting, but very difficult. I can appreciate the commentary as well. It does get frustrating, however if you take your time and take breaks it isn't so bad. I've been playing for like a week at the time of this review, and I don't think I've even made it halfway yet... But I can see the progress I have made and it's pretty satisfying. Sometimes you'll hit a wall, but if you keep trying you'll get over it.

optimized, on, mobile, not well optimized and extremely hard on mobile, beat it first on PC then try it on mobile to make the experience less painful.

talking, about, what, I don't understand what people are talking about when they say the controls such on mobile... it is literally just your finger on the screen. So far, very fun and worth the price.
go, into, game, This game is pretty addictive. There are poor reviews for functionality and responsiveness, and where they may be right, its still a good game. There are issues with the hammer not moving while mid-air to catch yourself, it just feels like it was made that way. If you go into the game expecting a challenge, let me tell you its well worth it. The creator made this game difficult and those reviews who complain about certain aspects are just complaints. There are ways to overcome the bugs. 💯

falling, as, part, He made the game to hurt you.... it's a frustration numbing agent. Genius! You will get used to falling as part of life is itself. Only intelligent people will understand this and source this element of love from the creator. This is why he said "I made this game for a particular type of person." Most Capricorns will understand the hard climbs we take all the time are just part of the game.

recommend, for, anyone, This game is absolutely beautiful. Between the well written lines created by Bennett, and the more quotes from others that truly inspires you to keep moving forward. This game is very difficult, but that just makes the ending so much sweeter. I highly recommend this for anyone who's up for a challenge, because this game keeps you on your toes!

Recommended, for, people, Super duper crazy weirdness. If you like this game, you will like it, and if not, you won't. Recommended for people who have taken philosophy 101, or LSD. Preferably both, I guess.
playing, for, time, Be warned, if you find this game difficult on PC, the mobile version is like playing Dark Souls for the first time, blindfolded, with your feet, using a trombone as a controller. Why? Because touch screens were not built for controls like this. You rub your finger quickly over the same spot over and over and you lose what little fine tuned control you have (if you had any at all). Had to turn the stupid quotes off. PC version is fine and easy, this version is trash

used, as, excuse, This game is dumb, I mean I get it's supposed to be a rage game, but Bennett just used it as an excuse to not have to try, in fact, one of his quotes was "it felt like it was more my fault as the player".
make, to, angle, This game DESPERATELY needs controller support! The controls are so unrefined in this game. Also, I lowered my 3 star review because I found out that this game isn't completable on mobile. The controls don't allow you to make minute adjustments to your angle, and as a result players can't pass the first diagnol cave near the start of the game. And before you say anything, I already know how to complete it, and I've already tried many times over. Just take my advice get the PC version instead!

throw, at, wall, Fun game. Did make me want to throw my phone at a wall a couple times, but fun.
reacted, to, fall, You know i honestly have never been to the top. Never over reacted to a fall. Never had to git off pissed. This app just let me know to stop being an arsewhole and waisting my time on unimportant things in life. Good app.

put, in, this, This game is garbage I'd doesn't have a tutorial the guy that speaks doesn't even help you he's just there to make you even more mad this game sucks it has nothing any other game has you didn't put time in this you rushed it has nothing. I would recommend updating it and give it something that makes it better this game sucks noodle cake studios it just sucks it has nothing
going, to, hell, -13615/10 I hope the creators of this game a die a very painful, tragic way and end up going to hell.
Frustrating, in, way, Frustrating in the most satisfying way possible. Beautiful commentary as you climb.

launched, to, bottom, Bad Controls. Why does the guy auto adjust the hammer himself, and also why do I get launched to the very bottom when I touch an orange, but trying to launch myself ends up with me going 1 inch above the ground.

allow, for, movement, Definitely as challenging, stressful, and frustrating as I was expecting. The controls could be refined just a little bit further to allow for more precise movement. Definitely a lot of fun as far as mobile games go. Excellent work.
celeste, in, regard, This is game is not frustrating. It's as Bennett Foddy says we create the mountain in our attempts to reach the summit. Every time I fall I know that when I make it back up I will feel better. This game is similar to celeste in that regard. In that game its the death count. In this it's falling. In a game like this when you fail you learn how to prevent this new failure. In celeste the first time I beat it I died over 1000 times. Now i can beat with less than 40. You can feel great relief then.

come, with, game, The most stupid (so called) game ever made. Some stupid company must've been REALLY bored to have come up with a worthless game. Isnt worth the digital space it's created in.
challenging, at, first, getting over it is a fun rage game. it can be challenging at first but once you beat it once or twice its pretty easy. c:
got, after, bit, Good, it was great, too hard tho got boring after a bit at least for me

is, for, developer, Haha 😂 there is a special place in hell for this developer. It's so bad it's good, I really enjoy how it's purposely made to frustrate the hell out of you while simultaneously telling you that it's fine and to simply get over it. Well done 👍!

played, on, platforms, Frustrating but entertaining, haven't played on any other platforms so can't compare but despite the common complaints the controls seem responsive and work well in my experience. The game is just difficult.. get over it

had, at, beginning, "Don't worry I'll save your progress" That was a lie bud.. I just re-download it and it had me at the beginning when my other device is still on the huge tree so... not professional for a game maker.. I'm going to uninstall it cuz there's no point if you don't save my progress... I'm going to discuss a refund with Google

translates, to, mobile, If you've ever wanted a unique series of cramps in your hands and fingers, this game is for you. You know it's a good game when it makes you mad but also makes you wanna keep playing. It's a quality game for the price, and translates quite nicely to mobile. Pro-tip: mess around with the sensitivity and input acceleration to better suit your gameplay experience. It won't make the game easy, but it will make it easier. Also, PHYSICS.
finshed, in, week, I've loved the game I have finshed the game in 1 week with out raging once I was always calm and when I fell I did it agien and agien and it got more easier feeling really good to finsh the game and we want part 2 please lets start another new journey with a new getting over it map
used, to, it, Absolutely what i expected, a great game. There is the issue of your finger being in the way but i believe thats just an extra level of added difficulty to an already insanely hard game. You can get used to it though, easier if your more than a casual mobile gamer.
put, as, star, I put this as a 5 star because it's fun but only when you get past the object and yes this game will get you.

result, in, movements, Used to be decent. Control system has been changed and is now overly gittery and chaotic. They seemed to add an assist system so minor movements will result in massive movements even with minimal sensitivity. No way to change controls, should have an option for a joystick mode instead of what they have. Would not recommend until they revert the changes. Uninstalled

recommend, to, you, The game itself is pretty interesting but if your not the patient and gentle kind, then I wouldn't really recommend this game to you. Overall it's a decent game with a simple purpose . (That is to obviously get over the mountain.) 3 starsl because I suck at it.

s, in, places, Very fun and sometimes frustrating but theres a lot of lag in some places I face, just like how certain games have lag when you look somewhere
playing, on, screen, The guys below me and below him is dumb cuz its for mobile lile bruh playing in pc is different cuz its pc ur using a mouse but playing on mobile using touch screen yea lol
felt, at, end, Such a fun journey. I cannot explain the amount of happiness and how content I felt at the end. This took me over 3 months to finish but it was very worth it. I actually play the game when im stressed. The sounds are almost ear-candy and the backround ambience is very relaxing. One thing I would add is the option to enable motion blur as I quite like it and some higher-end devices could probably handle it.

suffer, through, game, Hours of entertainment just watching other people suffer through this game. I absolutely love the whole concept.
flicks, at, point, Ok I guess, But i can't pass the 2nd level, at that point the game flicks you offa ledge and when that happended it said oof
playing, on, steam, This game is DIFFICULT. BRUTAL. I recommend playing this on steam. Mouse is an infinitely better control interface than phone touchpad. Love it though.
works, as, game, I think this works better as a mobile game. It's better to play it in small doses. Really satisfying to reach new landmarks on the mountain. Beware the jumpscare.

get, over, something, I like the game but every time I get over something I rage a lot
flings, at, speed, it's a great game and I'm just not good at things like this, but I have 2 complaints. it flings me at the speed of light with one wrong swipe and I cant control the hammer sometimes. other than that it's really good and I recommend it.

play, on, mobile, This is a frustratingly difficult at times game when using a mouse and keyboard. Touch controls could cause you to need blood pressure medication. I only gave it a 3* because the game itself is good. Just don't play it on mobile unless it's your only way or you're a massochist.
optimized, for, mobile, The game is the same as the PC version but graphics are optimized for mobile so there are little to no shadows.
yeeted, after, that, The game is good and fun sometimes but after my google play pass expired i opened it and after that it just yeeted me to google play and it was saying that my play pass expired and it gaved to me 2 options buy the game separaletly or buy the play pass Pls make it free

runs, at, 20FPS, It runs really, really bad on my Pixel 3a XL, but it's pretty fun when it runs at a stable 20FPS...
cost, on, Samsung, Love it but can you make it not cost money on the Samsung lol cool game it is challenging i Bought it with my money some people say that the controls are bad on the tablet I don't think thats true the only bad thing about it is that it costs money minus the money its a great game

playing, with, sensitivity, I would recomend playing with the highest sensitivity and high input acceleration. It makes this game a slightly less excruciating experience.
love, for, me, This game is utterly horrible for people who get mad easily, but for me I love watching my friends scream
wasted, for, game, Hey you don't have manners made this hell game my 7 $ wasted only for 1 game you made a very extreme rage game most of the player break their mobile pc tablet laptop remove this game from the world or I can hack you when I will learn LMAO

goes, in, head, fun but the main question that goes on in my head is bennet who hurt you?
adding, to, anger, Bad controls are adding to your anger. Which in the description of the game is what it was made for. For pushing you to your limit making you realize levels of frustration you never have guessed you could have experienced. This game holds a deep meaning that its difficulty contributes to. And if you're beating this on mobile as your first play through then beating it makes you feel much more accomlished than if it were easier. Everything has a place, even if it's not purposefully that way.

compared, to, version, This is an interesting port. The controls arent the best, especially compared to the pc version, but isn't that good? You aren't playing getting over it to have fun, you're playing it to suffer. The bad controls add to it. Your at the mercy of a shoddily controlled hammer. It makes you suffer more than the pc version, which is the games main goal.

covering, due, controls, Unforgiving game about climbing a mountain. Enjoyment on this game very much depends and how well you persevere and handle setbacks while a voice is egging you on. Very good port for the mobile, there are some inherent extra frustrations due to you sometimes covering too much of the screen due to touch controls but the game experience and feel translates suprisingly well.
launching, off, mountain, Worst game ever. I kept getting stuck because it kept launching me off the mountain back to the beginning where you first started from.

get, with, lights, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into and still I regret buying this game. I could not get past the cave with the lights
get, at, game, This is much more than a video game to me. The difficulty here is so raw. So real and pure. No matter how angry I get at this game, it always manages to calm me down. The climb, music and narration are sirene, the falls are devastating.
place, on, something, Okay, so the thing is, I've beaten this game twice now. Once on PC, and once on the Iphone 7. It's a HARD GAME, so understandable a lot of people leave bad reviews saying "oh the controls suck" and like, its really just them wanting to place blame on something. But since I have beaten it twice on two different platforms, I can honestly say, the android control are really BAD. Great game! Hard game, and I'm still gonna try and beat it. But, why does the iPhone have better controls? Lol

fall, to, beginning, The game is really hard but still, it's great. It has a original concept and nice design. It's very unique in its play style. Good game overall. (Exept when you fall to the beginning again)
scaling, with, sledgehammer, After weeks of unsuccessfull attempts at scaling an impossible construction with a sledgehammer whilst trapped in a couldron of infinate water I have no choice but to accept that the simple mechanics, the singular goal and the constant beratement for failure makes this game a unique charm to play.

go, for, game, Love the game but the controls aren't very good. Pc is the way to go for this game.
love, if, it, It's a infuriating game, but I love the hell out if it. The controls suck but you get use to it. Just mess with the settings til it fits what you want. Figured out how to get past the lights. Will update as I go.

compared, to, version, This game is impossible on a phone..the input lag is terrible....ive adjusted the settings as best I could but the game mechanics feel jenky compared to the pc version
getting, past, section, "Bennett shut the f*** up" is one of the thousands of things that I've said while playing this game, if you don't want to get mad or frustrated I suggest you don't play this game it is very difficult just getting past the first section.
agree, with, mistake, Honestly, being a patient person to a great degree, this game is inspiring, challenging and humorous. However, I don't agree with the slightest mistake putting the player ALL the way back at the bottom. If people are willing to give the game a chance, then at least give them some hope and incentive that their efforts won't be totally in vain.
getting, over, it, Hey getting over it it's just how do you get past this obstacle can I tell something those lights they are so annoying for me to get up because you made a really bad game for yourself the all YouTubers does not wanna play a game but I'm trying but I'm trying to beat this game too many pros beat that the game I want to be a pro like that but it doesn't matter you just have to be treated Li Well so I'm not that frustrated well the days getting over it make a nice game take that fantastic so that

fell, because, Foddey, This game is made to make you mad Not because of its difficulty But because of Bennet Foddey mocking you whenever you fall Bennet I just fell all the way back to the beginning I don't need to hear a poem made by Abraham Lincoln
make, to, hard, the game is fun but to hard can you make a ez mode
stuck, at, level, too hard help im still stuck at the first level
think, of, anything, I enjoy this game and can't really think of anything in terms of improving it. However, if you are to download the game then prepare to feel emotions such as anger, anxiety, happiness, sadness, and possibly etc. This is part of the experience, as this is a rage game after all. There ARE going to be times when you finally reach a point you've been trying to reach for quite a while, just to fall down again. Once again, this is part of the experience and I'm just telling you what to expect.

tapping, after, move, Please make fixed controls, the game is so annoying when you have to keep changing the finger by constantly tapping the screen after Every single move.
play, for, HOURS, This game is so frustratingly fun. I'm a very angry person and this game surprisingly calms me down. I literally can play this game for HOURS. My only complaint is that the controls are touchy and that can be rather annoying.
rely, on, luck, Interesting game. Yeah, I like it. You can concentrate on how you hook the hammer to climb/fly higher up, or you can rely on your blind luck by just spinning the hammer round like a mad man. You probably will feel like screaming if you manage to get within a few pixels of the top, only to fall a great distance down. But the fun is in the journey, not the destination. 5 stars, because it's really good for what it is.

die, on, inside, This game is fantastic at what it's ment to be doing, and he even let's you refund if you die on the inside, which I did. But I bought the game off steam so don't call me a sissy. This game is astonishing though, which is also proven by the refund policy. (Which most games don't have.) His point isn't to infuriate you, it's to make you work harder so the reward is more fulfilling. If it was as simple as getting over the tree at the beginning then you wouldn't have confidence for barely working.

f'ing, of, game, It is a MUST try, painstakingly painful, excruciating difficult, notoriously repetitive, meticulously unforgiving, unforgettably memorable, delightfully satisfying, brilliantly crafted, unmistakable unique, completely addictive, mother f'ing of a game!!! Can't wait for a new map or v2. You said it is "designed to hurt a particular type of person" ... I love you and hate you at the same time! Well done ... Just well done!

hurl, at, wall, Heed my words, my friends. This is the most frustrating, the most infuriating, the most enraging game I have ever played. I have seen many a Youtuber freak out, scream, & even hurl chairs at the wall over this. On mobile, it's much more difficult. But no matter who you are, this will plague you.

stands, to, version, Its fun and stands up to the PC version. Of course the PC versions controls are 100x better. They still wont add controller support. Some people dont have a problem with using the touch screen controls but alot of us do so you need to add controller support. Just add it! Your score will increase dramatically on the play store. Update: Will you please add controller support?! just add bluetooth controller support so we can use a controller or mouse. This should have been done long ago.

refunded, in, life, I've never refunded a game so quick in my life. All I have to say is, its definitely more fun watching other people play it.
burn, in, hell, This honestly whoever made this game could burn in hell the controls are so stupid it never goes to where I point
came, to, creator, i installed it it coz im very curious when i see a streamer playing this game..so i buy load and buy the game but i realize that im only wasting my time..and now i unstalled kt already..but my money/load didn't came back..to the creator kf this game,please give me back my load😞😤
swing, in, direction, The controls are not responsive, and no, I don't mean the mechanics, rather, I mean that half of the time the character doesn't swing the hammer in the direction I touch, and he doesn't pull back said hammer even if I'm touching over the character model, he just keeps it extended. You'd think they'd get the controls right when porting a game that's all about precision.

's, to, it, The controls make this game unplayable. It's absolutely terrible. There's no consistency to it.
looking, for, what, The never ending pain and syffering just what i was looking for also its so claming to hear the narrator after losing so much progress
get, past, chimney, Solid greatness can't get enough of it ☺️ not past devil's chimney yet but I'm determined 💪👌
run, at, settings, I have a phone that can run games like Bully at max settings yet this game at low settings lags like a motherf*cker. Don't waste your time or your money. It's obviously a cash grab with no effort made to optimize it. Touchscreen controls are god awful as well. Skip this one

beat, on, phone, People dont realize that this game is in a category of games that is made to piss you off. They are called "B games". The narrator even taunts you as you fail and mess up. Not a game for snowflakes. They will just piss and moan. That being said, it is significantly easier on PC/Mac. Having a mouse just makes it so much more playable but I beat it on my phone and im not someone you would call "good"" at games. If youre easily irritated or a snowflake who rage quits... Just dont

respond, to, input, The cursor doesn't respond the same way to the same input and the part trying to climb between the rocks with the lights is nothing but RNG because you can't swing up and arc down on a screen at the same time

got, to, part, Bad controls, and when I got to the lantern part right after the big slippery chunk of metal, there's this small rock you have to get onto, but it was WAAAAY to slippery and I spent about an hour and a half on that part of the game. All I'm asking is to make the rock not as slippery and the lantern vertical tunnel a bit more wide please

keeping, for, stream, So frustrating and like why would it cost money but I didn't have to pay cause I got google free passes one month trial but still oh my god! I'm only keeping this for a live stream on my channel
Listen, to, me, Listen to me. Mr creator. I'm going to find you and make sure this is your only form of transport for the rest of your life. This game is like a bad relationship. Keeps hurting me but I keep returning. But also love it
Fun, for, seconds, Fun for about 10 seconds before the controls hinder you more then helping. The concept would be nice but the controls make it nearly unplayable.
snap, in, noodlecake, Why tf its so harsh and the controls are so scuffed and I just want ro snap my phone in half noodlecake really went downhill
beat, in, hours, I beat the game in two hours its not hard still a good game tho
do, to, na, Chapem ak ma niekto rad vyzvu v hre. Ale toto je vyzva do zivota hrat to na mobile
bouncing, for, nothing, Fun but frustrating. The controls are annoying, with the hammer sometimes bouncing for nothing.
played, for, yourself, If you haven't played it for yourself, you have to
listen, to, noobs, Awesome game, don't listen to the salty noobs that couldn't complete it
came, on, mobile, Loved this game! So glad it came out on mobile!
playing, for, game, Little bit hard at the two lamps and small hole but it's very interesting and I stopped playing pubg for this game
used, to, orientation, Play this. It's like getting used to one orientation on the Xbox and then someone inverts the controls. So learning to play COD with the controls inverted. Maybe it's like a mix between Robinson's gilligans island, Jackie Chan's drunken master, and geometry dash. I'm dyslexic too dev, so special thanks from all of us getting extra fugged. You're creative and sardonic and I like it.

play, on, phone, Fun but it's too hard to play on a cell phone
runs, on, settings, Don't waste your time, I'm a massive fan of the game on pc and have completed it many times But even on the lowest graphics settings this game from 2 years ago still barely runs on a brand new flagship phone. If you own a hypothetical future phone that can run it the experience is much the same as the real version and could probably pass the time pretty well

get, After, wins, After 100 wins I didn't get the golden pot
updated, to, Android, Works great, until it doesn't. This game worked great until I got a new phone (Pixel 3a XL) and updated to Android 11, when it proceeded to run at what looks like ~20 fps. It's pretty unplayable at that fps due to the type of game it is. Hopefully this is fixed.

hurts, after, while, Would easily have my 5 stars if it was compatible with the s pen, the constant movement of my finger on the screen hurts after a while.
came, in, 2008, A game inspired by a simple B-Game that came out in 2008, entitled 'Sexy Hiking'. The objective of the game is to simply drag yourself up a mountain using a hammer. The mountain itself is a rough assemblage of seemingly random objects and assets from other games and areas. The player has to make their way up the unforgiving heap whilst constantly being at the risk of falling and losing everything.

rage, at, game, I find it funny how people rage at this game, I actually find it really fun and relaxing, the music, the voiceovers, although I never finished it, I still love it.
hangs, on, moto, Game always hangs on my moto one power I win 50 time but pot didn't turns to Gold
turns, to, Gold, Game always hangs on my moto one power I win 50 time but pot didn't turns to Gold
gone, into, game, This game is savagely difficult. Unfortunately I don't think I am the target market for this game. All that said I recognise that effort has gone into the game and the concept it is exploring.
collect, from, peoples, Your game is free in black market then why you collect money from innocent peoples
beat, from, point, The game hates you winning the things I could do i can't its like the game won't let you when i completed the game it crashed and wont let me re open thats proving the guy who created gets a kick from you failing and when you win you can't play because you beat the game from a developer point of view there still big changes you need to make before publishing it worst game ive ever played i would rather play the orginal
get, to, it, Nice game...but controls sucks May be I'm new to this so felt like that think I get habite to it
playing, for, time, Dude..... I am literally playing this game for the first time on the day of my marriage. Luckily, my wife apparently "gets it" in the same way I do; i.e., we both find the concept funny and the gameplay surprisingly absorbing. Thanks. It's nice to have weirdness. It makes the world a more beautifully horrible place.

play, for, time, k know when people play for the first time they will rage and give the game a 1 star review but when you finish it's sooo worth it TRUST me
turns, to, gold, Graphics not changed and pot not turns to gold even I win 50 times
hoping, for, luck, What I expected. Similar to the pc version. Hard but not impossible. Will take more time to get the precision/instincts to make conscious progress rather than maniacly swinging the hammer hoping for luck. I'm going to dread the 🍊
completing, for, times, Even after completing it for 60 times... I didn't get the golden pot. Is golden pot only available for IOS and PC users, not for android??
Frustrating, like, other, Frustrating like no other
pushes, to, opposite, Such a waste game is this after going up he will not control himself and automatically comes down and he pushes him self to opposite so change this property if you dnosent change this property i will not suggest this game to every one i will say delete this ge to all

coming, from, PC, Controls on phone are not the best coming from PC playing this. The game is still intact however and once you get used to controls it is more forgiving...psyche.
get, to, places, I love how it mskes me mad then i get so happy when i pass the part i couldbt get past. Can u add coop ? Thatd be fun and maybe you add settings where you can interract woth other peoples hammers to help get to higher places
blowing, with, osmmmmm, Sexy app 😍. Mind blowing with osmmmmm
introduced, to, concept, It's confusing and challenging yet gets a bit zen, I don't want to say too much, that could effect user experience but it has introduced me to the concept of b-games and I'm now quite curious to explore more. I'm also a harsh critic when it comes to ratings and this is close to being a 5 star game based on concept, but the initial frustration with understanding would not let me give 5 stars even though that is part of the game experience. This game made me think.

watch, on, YouTube, It's so difficult it gets boring. Definitely not for everyone. Really not sure who it's for. Serious game players only? Absolutely gorgeous design and sound design. Just watch it on YouTube, much more enjoyable.
designed, on, principle, Within the first 2 minutes I was addicted. If they made a multilayer fighting game designed on the same principle it would be epic!!
come, from, version, I come from the PC version. Took me 2 hours on my first try playing the smartphone version. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I think there can be a few performance improvements that will help the game run better. The entire map and the background can simply be just one big picture file, with layering effects. Diogenes can stay how he is. The focus of the camera can render a part of the area it is focusing on. The game was a bit intensive on my phone. That said, GET OVER IT!! HEHEHAHAHAHA!!

get, on, Pixel, Too laggy to get consistent control on a Pixel 3. I understand that difficult controls are the point of the game, that's why I bought it, but this goes beyond difficult controls into pretty much random behavior on this device. Basically no correlation between input and outcome means that progress doesn't feel earned and setbacks don't feel like they're your fault. Unengaging and unsatisfying.

beat, on, mobile, I love it then I hate it but it will not beat me TT much harder on mobile think it makes it extra fun. play this instead of cutting yourself itself cleaner :)
bad, at, game, Everyone in the comments pressed because they bad at the game lol 😆 😂
leading, to, satisfaction, Brought 8 hours if pain, all leading to pure satisfaction after beating it.
SKILLED, IN, ORDER, DON'T F***ING PLAY IT! IT IS A RAGE MACHINE! IT IS HARD AS HELL! YOU HAVE TO BE SOOOOOOOOOOO F***ING SKILLED IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS!
stuck, in, pot, The game is toxic it makes no sense like how did a guy get stuck in a pot controls AWFULL the game itself HORRIBLE and nobody plays it anymore and graphics are ok but could be better
expected, with, testing, Passes the time. It has a weird spin that kinda starts you all over, but thats to be expected with beta testing. At least it makes it more challenging, which gives you a feeling of accomplishment whenever you pass something. I haven't finished it yet, but it's a fun game, and I'm determined to complete it.
thank, for, experience, The control's are super hard on phone than on a computer thank you for the experience but this game is only good to play on computer

deleted, after, mins, Controls are whack don't do what you want them to and for such a simple game, more frustrating than anything else deleted after about 2 mins
kept, for, days, This is a hard game but you have to keep going and practice, I hated the game before, but then I realized that not being able to do it was my fault, so for 3 days I kept playing and on the third day today, I beat it and it was super rewarding.
keep, in, mind, It's so frustrating and I like it. Controls are great. This game is for those who have skills and patience. One thing to keep in mind, it drains the battery quickly.
download, for, me, Amazing game hard that means playing longer funny but when try to download for me it repeats download or says can't download
overcome, at, times, When you first launch the game and start your journey you might think this is easy but trust me 15 hours later and many frustrating falls back to the beginning I finally completed it ,which gave me a sense of pure satisfaction and happiness that I finally overcome the seemingly impossible challenge at times. To sum up I would recommend this this game to anyone with a bit of patience and someone who is looking for a great game well worth it's £5 price tag. Pleasure to play thank you creator.

go, to, part, I gonna give it three star because I couldn't go to the next part.

get, over, mountain, I find this game's setting oddly relaxing. The music is also pretty neat. While it makes other people rage, I find it relaxing to get over this strange mountain.
respond, to, controls, The character doesn't respond to the controls (touch screen is broken in-game) I want my money back for this massive scam
