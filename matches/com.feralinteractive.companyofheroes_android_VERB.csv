waiting, for, multiplayer, I've been a fan of the franchise and the mobile version is pretty good just waiting for multiplayer
downloads, despite, connection, DLC downloads so damn slow despite my internet connection of 100 Mbps. What happened? I downloaded the game so quick but dlc is Soo slow. Please fix this!
died, in, specialy, Awesome game. But annoying simetimes if i order my troops to attack or being attacked there is some tendincies they are unable to move when i need them to back a little bit or hide another positions. I always resort to tap RETREAT in order my unit to survive, nor died in action specialy when controlling TANKS or VEHICLES the FACING POSITIONS are unable to function sometimes, i am android user, Poco f1.
remembered, from, childhood, Solid port just as i remembered from my childhood.
see, in, screen, Overall its realy great game, the port quality from PC version is realy well done, although I wish i can change the UI size so i can see more in small screen
pop, Except, destruction, The port have obvious downgrades in graphics & control, but it ran well & I'm surprised how the control works here. Model, texture, shadow, reflection, destruction are low if you look closely. But, they are there! Except destruction (stuffs like cover just pop off) & cutscene, the rest look nice in play. For control, I recommend you to leave it with wheel menu & adjust it in the advance setting menu. Considering how fast-paced this is, it actually work very well. No download issue on my device.

Play, in, tablet, Play this classic game in a tablet is great but in a smartphone it is very difficult.
playing, since, release, best rts in mobile right now. playing this game since release. i think the only problem for now is that the ui are fixed. and i recommend independent sizes for every ui like the map ui is perfect but the action ui is too small. and i wish that their somewhat multiplayer so that we can play with fellow mobile player.

work, on, tablet, Might work ok on tablet but extremely poorly suited to screen on a pixel 4a. UI takes up 80% of the visible screen, every time I try and pan the camera, it issues a command in error. Requested refund through Google, told not in accordance with policy despite only purchasing hours ago and only struggling through the first two tutorial missions.

downloaded, for, S7, I just downloaded it for Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ and it runs perfectly fine. Hopefully you can add the multiplayer mode sooner!
work, on, Se5, Great Game, didn't initially work on my galaxy tab Se5, the devs contacted me when it did. Played this when it was released, and it holds up with touch controls.

enjoying, on, screen, I have played 3 missions on Z Fold 3 and everything seems to work well. The controls are a little finicky at times, but all in all I am enjoying this game on the large screen.

make, By, time, Absolutely great campaign but the skirmishes and absolutely unfair and unplayable. By the time I can make an infantry unit ad fast as possible the enemy already has a tank and several emplacement and flame throwers before I can even get to the bottom of the street. ABSOLUTELY RIGGED SKIRMISHES. but the campaign gn is a blast... that's about the only fun part

add, on, phones, I've been a huge fan of the game, it's very fun and exciting on the pc as well on the mobile. There are 2 things i would suggest: 1. Pls add a ui scaling feature because on mobile phones, the bottons and hud are blocking 60% of the screen 2. If possible, add a 60 fps feature I'm so happy that this is ported to the android platform

love, to, ad, Absolutely awesome and complex. In a Galaxy S9 (Snapdragon) in some cases like when are a lot of action and buildings, soldiers etc. the performance decrease not much but it is very clear that it doesn't run well and five out of ten it just crash. (i will love an upgrade to ad: fonts size- graphic, performance in general configuration.)

progress, in, campaign, Great game. Issues with DLC which other people seem to have too where you can't progress in the campaign due to it never remembering where I left off. Yes I have restarted my phone etc etc it's been the same issue for months. I've been waiting gor an update which never seems to come. Edit: changing to a one star as I cannot progress on the Germany campaign due to constant crashes

Waiting, for, textures, Waiting for HD textures.
put, on, list, Well i have been eying this and now its on sale for only 3 dollars. I just wish you update the devices compatible. My phone is samsung A52 5G. I hope you put this model on the compatible list.
feels, like, setting, Great game. Even with HD pack downloaded, the game feels like lowest setting on PC. However the biggest let down is that it does not have multiplayer. Update it to support multiplayer and many woudl be very happy.
play, on, zenfone, I can't play it on my asus zenfone 8. I already give permission to storage but still can't play it.
commanding, on, phone, Loved the game on PC. Takes some getting used to commanding squads on a mobile phone but I'm determined to master it. Would give a higher rating but the tutorial keeps glitching and getting stuck on certain spots. Will review again once I can actually start playing.

drop, like, map, Amazing game. Runs well on pixel 4 XL and pix 6 pro. Controls, especially grouping, take some time to learn. Real time strategy but much appreciate pause, lol. One suggestion: Everything is a little small. Maybe drop some elements, like map?
add, on, android, Hey developers, i hope you guys can add more amazing old pc games on android.

play, in, player, The game is really good. I hope that the next update they give us new map to play in single player since theres a low chance it will have a multiplayer. since the pc ver. Has a 700+ map pak add those map here.
had, in, order, I buy the dlc pack Everytime I pick British army voice actor were silent.. in order to get their voice back, I had to play new story mode.. and then exit. Play new skirmish pick British and there you go their voice are back.. please fix this bugs
enjoy, from, childhood, Ok, there issue seems to have been fixed. Idk what the issue was but I am now able to enjoy this game from my childhood.
ported, from, game, Great game ported from a PC game to mobile. Mobile/wheel control a bit hard to use especially when moving screen but I'm glad they have the other control option. Moving troops is a bit hard but still a great and enjoyable game. I hope it will have multiplayer mode.

sucks, on, phone, Complete waste of money for a mobile app. Probably pretty cool on a PC but sucks on a phone. Takes up 15% battery life just to load. Way too much going on for a phone. Commands suck, too hard to get troops to do what you want. Definitely wish l didn't spend $15 on this glorified POS!

think, In, opinion, NICE GAMEPLAY! GOOD GRAPHICS! In my opinion, i think it would be fun, exciting and more interesting if you add zombie mode in game or k9 units.. but over all its still 10/10 for me..
upload, as, update, Love the game, hope COH 2 can be upload as an update for this version as i pay a lot just to buy the game and content.
suggest, on, update, The game is great !! The only thing I want to suggest on the next update is to make a game with a multiplayer. I recommended it in my friends but we can't play with parties like in the PC

hope, for, release, I downloaded the game and it is very beautiful and realistic and I am a fan of the game series and I was and still hope for the release of (COH2) for Android as soon as possible. This will be an achievement for me and the fans of the game, and I know that the second part of the game needs a powerful phone to run it, but this is easy. The important thing is the release of the second part for Android I hope so..(The Russian army must be present in this game)
Love, about, it, Yes! Best rts for mobile! Love everything about it!
play, on, s7, I bought this hoping to play it on my tablet s7 or s6. It is great game I am excited to see it come out at a tablet Platform or for a chrome book compatible game. Please look into these as options as most people play these games for the immersion. Small phones are not ideal for these games. Think about Rome total war, how many people really play it on phones besides just the kill time. Most probably play on tablet out of comfort and the ability to feel immersed

walk, from, side, The games too difficult on mobile device not to mention the mission I'm on is near impossible considering enemies from out of nowhere just walk in from the side of the map and take resources I've already taken.
progressing, through, campaign, Great game for the platform it's on, sadly not 5 stars due to bugs in the DLC content that prevents me progressing through the campaign. I recommend they do a patch to fix this as it does ruin the game a bit.
play, with, brothers, I use to play this on PC years ago with my brothers and best friend and it is just as amazing as I remembered.
come, across, bugs, Awesome port of the game, funny enough my first time playing the game will be the mobile version. I've had an RTS itch for a while, and this scratches it juuust right. Though pricey for a mobile game, content wise, other RTS games can't compare (no online matches sadly). I did come across two bugs though, mission briefings get really quiet for whatever reason. And in the British DLC on the Carpiquet mission, the two Stuart tanks you're given don't show up when you try assigning them to a squad.

assigning, to, squad, Awesome port of the game, funny enough my first time playing the game will be the mobile version. I've had an RTS itch for a while, and this scratches it juuust right. Though pricey for a mobile game, content wise, other RTS games can't compare (no online matches sadly). I did come across two bugs though, mission briefings get really quiet for whatever reason. And in the British DLC on the Carpiquet mission, the two Stuart tanks you're given don't show up when you try assigning them to a squad.

supported, on, tablets, Fab game but not supported on latest tablets? (Not like the s7+ is even that new) bought this to play on my tablet as phone is too small imo for a game like this.

paid, with, amount, stop buy this game...i paid this game with full amount...game not fair,hard to control and plenty crash!
challenging, on, phone, This game alone is challenging and even more so on a phone. It's amazing! The strategy involved keeps me playing it for hours!!

match, on, galaxy, screen size does not fully match on the galaxy Z Fold 3 and touch controls sometimes do not work at all
playing, on, k20, playing on redmi k20 pro. its awesome
purchase, within, game, Listen I love this title but i seem to be having issues purchasing and downloading opposing fronts. Any help would be appreciated. There doesn't seem to be a method i can see to actually purchase it within the main game.
keep, on, troops, A very fun and obviously strategic game. It makes you multi-task because you need to keep an eye on all your troops. Plus, slight resource management. All in all a very good WW2 game.
turn, into, equipment, Can we have more updates? We need more. Definitly one of the best rts WW games out there. I would be so happy if we can get online fights like the pc version and the mod where you can turn the game into modern war equipment. It would be amazing
edited, because, problem, I edited my review because of the problem I encountered. It happens to me two times now. My downloaded dlc's always being erased after online verification. please help me fix this problem ü•∫

played, on, phone, Without a doubt the best game ive ever played on a phone. Sure it got some stability issues with a few crashes about one per 2 hours gametime. The thing is that so did and does the original pc game. The controls at first feels kinda clunky, awkward and takes some time getting used to. Then you realise they actually managed to port a t-board and mouse RTS game to your phone. Absolutely amazing work Feral.

installing, on, S10, Great Port, its the full PC CoH game, well worth it. Not had an issue since installing every works perfectly on my S10. Fantastic work
waiting, for, anygame, DREAM COME TRUE! i've been waiting for anygame like the pc version of this, but there no other game like coh. when you release it on android, its like a dream come true to those who love RTS type of game. Hopefully you guys could include in the next update of coh. like "tales of valor, company of heroes 2" and other british expansions that would be awesome. you guys did an amazing job porting this to android. hopefully on the next update you could include new units, tanks, building etc..

have, on, mobile, I love this game it gives me the same feelings as halo wars 1 did and that was my all time favorite RTS! I love that you can have this on mobile the gameplay is very griping and there is a bit of sadness that you feel when a man goes down and dies. At least for me I was like... That was one of my men and that was my fault. Over all the game is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see what the devs do next. Personally I should love to see the campaign go all the way to Berlin.

drop, at, guns, Great game. I just wish to have my airborne to drop the at guns like the m3 and pak 40
stuck, on, mission, Very Good but a bit buggy on android and sometimes the game gets stuck on a mission so u have to restart
going, in, screen, Pretty darn fun. Kind of hard to get used to especially because theres so much going on in the screen. But on a pad this would be great. Either way i got use to it and have been enjoying this game!

playing, for, phone, It's company of heroes but for your phone I've been playing the original since 2007 I'm also in the company of heroes 3 alpha. It's a bit awkward to play I'm on an galaxy S8 it runs fine no crashes but controls are bit awkward mainly for reinforcement, construction and squad management. It's just same old coh but no multiplayer just ai skirmish yeah literary just coh1 but mobile.

played, on, pc, I loved the game when I played it on pc. On mobile, controls are not intuitive and there is a constant lag. I'm playing on a note 20, so I would expect no lag. Have problems when selecting units, or when wanting place mines or sand bags. Overall.. mediocre experience üò™

looking, for, what, Exactly what I have been looking for. I cannot find a single traditional RTS game on the store without 30 micro transactions. I will come to check what Feral has released often and can't wait for the next mobile adaption! I would like to request the ability to change the graphics settings to higher levels. Can there please be an update so samsung tablets can use this?

playing, on, mobile, Love this game can't stop playing. I would give it a 5 star but I gived it a 4 bc it does have problems but when downloading it does give you a notice that playing on a mobile it will have problems. But it still works and love it. when and if the Creators update the game I hope that they will fix those issues and then I'll give it a 5. Also I'm hoping that they put more Missions and let us play Online. And a Another issue is that it kills my battery so fast and that part I'm not happy about...
progress, through, game, Sometimes the game crashes. Then there are some parts where you cant' progress through the game when you precede the dialogue.
driving, through, area, Tank traps don't actually stop tanks from driving through the area they are placed please fix

tried, over, course, Would have liked to play it, tried a few times over the course of a few hours and was having issues with touch response and frame rate issues. For some reason every time I touched with one finger, the interface thought I was two. Trying to manage the interface, regardless of issues, is a hassle(although done pretty well considering). For some reason I couldn't manage to get more than 20fps on this. S20 Ultra 5G so it can play it. Sadly I requested a refund. I may buy later after updates.

click, For, example, I love the original on the computer, but the mobile version has some problems, firstly, it always crashes, secondly some of the Input. Methods are really difficult to use. For example, to double click and hold and then direct the fire of a weapon or machine gun is impossible to do so I have to quit the game. do not buy.
played, on, phone, This game is the best game to be played on a phone...whoever idea is it, its brilliant...anyway can you guys also put the company of heroes 2 in android too...I would totally appreciate it...thank you for this wonderful game....

settle, for, layout, Excellent , exactly the same as PC one of the few games actually worth the price, the controls do take a bit of getting used too, I find the radial wheel selection to awkward so settle for the other control layout That aside it's company of heroes where ever you want too play it, and that's well worth the price of admission.
played, in, PC, I played it in PC, well here in Mobile I have to adjust, in controls and I find myself struggling at first, I suggest that don't try to play directly hard or expert, the AI on this game are monsters compare to PC, they can swarm your base with tons of armors together with a Platoon of infantry, using AT infantry and mortars, unlike in PC game that oftenly use, great job, getting it on Mobile the way it was on PC, 5 stars you earned it,

Played, on, S10, It's the full pc game from 2006. It's a good port, controls aren't too bad, would probably be better on a tablet due to size. Definitely playable . Played on S10 plus
made, for, phones, Just like the computer version wish more games would be made for phones like this one
had, on, s20, The issue that i had on my galaxy s20+ is the same that happened on rome: total war, i bought the game and everything was runing smoothly and great, after 5 days game keeps crashing, everytime i enter the game it keeps crash.

comes, to, games, Wish they had more games like this one. One of the best I have found thus far. Even went back and played it again. Wish they had more operations included. Do not know any game that competes when it comes to games you can play on an app.

ported, to, mobile, Well worth the cost of entry. Game is very well ported to mobile. Small writing might be an issue for some bit I think it can be adjusted somewhat.
wrote, without, compromise, Did you nerf the ai for mobile? If so, maybe you went too far? Normal was punishingly hard if you were inexperienced or very rusty on the PC version. That isn't why this review lacks a star per se. That's more because you wrote "without compromise" and after my first skirmish i found that there was no multiplayer and no replays. If you didn't do such a good job on executing the rest of the game, it'd be 3 stars.. but you nailed everything else so 3 stars would be unfair. I'm mostly satisfied.

gets, towards, game, Fantastic port of the best RTS ever made. The controls are quite good considering how complex it can be when it gets hectic towards late game. And it runs silky smooth on my s21 ultra, which is crazy to think about as when I bought this at its original launch on pc it needs a pretty hefty computer just to run it. Just needs Bluetooth mouse support then it'll be perfect.

Played, on, computer, Cant even open the game! Refunded after 10 attempts. Played it on the computer really hoped to play it on my S8 which says can support the game. (Edit) Purchased again yestersay to see if it was a bad install and its finally working. Yay!

looking, for, games, Simply so good. If there are any new contents to be added, pls do so. Gameplay is really smooth and I was looking for a true RTS games for mobile and I'm glad I found this game. Simply awesome and it's the same as the PC counterpart with some minor changes in controls to suit mobile phone. Didn't regret a bit paying for this awesome game.

play, with, icons, Excellent port on my Pixel 5, however lack of tablet support (Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+) is very disappointing, the hardware can certainly support it and I'd rather have the choice to be able to play with poorly sized icons etc than not at all. iPad availability suggests that the game can work on larger screens.

ran, on, Oneplus, The game itself is great, ran well on my Oneplus 7 pro even though its not officially supported. Graphics and fps are good for mobile, if you follow the tutorial it's pretty easy to get the hang of it. It's a hard game so expect to get beat if you haven't played an rts before. The issue, for me at least, was the size was to small. Even with my glasses, after 30mins I was suffering eye strain. Refund was painless, from Google play. I'll stick with the pc versions. Would work better on a tablet.

bought, As, graduate, As a recent game design program graduate from VFS, I bought this game to study how to implement PC strategy game (specifically the control part) to a mobile device. I think Feral studio did a wonderful job of making the mobile controls intuitive. Additionally, this is my first ever purchase of a game on through the app store. Do I regret it? Hell no. I am just impressed that we reached the age that our phones have the capacity of playing PC games. Please keep up the great work!
implement, to, device, As a recent game design program graduate from VFS, I bought this game to study how to implement PC strategy game (specifically the control part) to a mobile device. I think Feral studio did a wonderful job of making the mobile controls intuitive. Additionally, this is my first ever purchase of a game on through the app store. Do I regret it? Hell no. I am just impressed that we reached the age that our phones have the capacity of playing PC games. Please keep up the great work!
dissapeared, after, restart, Later edit:Problem dissapeared after a restart.Great game.maybe i m a poor player, but on skirmish, even on novice cpu i have a hard time winning üôà Awesome but on my note 20 ultra with latest android on skirmish when i set machine gun emplacement direction, at confirm game exits.

immerse, for, hours, Utterly amazed that my favourite PC game of all time is now on mobile. The power of modern technology. Controls are a bit wonky but it is a loving creation and a joy to immerse yourself in for hours. Just don't expect esports level gameplay üòÇ
play, with, friends, If ur able to can u add multiplayer? Cause Im wanting to play this with my friends but I can't.
adapted, for, devices, This is the same as the game on PC except it's adapted for mobile devices. The game is still best played on PC but the mobile controls are decent enough. The only thing that seems to be missing is the voices for enemy units.

loved, on, PC, I loved this game on the PC and thrilled they ported it to mobile. I am hoping they will incorporate online PVP but skirmish vs CPU is still fun. There are no official how-to's posted on the you tube channel on how to play British and Panzer Elite. Still deserves 5-Stars easily.

add, to, game, Great job guys! Keep going!.....just please also add tales of valor DLC to the game..you are doing great!
play, on, s20, I loved this game and was extremely excited to play it on my samsung s20 ultra - with a heavy heart I asked for a refund. The issue was that I could not decline the google services with the games crashing or glitching. I never made to the game menu. The feeling was that after I paid for this product I could not use it without google. That is truely a shame i hope the companies fixes this somehow. Its because of my love for the game, I give 2 stars instead of 1.

Love, without, regret, Fun. Sometimes having trouble with certain actions/commandes where the game makes the wrong decision or doesn't understand what I want to do. But ik general, great game with great gameplay. Minor screen errors/graphic errors. Love the purchase without any regret of it.
coming, to, devices, For a mobile game this is great! Never would I have thought PC strategy games would be coming to mobile devices. This one plays really well for mobile and the controls are easy to use.

reset, for, reason, I finished half of the german campaing and stopped playing. the next day I decide to play again.But now my progress has been reset for some reason it keeps happening
do, for, sake, Do not be fooled by the fact that it's in mobile, it is a triumph of adaptation for this to be available in this format. Of the many recent pc additions to the mobile platform, this is by far the best. It's more complicated than a mouse and keyboard, and might warrant some getting used to, but for goodness sake, do it. You will find no better RTS on mobile, they knocked down some of the graphics, but not the game play, this is not a phone adaptation of the PC game, it IS that game
played, on, PC, If you ever played it on PC. The nostalgia is great.
work, after, update, Awesome gameplay! But after the update the game won't work :( it just keeps synchronisation on save files and crash

runs, on, mobile, Very good game, runs well on mobile and has a good tutorial. I would suggest adding multiplayer. But apart from that it's a good game. If multiplayer is added I will change it to 5 star.

have, in, pocket, Takes me back to 2008-09. Now I have it in my pocket. Best game on my phone presently. I wonder If you aim to bring the last expansion tales of valor to android?
reminds, of, command, Great game reminds me of command and conquer!!
demo, In, mission, In mission Best bridge won't demo
enjoyed, on, PC, The same old Company of Heroes I enjoyed on the PC, except now I can play it anywhere! Highly recommended!
demo, on, mission, I purchased the expansion, and I'm trying to complete the German campaign. However, on the 'Best' mission the engineers won't demo the bridge. When I highlight demolishing in their wheel/queue, nothing happens... BUG? Love the game... brings back great memories of the desktop version. Can anyone help me with mission 4: Carentan counter attack? I'm destroying just about everything I can, and I'm struggling to hit 200 kills... how am I to ever reach 350 to get the bronze star???

connect, to, device, I love this game! I was able to connect my phone to a bigger touch screen device and the game worked perfectly. I do suggest a few things though: 1.) Add multiplayer. 2.) if people have a hub or dock station for their device, allow control settings for people to use mouse and keyboard 3.) Maybe add something similar to steam's workshop where peaple can mod the game.

Changed, to, stars, Plays the same as PC. Easily worth the buy. Changed to 4 stars instead of 5 because the Brit campaign runs into a fatal error in the first mission so I can't play thru their campaign. Skirmish works fine with all the DLC tho.

played, since, release, My dream come true. One of my favourite games ever, now right in my pocket! I've played CoH since release and still play to this day and I can honestly say this port is 1:1, controls take a game or two to get used to, but after that it's great for a quick game now and again. If this supported mods, like blitzkrieg I'd absolutely lose my sh..head. keep up the great work Devs, absolutely phenomenal work. Running as smooth as butter on Google Pixel 5

play, on, devices, Constantly crashes and controls and camera are clunky on my phone. Possibly better with a tablet but hard to play on smaller devices.
running, on, phone, Nothing like old school coh running on phone :)
minimise, for, example, Definitely not worth ¬£14 I still play the desktop CoH which is legendary but this struggles to compare Buttons are too big in places and some are too small. Commanding troops and selecting certain troops is sometimes a challenge Would be nice to be able to minimise for example the Map when not needed for more screen space. I would reinstall but I think I'll stick to the desktop for now. Mobile version is a long way off to becoming close to Good and actually enjoyable to play Refunded for now.

Started, on, tower, Been playing since it first came out! SEARCHED for a pc to play it. STILL playing the ORIGINAL disc on laptop! Started on a tower!
won, in, mode, Not happy with the game ....... It's just too slowl to get points...I played seventeen times and never won even once in the skirmish mode...... It's like you buy the game for losing all the time... So if you're reading my review please don't waste your money and time on this game cause you can't win... Even when you play easy mode . .... This game wasn't made well

adapt, for, mobile, Great game, but it's so clunky. Moving units and camera angle can be soooo annoying at times. Poor port on that, could have tried to adapt it more for mobile. Other than that, great game from my childhood
keeps, on, toes, Easily one of the BEST games for Android. I am blown away by how incredibly good and fun this game is. It keeps you on your toes and is very exciting/fast-paced, while still requiring logic, as well as a basic understanding of strategy vs tactics. It is also thought-provoking, and due to its historical accuracy, CoH inspires one to reflect on the sacrifices made by the heroes of WW2; sacrifices that allow us many of the freedoms we are able to enjoy today. This game is a masterpiece. Period.

Seems, like, oversight, Game runs ok, why are newer Samsung devices not supported? Seems like an odd oversight to have it only be compatible with the older Samsung models. Refunded my purchase because of this

played, for, time, I've always loved CoH but I haven't played it for a long time. When I saw this was coming to Android I was buzzing! I've played a few levels and it's just as good as I remember it! The controls aren't good, they definitely take some getting used to but anyone who played it on PC will know it's a very involved game with lots of detail and it's tough to take over to the phone - but I doubt they could have made the controls any better. Please bring out the expansions ASAP! EDIT with DLC I'd give 6*

get, past, it, Great game, great port, may glitch but just needs a little troubleshooting to get past it. Played company of heros 2 on pc. I've learned now the occasional glitches and crashes are just part of the company of heros charm.
lol, for, timing, Great game, I need a bigger screen but that's not the game it's the hardware! Question for Feral, will their be more factions introduced? EDIT: Opposing fronts just came out, how's that for timing, lol
Feels, like, game, Feels like the real coh game on pc. Wait. It IS THE REAL GAME ON PC!! I remember playing this on low settings on my run down pc back in the day and lo and behold even after downloading the hq pack for this game it still looks and feels like I'm playing the low setting game on my pc. Put in multiplayer and I'd be satisfied by the cost. This isn't a cheap game you know.

counts, with, battles, Super fun just the kind of game i love to play. Get to build lots of structures and every unit counts with massive battles that change very quickly.
crashing, on, X3, Game is constantly crashing on my POCO X3 And it's capped at only 30fps

ran, into, bugs, Interface is surprisingly good for a PC game port. Only ran into a few bugs where units freeze when placing mines or picking up MGs.
played, for, hours, I have played this game for hours upon hours on PC. This is an excellent port to mobile and a great RTS experience. If you enjoy strategy, war games and RTS, this is the game for you. This truly is the PC game for mobile. Beautiful work and with every dollar spent.
controls, on, mobile, Pretty good port, controls tougher on mobile though
support, on, phone, Nice finally support on my phone
expected, from, app, So far so good. Lovely visuals and storyline. Controls are slightly clunky but its expected from a mobile app. Great job.
release, on, version, I really love this game!! For the first time has been release on PC now its like a DREAM COME TRUE!! When you release it on Android version!! Never disappoint me when it comes to graphics almost the same as PC version!! Kinda hard to control at first but when you master all the command controls this game will ROCK YOU!!

ported, to, mobile, This port is surprisingly good! Will the DLC(s) be ported to mobile as well?
play, on, screen, It's good but I'm hoping you will add support for Galaxy Tab S7 it would be so much better to play this on a better screen. I initially bought this because I thought it would work on it

settle, for, less, Why would you settle for less?
played, on, PC, Wow... this is really impressive. I've only done the tutorials and a skirmish but honestly I'm really happy. I can't believe that all my favourite old games are now on my phone... this is the actual game. üëå honestly I've played 100s of hours on my PC and I'm definitely gonna be on this a lot. You been a bad boy Adolf, and now you shall pay!!!
sits, in, games, Really stoked feral made this happen! Tutorial is a must even for 10+ year veterans of the game. Only thing I would like to be able to tweak is the ui it's takes away from a beautiful game. Maybe opacity and or no gray background just some options like that. The finger controls are well thought out, but a pretty good learning curve after a decade of mouse play. Thanks! This is the only game I can say that it is now 15 years old and still sits in my top 3 favorites games.
buy, via, IAP, GALAXY FLIP ....WORKS PERFECT .....(NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BUT SO FAR SO GOOD ), How do I buy opposing fronts via IAP....is it out yet???
run, on, Snapdragon, No reaponses to game performance issues on flagship phones, that are somehow not supported, no update for months. Upkeep may be dead on the game. Wish it ran well. It doesn't even heat up my phone too much, just doesn't run well on Snapdragon 855 which runs a lot and was top 99% in benches on release in 2019.
wrestling, with, controls, This is not really playable on a mobile phone. Super frustrating, wrestling with controls. Probably a reasonable ft in experience on PC.
reminds, of, command, Amazing game! Absolutely love it. Almost reminds me of the old pc game command and conquer but ww2 based. Love it
playing, on, phone, Just playing it on my phone is already awesome in itself. It is one of my favorite RTS game on pc..
plays, On, Note20, On my Galaxy Note20 this game plays like a dream. The stylus really helps navigate the detailed interface on the relatively small screen. Keeps my ww2 habit fed when I can't get to a PC. Definitely recommend. First tactical I've grown to like.

used, to, it, Wow just wow, this game IS AMAZING. This is my favorite game and I am so surprised that this game was added to android. I really enjoy the game and the controls can be hard at first but when you get used to it its fun as hell. I also want to mention is that you guys should add the British and Russian faction and a few more maps for 8v8 and 6v6 and add snow maps. Also please add coh 2 but overall this game is AMAZING :)

says, in, purchase, Love this game but how do I purchase opposing fronts dlc says in app purchase but I don't see any options for it
Creeping, from, Aim, Adding the rest of factions and operations is all I want I can the technical difficulty of adding things like Creeping Barrage from the British and Direct Aim from Tales of Valor campaigns but please make it happen for me

Thank, for, reply, Thank for the reply. I eagerly await the release of Opposing Fronts.

crashing, on, s10, Love it need more missions. But all the sudden it started crashing on my Samsung s10
waiting, for, Fronts, Still waiting for Opposing Fronts. Is there an update when is the release date?
wait, for, game, Awesome. Loving all my feral interactive games. Cant wait for the next strategy based game they release.
shoot, to, angle, It's not a bad port of the first game but it really needs some optimisation, getting my troops that can only shoot a certain angle to the angle I desire is tiresome and cannot be done at the speed this game needs. Unless it's optimised for mobile then it's not worth anyone's money.

play, on, screens, While this game is a great port to mobile devices, I find it quite difficult to play especially on smaller screens. Graphics are way worse than playing on a mid-spec PC. Add to that I end up losing on the campaigns even on the easiest difficulty due to controls. Unfortunately, I can't get a refund from Google Play, but I wish I could. I want my money back.

get, into, game, Update: I just deleted my original post seeing how I'm able to get into the game fine and play it fine on my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5g even though when you start the game it tells you the phone isn't supported well it is and after I finally got to play the game and get somewhat familiar with the touchscreen bedroom instead of the PC mouse version I'm living the game . Period end of story it's a phenomenal game especially on a high end phone so just download it and try if you have my phone

having, for, weeks, The game worked really well! I really enjoyed it! But alas, After having it for about 3 weeks the game crashes upon start up every single time now and will not get passed the start up crashing screen. I'm kinda disappointed but they'll probably will be fixed.
playing, on, pixel, Im playing on a google pixel 3a (mid range phone) . It works great. Sunk alot hours of lockdown into this. Would love to see expansion packs brought back too! All in all great job bringing this gem too android!

expect, from, game, Best RTS game on mobile period. Has every element you could expect from a p.c game with the easy fluent controls of a mobile game. I honestly must mention the fact that this game was brought out 15 years ago the graphics and fluent gameplay are quite breathtaking. This game was a head of its time then and stands to compete with games of this generation. I couldn't recommend this purchase more for the small price they're asking compared to p2w games and they're ridiculous in game purchases.

works, on, v60, Everything works fine on my LG v60 (so far), I think the graphics can definitely be improved and I still don't understand why my device is not supported. I do see a lot of comments about unsupported devices so just be careful before you purchase. I would like a better way to select units from the bottom box without selecting more than one. Yes I could group these people up, but in the battle it's hard to get your unit to where you want to go without selecting another. Multiplayer would be nice.

Frustrated, in, terms, Frustrated in terms of issuing a command it wont wire demolition charges it keeps saying invalid ability target please fix this.
use, with, Stuhs, Great game, worth the money, but it could use some balancing like with the Stuhs, I was playing two normal AI and the enemy had 9 Stuhs, at one time.

changed, to, something, It's absolutely mad that this has been ported to handheld. 10 quid to play a fantastic game that actually works, looks, and plays fantastically. If you've played the original version, the new control system can be changed to something you are more familiar with.
made, to, version, Pretty cool, but it doesn't have all the original features of the game, however some of the changes made to the android version made some of the control features better. It's rather difficult to play this game on small screens, but if you're good at micromanagement and love the original COH this app will definitely bring you back some memories. If you're new to the game you might wanna try learning on the PC version first if you have the means. Hopefully they'll integrate the other factions.

come, as, updates, Controls can be wonky but for a port of this game, this is flawless, I do hope that the British and other German factions come later as updates or maybe DLC, and also if they can add multi-player online play or atleast local with steam or Google play friends
ask, for, refund, Game stopped working and had asked me to contact customer service. They provided no solution to the fix and just said that they were unable to provide a solution and to ask Google for a refund. Terrible customer service.
advertise, as, port, Misleading, they advertise it as the "no compromise" full port of the game but there is no multi-player whatsoever, beware this is campaign only.
suck, with, screen, Love it runs smoother than expected. A bit clunky on controls and suck with a small screen but nonetheless definitely worth.
play, on, pc, I've play coh on pc for years, and when I see it was out on phone I was kinda skeptical about it. I figured oh well I'll try it, what I was thinking was all you got was the campaign. But there's also ai battle's 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 which is honestly kinda nice. it's a pc port to phone so the controls are a bit off what did ya expect, to me it runs great and a good past time if your on break at work can save your games and come back to them. A true and great RTS on mobile and pretty good for $13.

dealt, with, bugs, I would've dealt with the bugs and bad graphics if only I could build a barracks. I've played this on PC before but no matter what I do I can't build a barracks in game. After all the frustration I'm glad that I was able to get a refund.

get, on, phone, I played the PC Game and it was outstanding, I am just starting to play this version and its great as I get the hang of it on my phone I will probably give it all the üåü. I am loving it on my android and has met my expectations already. Graphics, sound and game play is great on my S9. I fully recommend this game. Would also like to see some additional packs later. Thanks for the Android version.

compared, to, pc, I like it even though the graphics are lowered compared to pc.
ported, to, tablets, I'm a massive fan of COH but I'm very disappointed with this version , it's so clunky on a phone and it's just near impossible to play as it won't let me rotate the camera properly , will it ever be ported to tablets ? I have a tab S4 and would love to see if it's any better I'm not going to get a refund because I want to believe that this wil ll get better. I hope it does anyway.
Plays, on, S10, Top class game on PC and a brilliant port to your device. Plays great on S10+ and very easy to get used to. I just hope the other games in the series are to be released!
updating, in, future, When is the new update for new missions? Are you still updating this game in the future for more missions?

Hoping this game update make others friends to join, with HD, add other alliances to participate besides only this two alliances.Control a bit difficult but they guide to use, sound are good and the rest system roles game awesomely.

uninstall, despite, costs, Game looks awesome but controls are terrible on smartphone, can't pass tutorials...very frustrating. This should be reviewed and improved. Had to uninstall despite the costs...
add, to, game, Is it possible to add Xbox controllers to this game?
do, with, multiplayer, It's fun could do with multiplayer
buy, from, PC, I will continue to buy every game Feral ports over from PC. They are doing God's work and are deserving of our support. It is fantastic. I'm begging you Feral.. on my knees. Age. Of. Mythology!!! It is destined to be a mobile game and you may as well capitalize.

give, because, bugs, Love this game, one of my absolute favorites, can't give 5 stars because of some bugs I've noticed where I'm not able to build certain buildings and units become unable to move after trying to build certain buildings, already sent support ticket so when fixed will change my review
moving, across, map, Game is good, controls are clumsy. One tap to move a squad is a poor choice of control, I'm constantly accidentally moving squads across map, making them lose battles and making me want to throw my phone. At least add a deselect squad control. Good job capturing the game though, runs really well.
port, to, handheld, Undoubtably a fantastic game and a noble effort to port it to the handheld but the learning curve for the touch controles is too much for me. I uninstalled it. I got too frustrated. 90% of my brain power was dedicated to getting the units to do what I want...and with only 10% left for strategy.... Well....the results weren't pretty.

see, at, point, Thoroughly enjoying this game so far I would love to see multi-player in at some point to really enjoy this like I used to like back in the day even if it's just battling ai for the time being

stick, with, it, I am really enjoying this game so far. My only previous experience with RTS games is Age of Empires, so this is a bit different, but I like it. It can be really overwhelming for a beginner like me especially on a mobile with touch controls, but if you stick with it you'll get a really enjoyable game.
done, on, mobile, This is an exact replica of the game done right on mobile. Thank you for the work your team has done to bring this to mobile. I do have one question. How do I access unit specific upgrades like a flamethrower for Engineers, or mg42 for Grenediers, or 50Cal for Sherman?

play, on, tablet, Love this game! Just wish I could play it on my tablet.
improve, on, device, Please improve the frame rate its too laggy on my device
play, on, S7, Honestly it would be better if could play it on my tab S7 plus.
change, in, first, Company of Heroes for your phone!!!! It is great. It is the original game intact for your phone or tablet. So great it hurts. However there are some things keeping it from being a 5 Star ‚≠ê that may change in the first but as of now may be big issues for some. 1. Graphics and performance are dependant on you streaming vs downloading the maps and upgraded visuals. 2. Multiplayer did not exist when I purchased and may or may not come. 3. There are 2 control schemes. The default "mobile" is bad.
remember, from, PC, Just as I remember it from PC, great job, waiting for expansion packs. Oh I just learned that You guys managed to bring Xcom 2 to mobile... im still picking my jaw from the ground, can't wait for android relase, thank You for such a great work.

runs, on, Note, Love it, runs great on the Note 10+. Only small thing I wish for is the ability to use my S-Pen. I think the devs could make it pretty useful.

Played, on, S8, Phenomenal port of a great classic game. This is the entirety of the first Company of Heroes single player campaign. Well done. Played just fine on an S8.
runs, on, Pixel, A very well done port! I LOVE this franchise, it runs beautifully on my Pixel 4XL. Haven't tried multiplayer, but single player and skirmish are fine, great for offline...The other reviews are correct about the controls, this game is not meant for a small touch screen...Trying to micro or multitask across two parts of the map with clusters of units is nearly impossible without pausing and generating an order-queue. A suggestion, make a CoH-lite for cellphones. Need a RUSE-style macro view

Playing, on, screen, Nothing like pc. Playing on this screen, even with the real estate a Note 8 gives I have some issues. The controls are not the best, and I found myself moving my whole force as a single unit rather than using maneuvers which was a sort of disappointment. I finished the first mission, and I'm sort of not looking forward to Carentan.

love, about, it, I absolutely love this. I love everything about it. The controls are a little weird but come on, its a computer game turned mobile. I love this.
used, to, them, Absolutely wonderful game! If you love RTS Games. The controls are a bit iffy. Once you get used to them though it's well worth 14 dollars.
move, around, map, Good game - controls need a bit of work, I am finding it very hard to move around the map. Also finally able to download maps but it takes a long time, stuck at 0% for ages then starts downloading.

install, after, mb, The recent update doesn't install after 45mb as it's Cap, it kept taking my internal memory up to 1gb and still wouldn't stop after reaching 100%. Edit: finally fixed.
hold, for, sec, Its a good game! The only things it misses are these three things: 1_need add a botton for construction instead of touch hold, cus when you moving the screen you usually touch & hold for a sec which pops up the construction window all the time. 2_should add the setting "camera speed" that would make is even better. 3_should allow minimize map.
paid, with, in, Loaded saved skirmish on redmi note 8 has a lot of bugs, but if you start a new skirmish it runs just fine. I hope the icon, tabs or windows around the screen can be minimized or resized and the multiple selection box can be execute using one finger. I still love the game though, best paid app with no in game purchases and can be played offline. 4.5/5
Add, on, packs, Add on packs weren't downloading before but its working now. Amazing port. Hoping we get Dawn of War aswell as CoH 2. Thankyou.

playing, on, a50, Good overall, playing on a a50 a larger screen would be better
used, to, version, Touch controls are weird for someone who's used to the desktop version, but this is a solid port of the original.

found, on, phone, Great classic Not as good as it was on PC but a good game the best I've found on a phone that's for sure!
plays, on, Note, Game is great but plays better on Samsung Note 10+ than Note 20 ultra even with 60hz mode enabled. I don't recommend it for Note 20 ultra users. It's to laggy with very low fps. *For European Note devices*

start, from, point, I like this game but it keeps crashing. id give it 4 or 5 stars but crashing sucks and makes me start over from a far point back
run, on, v60, Love this game!!! Touch controls could use a refine BUT over all it's great, if this can run this good on a lg v60 can it be ported to the switch? Would mind paying for it again, have it on my pc too.

optimized, on, phone, I love CoH when it is out in Android I want to try it but sadly it not what I expected. Controls are lousy whenever I want to pick a unit most of the time it failed to detect my touch. Also the game is not optimized on my phone although I am using OnePlus 7T with Snapdragon 855+ processor that is so powerful but I am still experiencing stuttering and lag. I need a refund for a half baked port.

had, on, games, Disappointed. Installed and was excited. Now when I open this up it says my device isn't supported and ill experience problems (had thus on other games recently and not sure why) I have a Galaxy note 10+ so I don't get what the issue would be here. Ive 3 stared things as i can't really rate anything having never been able to play the game. Whats the issue please? *edit*The problem persisting with your game not being supported on my device? Thanks for the pointless return, ill happily 1 star now

used, to, them, Finally a proper game. Love it. Controls are not that big a deal. Just need to get used to them. But a proper game not a make money scam. Worth it.
get, for, mobile, This is a phenominal adaptation. Only issue is the zoom levels on a 4:3 a screen. But im probably an edge caae here. LG dualscreen. UI kinda loads first, then sticks to how it loaded even if the display changes. But yeah. Controls are as good as youd get for mobile. I enabled double tap to move cause i kept fat thumbing movements, so some options like that...
used, to, controls, Classic. Takes a bit to get used to controls for mobile. But not too bad.
playing, on, pc, Love this game so much when playing on the pc .. now i got this game on my phone.. super happy that i can bring any where... Control can be abit hard.. hope it will be more optimised in the future.... üëçüèΩ

heard, of, this, Great to revisit this game now. Had to adapt my playstyle for the small touch screen but all the same features and gameplay mechanics are there. I only heard of this on its release dat and couldn't believe you could get this on a smartphone , thought I was being trolled üòÇ

control, over, time, Awesome game. The controls are a bit finicky, but still very intuitive, and gets easier to control over time.
let, by, controls, Promised so much but really let down by controls. Insanely frustrating on mobile. Units don't select properly, squads keep getting mixed up, so difficult to choose waypoints or pick up weapons etc. Also INSANELY difficult on normal. Population cap a real pain. Ughhh plz sort it all out. As I said it promises so much so here's hoping.
Played, on, pc, Great game. Played on pc years ago!!!!
ported, to, mobile, Best phone game ever. One of my favorite PC games, surprisingly well ported to mobile. Still a bit fidgety - lots of tapping and dragging to do - but that's RTS for you. Tactical pause is a lifesaver.
Loved, on, pc, Amazing game. Loved it on pc, but never have the time to sit down anymore. Any idea on when the expansions will be added? And/or CoH2???
Tried, over, wifi, So far its a great game just currebtly unable to download the rest of the missions. It just non stop loads but doesn't actually download. Tried over wifi and data and its just stuck so paid $15 for first mission to be stuck. Update: Issue since ahs been resolved.

Play, with, Pen, Glad to See this game Ported. Finally a game you can Play with the S. Pen. Nice Touch Devs! Bet that wasn't easy. worth the Price tag.
wait, for, Tales, Great game can't wait for Tales of Valors and all the expansions for this game üëè
play, on, tablet, Cool game/concept but the in depth, minute controls are so complicated and layered that fun realistic game play is non existent. If you could play on a tablet the size of a 50" TV then maybe it would be worth the price tag. But on mobile using a phone, not worth it
brought, on, mobile, I love how they brought over the pc game on mobile, I'm looking forward to COH2 in the future

crashes, on, Pixel, It crashes a lot on a Pixel 2 and doesn't include expansions but hey, it's a fun game so it's worth it?
play, with, controls, Great game that's impossible to play with current controls, Try making one group of soldiers move only to accidently select another group or cause movement orders that weren't intended. Until they improve the controls it isn't worth the money.
coming, to, mobile, One of my best rts experience coming to mobile. I love it and it runs great. Sure, controls aren't on par with those on PC, but still has me hooked. Thumbs up for the great work !

asking, for, refund, It's a great game but oh man the crashes are sending me insane. I'm at the point of asking for a refund. Pixel 4 XL. Crashes on menus, crashes in the game. Getting ridiculous.

takes, to, side, The game its really good but it has some problems we're the screen takes me to the other side of the map and it gets annoying its probably because i use a Samsung s20 seens it gave me that warning that I may experience a bad performance because of my device . it would be awesome if you guys could fix that :).

loved, in, PC, I'll give 5 star when multiplayer and other factions are added. Great game nonetheless ,loved it in PC as well as Android ü§ü

like, for, skirmishes, So far so good. One of my favourite PC games & the transition to mobile is great so thankyou for that. Only concerns are that it's very limited, & for skirmishes I'd like a ranking system & other factions where at the moment we stay level 1 corporal & can only play the Yanks & Germans. Multi player would be great too & a ranking system for that too with leaderboards & buddy up system. I know it'll be a lot of work but this could go from a good game to one of the very best for mobile.

dealing, with, icons, Game is good, but the amount of micro in this game is difficult with a touch screen. Between the not entirely intuitive controls, and the inability to be precise when there are multiple units close to each other, things can be a little frustrating. Especially when you're trying to get one unit to face a certain direction but you don't realize you still have the last unit selected and now both are moving. I'd said this is especially an issue when dealing with the grouping icons on the right.
control, in, game, cant control my troops in the game and can't minimize command control boxes in the screen it totally block the screen and its hard to control the troops. My phone is Xiaomi BlackShark 1

used, for, owls, Finally! Awesome game, controls takes a bit of getting used to for us old pc owls. But worth every penny.
Paid, for, game, Paid for the game and it doesn't run correctly on the surface duo aspect ratio. The sides of the screen is cut off making the buttons unreachable and unplayable

look, around, map, Game is well designed and love the graphics. However getting squads set up and then selecting the proper ones is a little finicky, there are times I want to look around the map and the squad moves to the area I pressed or the option wheel comes up. Besides that only one crash so far lol. If they update and fix a few things this game could easily be a 5 star game. If you like RTS games, this is the one for you.

Works, on, galaxy, Works great on galaxy note 10 plus
used, to, controls, I got one question, will the Brits and panzer elite be added, if they will be added. One problem is this the AI is way tougher than PC, I don't know if it's me not used to the new controls or something. Other than that, I have enjoyed every second of it
use, during, gameplay, Great to see a proper Rts game on mobile...love it, my only real concern is menu's can use up a lot of space during gameplay and on a mobile device screensize is not great..so would like to see less clutter to see battlefield more...but other than that...fantastic

comes, to, series, By far one of the best RTS games on PC. Absolutely beautiful port. I prefer company of heroes 2 when it comes to the series. But on a mobile device? Nothing here can compete. 10/10 keep up the great work devs.
crash, After, update, After new update,the app always crash before start game screen,i use pixel 2xl,please fix

trim, on, it, You just keep porting these beautiful strategy games you great people. You could make the ui size adjustable and trim some of the bulk on it to fit smaller phone
enjoy, for, mobile, Money well spent. Keep up the good work I've bought 4 of your games now all the Total Wars and this. I really enjoy these for mobile.
reminds, of, game, Controls are decent im sure it takes getting used to. It reminds me of the PC game that I absolutely enjoyed. If I can get to mastering the controls I might come back and give this a 5.
Playing, on, smartphone, Would be nice if it was available on newest tablets... Let's say Galaxy Tab s7 plus... Right? I mean... Playing this game on smartphone is ok but COME ON! You own top model and game is not supported there. FFS
made, on, PC, One of the best RTS games ever made on PC. Unfortunately I've found in the mobile version of the game, the AI cheats. I've had skirmish games in which I have taken every fuel point on the map early game only for my opponent to spawn 6 heavy tanks in the time it takes me to make 1. This renders the whole point of securing points and tactical holding redundant. You might as well just build an army as fast as you can and rush. Forget tactics.

I've had skirmish games in which I have taken every fuel point on the map early game only for my opponent to spawn 6 heavy tanks in the time it takes me to make 1. This renders the whole point of securing points and tactical holding redundant. You might as well just build an army as fast as you can and rush. Forget tactics.

picked, on, mobile, This game was soo much fun on console, just picked it up on mobile today and already having a great time enjoying it all over again
wasted, on, game, Its real!!! I couldn't believe it at first I thought it was a scam but it turns out it's the full game. I have wasted so much of my teenage years on this game and now I can do it through my phone as an adult.

seen, on, steam, Iv seen this game on steam and iv never played it until i got it on the phone its pretty good so far for a mobile port.

add, to, mode, I'm redoing my review and giving 5 stars!! I finished the campaign and im so sad there's no more mission's.. Please add more to the campaign mode.. Other then that the game was awesome!
added, in, future, A faithful port of the original, many hours of fun to be had. Controls take a bit of getting used to, but there is a full tutorial to get you started. Just the vanilla setup for now, would love to see the expansions, extra campaigns, units and factions from PC added in the future!
wait, for, expansions, Apart from confusion from double clicks, triple clicks, double fingers, triple fingers, it's all good. Can't wait for the expansions!
lacks, in, pc, its good port for android üëåüëå but it lacks some details like in pc but over all its excellent port nice one devs üëåüëå
changed, from, version, So, it's a great port. But I have one concern... The minimaps and camera angles are changed from the PC version. It's very disorienting when you're used to the original. Not sure why Feral did that... I'll happily update to five stars if this can be fixed. Right now it's fun, but it's hard coming from PC as a veteran CoH player due to the view default changes.

play, on, mobile, It's always my favourite game. I can't believe it's possible to play it on mobile. Graphic and controls are great. Nostalgy. But one thing is missing: multiplayer. It's planned in future? Thanks.

go, to, download, After downloading the game its asking me now to download the maps, missions, and models. Not sure why that isnt in the download in the first place but thats not even the problem. When i go to download said downloads its telling me i need to use WiFi because of the size but i can continue using normal data and it presents me with the options cancel or retry there is no continue and if i hit retry it just crashes the game and tells me i can send an error report. I dont have wifi.

dlc, in, future, I cant believe my phone is running this. I own a note 10 but still. Theres so many moving parts and they all work so well. Tiny little user interfaces could be improved. Maybe letting us zoom further out would help. This game needs more traction and i hope it does well! Im Looking forward to dlc in the future!
come, because, types, This is an exceptionally amazing jaw dropping experience. To be honest I never thought my favourite game of all time would ever come to android because of all the different hardware types on the platform. But Feral really are the best at what they do. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+ and I have absolutely no problems running the game even with rain falling and artillery bursting. Well worth the money. Hopefully they get enough sales to add on the Expansion Packs. Thank you Feral.

waiting, for, question, Awesome..Was waiting for this One question...I am changing my phone and when I install this game there, my current purchase will be valid Right?
Needs, for, game, Needs PVP but good for a solo game to pass time.
wanted, on, store, Finally I've wanted a game like this on the app store for so long
see, In, version, Great port, as always from Feral, huge fan of Rome too. Just a few questions Why was the gore removed? In the PC version, you see limbs go missing after artillery hits and bodys stay a bit. Here they only exist in wounded state and instantly disappear, if they are killed. And why do we have DLC maps, which feature other factions in the loading screen, for example brits, but we are unable to play them? Why are we unable to change the faction of players and restricted to only switch sides?

play, through, tutorial, Finally a true, fully featured RTS on Android. And not only that, but one of the all time great RTS games. The controls are fairly intuitive, but be sure to play through the tutorial. The game looks good and performs well on my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Highly recommend for RTS/strategy game fans. Support worthwhile premium games! Feral Interactive has done fantastic work for years.

own, on, phone, Some things need to be polished but well done quality on my phone üòçüòç unbelievable I own the second game on my pc all we need now men of war Assault Squad 2 on my phone
get, at, times, One of the best pc ports, but the controls can get whacky at times.
spent, on, game, I've spent thousands of hours on this game on PC. The mods for it on PC are amazing. Mobile version is just as great and brings back a lot of nostalgia. Its is very easy to control and mirco your units around. I'm hoping the DLC factions of Britian and the Panzer Elite get added soon and then multi-player. Not many graphical issues or game play bugs. The major one is Wehrmacht Tank traps don't stop tanks. The Tiger Tank and Wolverine can drive right over them.

Loved, on, desktop, Loved it on desktop. Lots of fun on mobile.
plays, on, phone, One of my top 5 best games. Absolutely love CoH. It plays really well on my Rog phone 2. No issues, I use the pause button quite a bit to prep my strategies and give myself time to adjust my plans. May be a bit of a cheat not sure but I'm not the biggest mastermind at strategy games. No faults, no issues. Great fun with a great story. Spent hours playing it on steam and I'll spend hours playing it here. Hoping to see the rest of the dlc packs to pop up like tales of valor!

came, About, time, About time it came out for mobile. Loved this game for pc and long waited for it to finally get to mobile and its pretty much the same. Just got to get used to the controls. Sometimes selected do not finish the motions can get a little frustrating but again its mobile and not pc. If they would add external controller option it would feel a lot better and might respond to commands. Needs a bit more work but still great.

used, on, screens, Controls take some getting used to on regular phone screens because it's a little congested. A tablet would be ideal. But once I got them down, great game and amazing port to mobile. Cant stop playing. Seriously, I think my wife left me and I'm pretty sure my dog starved to death. Oh well, gotta fight zee Germans!

Love, in, pc, Love this game in pc and much love on Android S8. Internet is not needed all the time so I can play without interruption within traveling. I need other dlc and most importantly other 2 fractions as soon as possible.

playing, after, missions, Complicated controls which don't work well. Stopped playing after 2 missions...
coming, to, mobile, CoH has always been one of my favorite rts games, but felt skeptical when I heard it was coming to mobile. From an initial glance, CoH works quite well. The game features stunning mobile graphics in addition to intuitive ui and camera control. While it is true the ui works well enough, the hud commands an overwhelming part of the screen. Troop management is another issue I think works well, but still has its issues that could be addressed. I also have not been able to download the dlc maps.

improve, like, nation, It is good and smooth to play but it still need to improve like more nation to use.

waited, for, game, I've waited a long time for an RTS game like this. Definitely one of the best. It reminds me of a PC game called Rush for Berlin that I used to play a long time ago. You have alot of control over your squads. The game play and graphics are great, and so is the storyline. Great job developers!

runs, with, issues, Its basically the desktop game on mobile. I have the note20 5g so it runs great with no issues performance-wise. I have however had issues playing as the whermacht. Sometimes when using the defensive doctrine, I am unable to use the rocket barrage ability. Developers if you see this I would be happy to send you video evidence so this bug can be fixed. Other than this I haven't had any issues with this game. I give this 9/10 due to the occasionally touch controls being buggy, but this is rare.

work, on, S6, Great game, no questions asked. Played originals on PC, was hoping it would work on my Samsung Tab S6 but it isn't compatible yet! Please fix, otherwise great job!
used, to, screen, Very good takes a while to get used to the small screen. However still get the excitement of the great PC game on Android
compare, to, iphone, Low quality compare to iphone. Iphone 60fps with HD textures..android 30fps with muddy texture and we're paying the same price as iOS. Gameplay just as good as the PC version minus the multiplayer

releasing, on, mobile, The best WW2 RTS game on mobile! Only complaint is it needs a feature that allows adjusting pan and move sensitivity speed. The game it self is the same game most of us know and love. Thank for releasing on mobile!
play, as, factions, Really fun too bad you can only play as the two factions either way still an enjoyable experience since I never got to play on pc.

Looks, on, android, This franchise is my favorite RTS game. Looks good on android and runs pretty smooth so far. Graphics and audio is pretty good too. I used to play this all the time on pc so I'm familiar with the game. They did a good job moving it over to the mobile platform.

ay, for, years, Amazing rts for android.Thanks for porting this been wanting to ay this for years. Don't have a pc tho. Next please do Switch port!!
given, to, mobile, The best rts given the best port to mobile
expected, from, original, Great game, as was expected from the original. Am a big supporter of the franchise and frequently play COH2. Will multilayer be released? As that was the main reason for purchasing
sit, on, tank, This game is awesome, the story is great ,the tanks sound and looks cool. I would suggest a update allowing one squad to sit on a Sherman tank that would look awesome, I know a machine gun can be put on the tank but having extra guns on it wouldn't hurt .

supported, on, web, Fantastic game ...works ok but not sure why it say that my phone what is Samsung s8 in not supported by game when on ferals web in on list of phone
encountered, into, game, A fantastic port of one of my favourite PC games, have not encountered any issues 3 hours into the game, controls are pretty good having made the jump from keyboard and mouse to a touchscreen, but it does take a short while to get used to. On my OnePlus 7 Pro the performance is really great, FPS is steady and the unit models look phenomenal. The only reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is because my phone model isn't officially supported despite the regular OnePlus 7 being listed as a supported device

runs, on, pocofone, Marvelous port. It runs brilliant on pocofone f2 pro. There's literally nothing on the mobile market at the moment that can compete with this at the moment.

ported, on, Android, My favourite game ported on Android. I'm ecstatic.
playing, on, way, This is insane! I remember playing this on some crappy gateway pc way back and now it's on my freakin phone! Plays well and looks great, no physics but textures are fantastic.
waiting, for, game, This game is awesome!!! I've been waiting for a game like command and conquer to come onto phones, and this is finally it!! If you're a C&C fan, you have to have this!! I love it!

tap, on, Pixel, Overpriced and extremely buggy. I can't tap the menu button on top right corner on my rounded Pixel 3 screen and the game crashes constantly. Please improve the controls and do some debugging. If they fix that, this game is exactly what you would expect. The same good company of heroes from the PC, but ported to mobile.

play, for, everyone, CoHv is a classic RTS. It's a must-have and must-play for everyone that sees themselves as a strategy enthousiast. Yes, the controls aren't optimal, but then you should play on your computer. I think it's amazing you can play this on a phone.

download, over, g., Please allow 4g download without crashing. Great game, I can't download contents over 4g.
play, on, phone, I would love to play this game on my phone, however, Galaxy Fold is not supported well. I encountered overlapping screens at the bottom which led to my loss due to inability to access the upgrade base icon when playing skirmish.

having, during, firefights, Good game, I remember the original pc game having alot more effects during firefights but never the less a very good port. Only thing that bothers me is the fact that there is no graphic options which is pretty commonplace with mobile games now especially a premium paid only game. And it looks like they lock cutacenes to 24fps because they are laggy as heck even on my s20 ultra , but the game runs great besides that. Also seems like they toned the gore down for the mobile port.

playing, on, PC, Have been playing this game on PC a long time ago and it was fun to play it again. The controls are not great, it would be great if you could have played it with a controller like xbox or Ipega. Game crash when I try to download the additional pack in game.

played, on, PC, Just as I entered the main screen it was so nostalgic since I played this game on the PC ever since it was released. And I'm shocked at the fact that this game which I played almost my entire life is on a mobile device

did, for, game, Overall an amazing experience. Great port. Feral did a great job for a fantastic game. My minor gripes are sometimes the controls are a little touchy and awkward to use, and the $15 price for a 15 year old game without the expansions. But if you're a COH, WW2, or RTS fan, this is a must own!
throwing, at, screen, I'm throwing money at the screen but Opposing Fronts haven't shown up yet.. All in all a fantastic game. They haven't changed anything in the base game, its the pc game with controls made for mobile. The buttons can be a bit small though, I recommend playing with some sort of stylus like the S Pen of a Galaxy Note. Looking forward to Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor being ported to mobile in the future aswell.

played, on, app, Barely played a half hour on the app. But I've played this since release on pc and still play it now. Thank you so much for putting my favorite game since I was a teenager onto my phone

come, to, mobile, I waited for this game to come to mobile for a long time now and I'm not disappointed. Run smoothly at most parts on my Note 10+. However, control is a bit still clunky and cutscenes fidelity is a bit low, I think a setting for higher quality can be beneficial here. And strangely, I get a popup saying my phone is not supported, which is obviously not true. Please look into that issue! Those aside, this is a good on-the-go RTS title for both newcomers and CoH fans.

works, on, A3, Fantastic port works well on Xiaomi Mi A3. True to the original game and good adaptation of touchscreen controls. Multiplayer support would have been the icing on the cake. Great work.
spend, in, game, Basically the same as the pc version of the game except on low graffics, with only 2 nations you can be, and no multiplayer (except ai skirmish matches). Overall pretty fun game, especially if you have no internet or limited data, you can spend awhile in this game.
play, in, mix, It's really amazing game play ,details, graphics, everything I play game in mi mix 2 without lag and bug

played, in, time, Haven't played this game in a long time but the fact that they got this down on a mobile and it feels just like pc but on your phone with touch controls is awesome If they can't add MPLAYER they should atleast add that survival mode where its you and 3 others defending your base against waves of enemys that should be doable atleast devs I hope you read this and add it.

love, on, pc, The game continues to crash everytime I attempt to download skrimish modes. I love this game on pc and will change my rating once the developers fix the issue.
playing, since, 2006, Amazing so far. I've been playing since 2006 and its exactly like the pc version. Haven't found a single difference yet. I seriously recommend using a mouse of you can obviously though. Buy it!!!!!
screwed, on, Fold, Great game, but the control layout is screwed up on the Galaxy Fold, the bottom menu and the top resource menu overlaps and covered up each other.
runs, on, galaxy, Pretty cool Even though my device isnt offically supported it runs good on my samsung galaxy A71. 2 issues 1) There doesnt seem to be any online play 2) i downloaded the extras but how do i enable the hd textures? Is it automatically applied?
bring, to, xD, Thank you, please bring more PC games to mobile xD
locks, on, screen, If focus is lost or when switching apps and switching back, game locks up on a black screen. Huawei Note 10, Android 9
expect, from, port, Long time fan of the series! There isnt much different from pc to phone just the controls suck but what do you expect from a pc port to phone. I cant recommend it as a 5 star because the price is steep considering how cheap it is on pc also again controls suck but if you like company of heroes and need to play it on the go buy this game for you phone! Ps not multiplayer so if y I u looking for that it aint gonna happen

come, to, mobile, For an amazing pc game to come to mobile was a fantastic idea really good quality and gamplay I would suggest this to people who love strategy games. But now they have to work on getting company of heros 2 on the market. Cant wait till that happens

come, on, Android, I have waited months for this game to come out on Android. When I went to install it on my Tab S6, Samsung's extremely powerful FLAGSHIP tablet, I was astonished to see that this app is somehow incompatible with my device. I honestly have no idea how that could be possible, as it is far more powerful and faster than the phone I was forced to put it on. I am extremely disappointed.

used, to, tap, A few levels in and enjoying so far, just have to get used to the double tap when setting up weapons teams directions or to de-select. Would like a button somehere to clear selection instead as sometimes the double tap hasn't registered. Worth the ¬£ with down time this will consume when i can't get on a pc or laptop :-)

looking, for, GAME, The WWII GAME I've been looking for ,storylines and graphics are excellent for mobile . The gameplay is not easy but I got help from YouTube videos lol. A bit pricey but overall worth it so far. The cut scenes are great and on the battlefield is awesome. Great game!
see, in, update, Great game,controls are not complicated and graphics are not that terible but NO PVP. I would love too see pvp matches in future update until then my rating is 4 stars.(no crashes on my xiaomi mi 9t runs very smoothly)
reliving, from, relic, Awesome transition from from the best RTS on PC to mobile. Tons of fun, reliving this gem from relic. If you like RTS and have never played CoH, give yourself the opportunity to play one of the best RTS games ever!
thank, for, app, Just like I remember it. I would like to see the dlc's and multiplayer and coop Skirmishes thank you for the app.
plays, on, PC, Lot of fun but as a man who plays alot of it on PC disappointed that the UK and Panzer Elite are not present in this port
runs, on, phone, Very Nice Game I love it. It smoothly runs on my ROG phone 2. Please make more PC platform games for mobiles. Thank u developer team.
zooms, for, scenes, Works perfectly on my OnePlus 8. Surprisingly good touch screen controls for a complex game like this. During actual gameplay the graphics are beautiful. When it zooms in for little cut scenes during missions, character models look a little janky but it's all done in-engine so it's understandable. Overall I'm blown away by the quality of this port. Between this and Dead Cells I'm loving the high quality ports we are finally getting on mobile. Keep em coming guys.

comes, to, phone, One of the best PC games comes to phone. No MP but this is great for skirmish and SP. Looks and feels well. Controls are well done for a phone port. Playing on a Note 9 runs great no lag so far.

remember, on, Pc, It's like I remember it on Pc. I still play CoH2. I can't wait for opposing fronts and Tales of Valor to come to the app. And some multi-player.

plays, like, version, A great experience that plays just like the classic version but the lower graphic fidelity and omission of multiplayer leaves this version just shy of a 5 star review.
runs, without, issue, Game runs without issue on my ASUS ROG Phone 2, solid and stable FPS. Identical to the PC version otherwise, which is really enjoyable! Annoyed that the game requires network every couple of weeks for licence validation, but understand it is to prevent piracy. Still shouldn't be annoying for paying customers like myself though....
