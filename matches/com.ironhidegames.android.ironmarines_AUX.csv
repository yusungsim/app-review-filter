AUX, ATTR, ADJ, NSUBJ, 
is, fun, super, this, Not what I was expecting, but this is super fun. One of the most addictive games I've played. No money no problem you just have to grind 10 times harder, makes it more fun and worth while when you do get items.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game. Wish it had some more missions, but they can be very challenging, which is good and are well designed. Giving 4 stars because of a really really really annoying bug(?) Where it doesn't save what hero you were playing with last time you played so everytime it resets to the default guy and you have to go into the hero menu and reselect when you start the game again. Please fix this. It's not a problem in Kingdom Rush, so I'm not sure why it's a problem here.
is, example, excellent, This, This is an excellent example of an RTS can work on mobile. Excellent.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game it's just that there are too many things for me to focus on but it is still pretty cool and you should try it.
's, fun, great, it, My first mobile RTS other than tower defense and it's great fun.
was, idea, fun, This, This was a fun idea... never do it again lmao
's, game, fun, it, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES AFTER STARCRAFT 😁 so far it's a very fun little game that I can play anytime that I want to, the graphics are certainly good and they're hidden gems it seems on every level (like Jean-Luc Picard hiding in plain sight) I'm not going to give five stars because I only really just started playing... But so far it's a very good game with easy to learn controls and the combat looks good too.

's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game, short battles and a lot of types of units. Little bases to extract minerals and shop new upgrades. Really cheap for a nice experience
is, game, coolest, it, Great game. Stole stuff from Starcraft but it is still the coolest game I have played in ages on a phone. Great work Devs. Give me more.
is, version, fantastic, this, Love the game. RTS is probably my favorite genre and this is a fantastic casual version. Doesn't hurt it looks sort of like Warhammer and Alien with some Starship Troopers vibe.

's, game, epic, It, It's an epic game, I wish we could get some updates though as in new heros and planets to conquer
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but there needs to be a free way to earn more heroes. You only get 3 free ones and the rest are locked behind a paywall. I ended up buying them all myself for a little sale deal but it ended up costing me more than triple the initial game price. At the very least make the heroes cheaper. Only reason I spent so much on a mobile game was because I liked it so much. It doesn't matter if you can beat the game with the free heroes or not. We paid for the game and want the full game.
is, game, fun, This, This is a fun game which I would have to say is the closest I have come to a proper C&C game since EA pulled Red Alert from the store
is, path, responsible, it, Unfortunately, despite charging a premium for this game, the developer also expects some players to spend possibly hundreds of dollars on in-game items. Not only does this needlessly cheapen gameplay, but it is arguably the least morally responsible path for a developer to take. This game is strongly reminiscent of Starcraft, so if that's your bag, and you don't mind the possibility of giving the developer many times over what this game is worth, then you might enjoy it.
's, games, played, it, Great lil RTS, it's one my most played games. But buying new heroes kinda feels empty. Every new hero you buy should unlock more content like their origin story campaigns in their native homeworlds. Along with the comics to tell the lore. Please do not let this game die. Make more content. People are ready to pay for it.
is, filler, great, this, Fun game. If you like command and conquer as a kid this is a great lil filler on an airline flight to play offline. Buy it
was, experience, linear, It, Was really excited for a mobile RTS but at the start you were really limited in what you could do. It was a very linear experience and I didn't want to play for more than an hour
is, fun, much, This, This is so much fun the game play is perfect well worth the buy
is, game, great, This, So... This is a great game and everything, but... is Fate human or empyrean? This is bugging me so much and I can't sleep.
been, game, decent, what, Controls and lack of attack move ruin what could have been a decent game
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game. Wish they would make more for it
's, rts, mobile, it, The path finding can be annoying and the unit selection is tedious but I can't really blame the game cause it's a mobile rts. None the less a very polished and fun game!
been, experience, great, it, Amazing game! so far it has been a great experience. Its challenging enough to keep you trying new ways of completing missions.
is, game, Great, yours, Every gameof yours is Great game, please make kingdom rush legend available on android... People will love it.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. You get to kick alien butt:) only complaint would be the hero cost but I guess that helps fund new games and pay bills.
is, game, worst, It, Someone pls kill me!!?? It is the worst game from Ironhide studios. I love strategy but in this game dexterity is important. Fighting bosses is extremely tedious.
'm, fan, big, I, I'm a big fan of real time strategies like Command & Conquer and for an Android game, this is addictive and challenging. We like!
was, concept, good, It, It was a good concept put in the wrong way. This could have been repayable but this was made linearly
's, game, best, It, Big fan of Iron hide games, but this one is my absolute favourite. It's the best Command n Conquer Red Alert style game I've ever seen. Hope you add more worlds. Would love to hear recommendations of similar games!
is, game, made, This, This is an extremely well made game for such a low price. No ADs, and all upgrades are obtainable without microtransaction. It would be better, if there's some kind of Skirmish mode, to keep the players entertained after completing all missions
is, game, awesome, this, Overall this is awesome strategy game, if you know AoE then you should try. Worth it.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game ! So much potential to become greater with a story and experience upgrade 🤘🏾
's, statecraft, quite, It, Your game is fun and it's game play are very easy. It's not quite statecraft but close.
'm, fan, old, I, The game is hard but you can still win,and so far in my own experience, it's fun to play and of course I'm an old fan of kingdom rush, can't wait to get the achievements
's, starcraft, good, It, It's very good, easy mobile starcraft. Sort of. It's good, use a 10 inch + tablet.

's, starcraft, mobile, It, It's very good, easy mobile starcraft. Sort of. It's good, use a 10 inch + tablet.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game just at the end mission it's very hard and it's annoying cuz you don't basically what I'm saying is the creature in the last mission and annihilate everything annihilate turrets into hits that's kind of annoying in the Marines they don't do anything to them
is, RTS, fun, It, It is a basic yet fun little RTS that combines basic base building in the form of capture points with tower defense elements and spawn able units, as well as heroes you can call to the field during missions. I don't want to say much more as to not spoil anything, so check out this well made game and have fun playing a legitimately fun mobile RTS, it is worth at least one full playthrough.

's, game, latest, It, It's my latest favorite game. Just enough story with hilarious elements added. I gladly paid for all the heroes, just to have the fun characters to explore. Great worlds. Well done!

be, tower, casual, this, I thought that this would be the casual tower deffinatly game but in fact it's a bit of that plus a bunch of extra stuff. It's to hard to explain but it's not what you think!
is, game, mobile, this, And this is a mobile phone game!?! Absolutely amazing!!
's, behavior, most, that, No! Absolutey not! I paid MONEY for this game and it only comes with 3 characters? And there's no in-game way to unlock the other ones you have to pay MORE money for them? It's games like this that give the mobile gaming industry a bad name. The style looked cool but I didn't even get to the gameplay. Don't act like you're a "premium" game and then lock content behind additional microtransactions, that's the most garbage behavior and completely unforgivable. The devs should be ashamed.

's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game! The style of this company fits this type of game so perfectly. My only real complaint is that it seems to eat away at my battery life. I played one level. I started at 90% and finished at 76%
's, game, solid, it, Decent. A game you pay up front for shouldn't have microtransactions. Other than that it's a solid game
is, game, ultimate, This, This is probably the ultimate defense game! Superb UI. Love the "story" woven through the missions in each world. The three free heroes do the task well, but I'm hoping that there would be the option to purchase the other heroes by credits. Nonetheless, this is worth purchasing for. 🙂
's, game, paid, It, It's a paid game, WITH microtransaction. You get a couple of heroes, but have to pay $50 for the rest.
's, game, full, It, It's a full rather complete game. Pretty fun, honestly more than I was expecting. I really enjoy it and recommend it.

's, world, wonderful, it, Buy the plane, win the game. This is some of my favorite space sci-fi since starship troopers and starcraft. With the exception of a few overtuned bosses (the tyrant) the game's difficulty is very entertaining. You'll fight hard for every inch and it's a wonderful little world. I wish there was more content. Maybe some choke point survival.

's, game, bad, It, It's not a bad game, in the same vein as the others but instead of parodying tropes like fantasy and pirates iron marines seems to have simply used the entirety of StarCraft for most of its inspiration. There is also a bigger sin here where 3/4 of the heroes are behind a paywall. I already paid for your game. I refuse to pay 2-3x more for different ways to describe "move here and attack."
's, fun, much, It, It's so much fun i like this game and many heroes and many troops this is my favorite.😀😀😀😀
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. Wish I didn't have to grind so much but otherwise great
's, RTS, constructed, It, This is more than just a tower defense game. It's a beautifully constructed RTS, and it's worth it. Seriously, awesome mobile game.
is, type, exact, This, This is the exact type of mobile game I was looking for. Even though they use the capture business model, the art, music and game design are really good.
is, app, premium, This, Read my entire post, gamers. I grabbed this through Play Pass, and it removes the need to buy the extra heroes... However, this is not a justification or reason for you to subscribe to Play Pass. This is a premium app, and you should get everything when you pay for it. Google should force that. You wouldn't buy a car without its motor, so why buy a game without all its content? Great game, too much greed. 1 star. Let's review bomb developers who do this. Google: Implement some quality control.
be, heir, apparent, this, I'm a little concerned about the depth of this game along with the ease of use in dealing with multiple units. Having said that, this could be (FINALLY) the C&C heir apparent for mobile! There is a lot to love about this game, I even love the music. I normally turn off music & sfx 1st thing in games but not this one. There's too much to mention about what I like & even more about suggestions but TRY IT if you like RTS! Love to see multiple unit groups & unit specific commands like guard & such!
is, game, good, this, I think this is a good game could do with more mission and story lines
