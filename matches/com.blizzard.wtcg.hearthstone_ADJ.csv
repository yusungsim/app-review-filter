NOUN, ADJ, 
frames, low, This game is awesome, ranked is awesome and battlegrounds is the best, being able to play with all four of my brothers is amazing. Although I do get low frames and quite a bit of lag and sometimes get disconnected BUT that's probably just because I'm playing on a phone
game, good, Pretty good game
game, Good, Good game
experience, Terrible, Terrible multiplayer experience
update, recent, Am unable to open the game after a recent update. Tried reinstalling but stuck on pending. Been playing for 5 years but i guess this is the end.
part, worst, The worst part about this game is all the sore loses who quit the game. Penalize players who just leave the game without finishing it the proper way.

card, great, I loved the concept, gameplay, and rewards; what a great card game. But I gave up after realizing how unfair the matches are. I'm a newbie player getting matched with veteran players who have nothing but legendaries. It is too infuriating for me to continue.

community, dead, Game doesn't work and when it does you can't find a game, dead community not worth dowloading, no one does basic pvp anymore. sometime you get stuck on a finding match screen which means you have to re install the entire game cause it's a bug that persists after it happens then 1st time, basically a waste of data to download, Activision Blizzard really don't care anymore, unless your willing to pay for their attention all their games are bugged or broken, and they still put Micros above fixes.

review, Updated, Updated review: I had it one star for a while when they let op cards fester for so long in both standard and wild, but I'm general they seem to be making a concerted effort to try and balance the game. Pretty good. Occupies your time well.

platforms, other, This game sucks on Android it will rob you of your rating by freezing up or kicking you out of the game or just plain not connecting you to a game once you're locked in,thus shooting down your rating I hear this game doesn't have these problems on other platforms just people on Android they don't seem to give a f*** about at least not enough to attempt to fix the problems....

Garbage, passable, Honestly was looking forward to playing this on a tablet but it may be mildly passable game Garbage
cards, more, Been playing since March of 2014 and really enjoy the game. It's gotten a lot easier for new and free to play players with the reward track giving you more cards and other rewards. Just because you can't reach legend doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game! Additionally connection is fine so I don't know what the problem is for other people. Makes me feel like the Connection problem is on their end.

duels, heroic, The game is severely unbalanced... no matter how good you are or what cards you have, you will lose way more than win. I don't even play heroic duels anymore because the game influences whether or not you get to progress mainly because it controls which cards you get to pick from along with the passive powers...an addicting and equally frustrating game all around...I really don't know if this game is worth it anymore.

tone, serious, Has become too RNG-based lately. Also it has a lot of grind and money cost associated, it'not de facto free to play at all. Card art is cartoony and got censored from a more serious tone. Has one of the worst achievemebt system and battlepasses of any game. Also trying to force various gamemodes and bloating the app to make it unresponsive.

modes, many, Loved it back in the days but now too many modes, skins, characters needs to be paid to get it and turned into a pay to win game.
term, long, The game is really good and fun but the problem is 49 in 50 times the game doesnt even start . It is really annoying. To prevent this problem blizzard doesnt do anything because the problem is ongoing from like 2018. And if you uninstall the game it doesnt help long term.

game, good, EDIT: (4*->5*) Glad to now be able to recommend this as a good not 100% pay-to-win game. I was originally hesitant about the new game modes, worrying that overexpaning the game would cause the quality to suffer. But actually, the modes are new avenues for free game play for both solo and PvP. They're pretty fun and well thought out. Great game. 👍

game, classic, It's fuggin Hearthstone man, nuff said. Super happy with Blizzard's Decision to make it a gaming platform instead of just the classic game.
killer, great, very fun and i great time killer
decks, own, Used to give hearthstone 5 stars but the truth is, hearthstone is massively pay to win. If you arent prepared to dump a lot of money into this app don't think you'll get anywhere. Even if you are just starting out and think you stand a chance, trust me you don't. You can try make your own decks but if you don't have the meta cards you'll never get anywhere.

expansion, next, I know this game is pay to win. But i figure it out by saving at least 1000 g for next expansion. And if lucky enough to get legendary we can still play deck around that .
game, larger, Although it's a larger game gb wise it's fun with lots of play modes and the in game currency is plentiful enough you feel like you don't really need to spend money. Without hearthstone there probably would never have been mtga. Props for all the work put into this product.
app, good, It's a good app, however I'd add more time at the end of the battleground battle. Never have I ever had enough time to finish my round if it's only two of us fighting.

time, long, Two issues: -The app is so heavy. Takes a long time to load, has slowdowns, and drains the battery. -Everytime internet connection is lost, even for a second, the app is 'closed'. Super annoying combined with my first issue. Also, why does solo play require internet?? Other than those, it's fun.

solitaire, high, 12.2.21 Update: They still don't playtest their game. The meta is the worst it's been and its high roll solitaire. Wild was once an escape but now its also devolved with questlines. Patches are as slow as they've ever been. Every expansion is a rotating wheel of a month of OP unplaytested meta, misguided patches based off whatever data they acquire and then next expansion anticipation. So there's seemingly never a good time to disenchant or commit to a deck at risk of it being bad or nerfed.

year, first, Game use to be good when first came out first year or two was good. Then all these expansions came out and cards just showed those who paid to win can tell when battling and those who had to grind. Pretty much all about opening packs and buying new expansions every few months I stopped playing after pouring 4 years at least to this. Just wasn't fun for me anymore

game, actual, The actual game itself 100/5 stars You should play it on on PC. The app version. Is hot garbage, how is it that blizzard? A successful multi million dollar company. Can't make a stable mobile CARD GAME. Imagine playing ranked or battlegrounds. Then all of a sudden you disconnect (causing you to lose the game). There is no other frustrating experience. I thought it was just hardware and my phone was just old. Nope! When I upgraded, the same problems persisted. Go play Yu-Gi-Oh duel links 🙃

GAME, stable, The actual game itself 100/5 stars You should play it on on PC. The app version. Is hot garbage, how is it that blizzard? A successful multi million dollar company.

network, poor, Great... Apparently update problem was not the games fault but rather my poor network.. back to 5 stars, because it really is a awesome game!!!!!! Try it if you don't believe me... And as far as everyone complaining that it's a pay to win game and everything.. try putting more time toward playing and advancing .. I believe it's quite far to all

game, actual, I refuse to play the actual hearthstone card game since it's the most p2p phone app I've ever played (blizzard what did I expect) that being said battlegrounds is alot of fun and the addition of mercs is pretty cool

tgc, best, Was best tgc years ago, now is just trash...
player, paying, If your not a paying player... dont play this game. The hearthstone algorythm sucks if you dony have every card. Even if your a golden player as i am. The game seems to block you from winning unless you pay. Trust me... i have paid alot on this game yo not be able to get anywhere. Even with the best decks you will be subjected to lose before you start the match in ranked play..... if i could rate this game a ZERO! I WOULD !!!

money, much, Need to Tier players depending on how much money theyve spent on the game, you have silver 5 players with 80% legendaries in their deck. How does that even work...
game, Great, Great game, always good updates
updates, good, Great game, always good updates
game, fun, A fun game, but expensive for new players. Needs many general bug fixes, currently battlegrounds freezes on android whenever I try and start (nothing shows at character selection) and I end up having to fully restart, missing round 1/2. Still an issue 2 weeks later.

classes, other, Priest is way unbalanced and overpowered. Makes wanting to play any other classes unfun and makes the game totally unfair when I still have 30 health and the priest pulls out their shard to insta-kill my hero directly. Total bs. How can you make a card or even a combo that does that. It's not like they are putting a zodia God card together. They literally only have maybe 3 steps in the game to wipe you out. In my mind I'm like, "well obviously you should play a priest then." But no, I'm not. Bs.

update, latest, So with the latest update the app keeps flipping back and forth saying it needs to update and open the app. I did update, but it keeps saying it needs to be updated.
patch, previous, From the previous patch I can't play multiplayer on battlegrounds and sometimes it freezes in the lobby plus fix these.And it takes to long to restart the game.i just lost 300 PTS because the game doesn't boot
harassers, serial, the game is inconsistent in quality and excitement, especially for the price they ask. However the app is very well maintained. unfortunately the developers are allegedly serial sexual harassers and abusers, as detailed in a california lawsuit against the company.

years, past, They've made the game much better for the free to play player the past few years. The auto battler Battlegrounds, and the Duels competitive rogue-like are both free to play marvels and incredibly fun. The main ladder has also been much better balanced than in the past (secret paladin, huntertaker) and I feel like I can build a deck to counter anything that becomes meta. If you've left the game, come back :)

while, long, It's matchmaking has been better as of late doesn't feel like it used to or maybe in just getting better at the game lol. It's worth a play if you like card games with no foreseeable stopping outside blizzard being shut down due to its CEO but outside that I see hearthstone lasting a long while.

complaints, consistent, What is going on with this game? I re-downloaded. I used to play CONSTANTLY and daily and for some reason your game seems to think I'm not connected to the internet when I am. I see consistent complaints of this. Please fix, you have many people who enjoy your game. Please make sure to allow us to actually play it.

apps, other, App is slow and drops connection frequently despite all of my other apps with just fine.
cards, new, Fun Game. Used to be a lot better and I hesitate to open the app anymore because they beg for money with new and unnecessary skin cards to buy..its desperate and annoying.

cards, enough, I've been playing since nearly the start of this game. Having enough cards to make a wide range of decks has never been a problem for me. Even if you are relatively new, you can still earn cards to make versatile decks. However, there are still certain decks you can't beat due to how much players paid real money for it. Despite the number of years I've spent on this game, the biggest challenge are playing against those who spend over $20 to cheese the game. The only real downside in this game.

bruhh, good, Very good game bruhh
player, single, This game is great, been playing it for years and it's still super fun. I barely ever have connection issues and it's only usually in single player mode where I can just jump right back in at a later time. Everyone else is saying that they are getting disconnected every single game but I don't have any of those problems, just very few times. So it might not be blizzards fault so I recoend trying this game out and seeing if you enjoy it and if it'll work for you.

card, online, Best online card game ever (nothing beats MTG in person), it just keeps on getting better and better with each added card. Still the same review 5 years later.

experiences, new, fun game. been around for years but keeps bring new experiences and ways to play. it's fun with lots of collectibles.
problem, only, It's pretty entertaining. The only problem and annoying thing about is you have to update it frequently.

update, Latest, Latest update wont let me log on with mobile data. I do not have any other form of internet. Never spending money on a blizzard product again. What a waste. Update - a year later I can log in, but can't connect to a game. Update 2 - can play now. Yay. Only took almost 2 years. Will never get my money back for the battleground perks during the time I couldn't play though. Blizzard used to be a good company. Not so much anymore.

app, damn, This damn app is updating literally evertytime I open it. Its driving me insane
GWENT, more, Fun game but prices are over the top. My first-ever digital CCG but not my last -- been playing more GWENT and Runeterra instead and brought over my cash there (as both are way F2P friendlier, which in incentivizes me to support the game[s], being a respected and satisfied customer).

time, long, I still play this game, so you may think a 2 star review is harsh. Its a 2 star game because of the bugs they refuse to fix and their inability to fix their meta. I'm a long time player, and I foolishly hold out hope for this game.
game, Great, Great game ive been playing it for years prices are high you can play the game as is and get every card but you would spend all your time doing it however its really fun to play mercenaries a separate game mode is really fun too however to get everything your either putting hours on end worth of time or spending your pay check I play this game all of the time but its a problematic issue when there's decks that combo out turn 5 or 6 kills easy and new players can't compete so they quit playing

pay, much, It's too much pay to play for a free game. Battlegrounds isn't pay to play but duels, which already charges an entry fee DOES require you to pay for cards. When I finally copped out and paid about $40, the game got significantly more fun. Tl;dr overpriced pay to play but a fun game with free elements.

chess, fantastic, The base game is RNG Junk since Dark Moon but Battlegrounds is a fantastic auto chess.
matches, difficult, Love this game its got some really difficult matches.
players, numerous, Quilboars are too OP. Ruin the game play. Also incredibly numerous, 4-7 players all sharing QBoar card pool and still making top 4, 3 or 4 spots. Deleted!

access, limited, Game is very expensive. Yeah, you can still play it for free, but you'd have very limited access to the cards and features.
job, Excellent, Excellent job Blizzard 👏 👍 👌
update, last, Can't enter game after last update. "Thx"...
unplayable, meta, A.I. makes anything outside of meta unplayable. If u make a deck where u need to draw certain cards and you even create a lot of conditions to draw those cards, you won't draw them. The A.I. works against you most of the time in the favour of meta decks. Let the game be diverse, please for the sake of this game's future.

game, last, Game load and says I've been reconnected to my last game. Resuming... And just hangs there indefinitely.
thing, last, All the years and money spent, but the app still so broken. Can't play with friends anymore, so the last pleasent thing about this game has lost too. But keep collecting that money :)

game, Great, Great game but wish I could choose to lower the graphics settings or give the option to run at 60fps
game, Great, Great game with terrible performance. Currently asking to update but the store doesn't have one, so can't play. Disconnects every time it goes to background, take forever to reconnect, and the dialogs only make it worse.

option, only, Can't even play anymore. It tries to update, then says "let's go to the store to do the download" then the only option in the store is "play" which repeats the cycle. Close up shop, Blizz. Start over.
modes, extra, I've played since day one. It's a card game, with extra modes, but none of them are good. Blizzard has recently been investing more and more into "extra" game modes. Updates almost every day, takes at least 10 minutes each. Game crashes frequently, Blizzard can't get their head out of their @$$ to make a game function fairly or at all really. They never balance the real issues, just make more trash for you to spend money on or hate the experience completely.

Updates almost every day, takes at least 10 minutes each. Game crashes frequently, Blizzard can't get their head out of their @$$ to make a game function fairly or at all really. They never balance the real issues, just make more trash for you to spend money on or hate the experience completely.

update, recent, Love the game but most recent update is bugged. Keeps telling me to visit the store to download even though the play store says it's updated
app, mobile, turned out the animations lag on the mobile app to the point when you cannot compete in battleground mode, which makes the mode UNPLAYABLE i change my rating from 4 to 2
bugs, many, So many bugs and crashes. Great game but bad app.

customer, whale, Thousands of dollars. I'm a whale customer
update, Latest, Latest update broke the game. Can't even install fresh from the store.
updates, constant, I've been playing this game on and off for 5 years now, and it's time I stopped to give it the rating it deserves. Are there constant updates? Yes. Are there endless cash pits to drop your money into? Of course. Does any of this ruin the game? Not at all. I see the developers working extremely hard to keep this game exciting and functional on a regular basis. This game is fully playable without having to purchase a single thing, though you will be tempted. Thanks for a great game Blizzard ILY! ♡

game, only, The best strategy game and the only game i ever played for years
upgrades, minor, I don't need an update every 2-3 weeks. Just keep game running and do some minor upgrades
characters, Balanced, I've been playing this game since 2016 and I absolutely love it! Balanced characters and alot of game modes. It's nice when seasons change and having cards rotate in and out so the gameplay and character play style is different.
diamond, high, been playing for about a decade and still love this game. been high diamond / low legend rank for the last few years. For those worried about people calling out bugs, I have never once experienced any. I have a feeling these people simply have very old devices.

system, new, I've been playing for 7 years. I have rarely ever spent money and I have been always fairly high and stayed competitive. The new battlepass system just puts u over the top, will never have to spend a dime ever again lol. And the new core set gives new players like 200 cards after they play the game a little. Would def recommend to anyone.

game, free, Its hard to fault this for a free game. No adverts and the game is really fun, albeit too challenging when you match with someone that's bought better cards. I really like the battlegrounds mode as it levels the playing field. Mercenaries is also a fantastic addition.

update, latest, The latest update was downloaded and installed. I played for a day. Then the app was "verifying" the update. Now it's prompting me to update when there's no update I already have it. It won't let me play...
lot, whole, The game could be a whole lot better.. but it could be much, much worse too. Don't know if this is a good thing or not.

game, fun, It's a fun game but it is a bit laggy on most phones and sometimes it gives you an opponent that is a lot stronger than you and that you can't win if matchmaking was a bit better and if it was a bit less laggy it would be 5 stars

game, worst, This is the worst game in the world. A lot of bugs, i cannot play with my friends, because the button "play" does not work. Battlegrounds is the worst mode in this game. A lot of lags, ultimates cannot work properly, the random is the shittest.

trash, complete, This game and app are complete trash. Never and i repeat never play this game. Go play yugioh, pokemon or magic the gathering in person instead. That would be much less of a waste of your time rather than playing on this turd.
app, difficult, good, would be nice to be able to download it again and play. Will keep trying but it seems to be the most difficult app I have at getting to actually install and perform correctly for any amount of time really

updates, small, Why does this app CONSTANTLY want to do small updates when I'm in the middle of a game and then disconnect me? It does it EVERY time I play. I'm not talking about actual patches, I'm talking about updates that take 5 seconds that should have run when I'm not in game. Highly annoying at this point. This happens no matter what network I'm on (I've tried 4) and happens in every single mode that's a live game against other players. Blizzard, you're decades old, get it together.

week, last, The game wouldn't start last week but it was fixed. This week the game crashes when i play battlegrounds. The hero selection screen sometimes freezes and does not show any heroes. Or the game directly crashes. If i get to play the game, between rounds app crashes again. I cleared the cache but at this point I think I will delete the game.
app, standalone, Hey please make battleground a standalone app.
people, less, I like to thank blizzard for making a game that is huge on phones, has issues with hoe the app is built and ran, crashing 2 seconds before i WIN RANKED MATCHES, PHYSICALLY UNPLAYABLE. Been playing since 2016, and the realization that BLIZZARD DOESNT CARE about 1 player, much less people who have similar issues to this 1 player. WHY DO I EVEN PLAY?? The GAME is FUN (50-50). The HORRIBLE TEAM behind ANY thing that is in this game, like a PATCH that PREVENTS APP START UP. Fix your DESIGN Blizzard.

scam, total, Too expensive, they dilberately power scale the cards every set requiring you to pay at least a hundred dollars minimum. Saying this game is free to play is a total scam as you cannot practically play the game without the money scams and traps. Blizzard is a disgusting company that proudly supports left idealism, and has entirely lost my business as of late. As of right now there is over $400 worth of junk in the hearthstone store. Greedy failing company that needs to fix their priorities.

card, fantastic, it's a fantastic card game, but I cannot stand the updates ... idk what it is with Hearthstone and updates... I am so annoyed by how frequently I have to wait 1hr+ on an update... and the game has single player modes.... so why do I have to be connected to the internet 24/7??? blizzard does not understand how mobile gaming works. I won't even mention the horrible port issues that remain unresolved since it's mobile release.

game, similar, I've had this game for over two weeks and havent been able to play it once. I've updated and updated and everytime I get back on the app to try to actually play the game it tells me I need another update. I'd really love to play but the fact that I downloaded a similar game at the same time and was able to get in and start playing within minutes really disappointing. If I get into the game anytime soon I'll write a proper review.

news, recent, Activision Blizzard portrays itself as a fun and gamer centric company. But recent news shows how capitalistic it is. It has hung its employees out to dry. Reports at Kotaku show that employees were known to share tips to skip meals and use the company's free coffee to quell their appetites while they work overtime. I do not endorse this exploitation. I been playing Hearthstone for a year and now it's in my discard pile. 50 USD a pop for card packs. Packs change every few months. Pay to win.

game, addictive, wow very addictive game
game, Best, Best game in the world
changes, Recent, Hearthstone used to be smooth and clean, rewarding and satisfying to play. Recent changes make it impossible to earn coins to buy packs essentially forcing you to pay money to unlock anything worthwhile at all (which I never will). App sluggish, barely able to scroll in the store on a flagship phone. Bugs and glitches galore, when swapping decks from wild to standard it will show that the deck has changed and you can play then when you're in the queue it suddenly reports that you cant play with a wild deck and it kicks you out despite still showing your deck as standard. Blizzard has lost their touch, the app needs a total rework.

game, best, no matter how much hate this game gets, its the best phone card game out there
game, dumb, What a dumb game. Check out the solo adventurer mode, an impossible to beat stage when the devs set the deck. 2/2 board flood with no way of countering. This game deserves the 1 star.
type, specific, Battlegrounds is broken! Tavern refreshes are anything but random. It seems like the game steers you towards a specific minion type. No longer fun.
problem, idiotic, That idiotic problem about updating the game only by updating it inside the play market.. Plus, when u are connected to Wifi and go outside its coverage the game is not connected via GSM signal..
game, best, best game to play stoned
download, stupid, Every time i launch the game it just crashes. I waited an hour and a half yesterday downloading the stupid 2.1 gig download just for this? Absolutely terrible i only managed to squeeze 1 hour tops of the game in before its unplayable. Blizzard sort it out man its dissapointing how little you guys care.
decks, same, This game is completely rigged. After a certain Rankin it is always the same decks and that only prove there is only one way to win. Always the same deck and strategies that can win. There is no originality and options to have fun when you rise above a certain rank.

suggestion, only, I've been playing hearthstone through the app for a while now and my only suggestion is adding stylus capabilities

update, ready, Downloaded, installed. 2GB update right away. Okay, finished the update, ready to play. Nope, another 2GB update. Didn't wait this one out, somehow I suspect there was another 2GB update right after that. This is not an app for playing, this is an app for waiting.
game, Good, Good game but regular disconnections

job, good, i love the game and its fun and good job on it :)
client, mobile, Blizzard please fix the mobile client otherwise just take it the app out of the shop, what's the point of a game that doesn't work?!
bugs, sound, You guys absolutely have to fix the bug for the master volume isn't respected when you put in headphones or take out headphones. There's been sound bugs in this game from the beginning.
card, single, I have every single card on this game. Fantastic in all aspects, every few weeks there is new content available , after 7 years I am stii playing everyday

base, loyal, This game preys on their loyal customer base. If you want to be competitive spend $80 for some of the game every 3 months. $20 more than a AAA game. Battlegrounds is good though
design, Great, Great design. Getting watered down by the day. With new insanely game changing stuff getting added all the time, the soul of the game is being lost. Meanwhile it is nearly unthinkable to try and keep up with good decks for a season or two as a free-to-play player. Wouldn't recommend to a serious gamer who doesn't have 40+ hours a week of free time to grind.

company, Greedy, Greedy company They started to focus just on the monetization of the game rather on helping the other players get resources to enjoy the game without paying any money. They send daily bundles of packs or skins to tempt you into buying and it's annoying because there is one thing if I search for them and one if I'm attacked with a daily reminder that they want my money and they don't care about the players just their profit. I still like the game and I can't give it 1 star but I don't know.

games, few, very boring after few games, too repetitive
time, long, After upgrading to a Pixel 6 Pro I decided to give this game a chance again after a long time off. Unfortunately it crashes a LOT. I've been trying to open 25 packs that I had left over and it has crashed 5 times just in that, not to mention many in-game crashes.

negativi, dopo, ATTENZIONE! Un giorno solo matchup positivi e il giorno dopo solo negativi in modo da alternare stati di euforia a stati di confusione che "dovrebbero" indurre i più giovani allo shopping compulsivo per migliorare le prestazioni. Un gioco sviluppato con un team di psicologi.

game, same, I can't believe how disappointing this game has become!! I've been playing this game off and on for at least a decade now. This is not the same game it used to be. Absolutely terrible. Blizzard has ruined yet another game! They should be ashamed of themselves!
fix, fold, Horrible for the fold fix NOW

players, New, There's dozens of modes that have been released, and a lot of them are free and do not require a collection to play. New and ftp players can play and compete in these modes to progress on the battle pass, which will earn you gold and packs to progress in the main game. You won't reach standard ranked top 1% as a completely new free player, but you can still maintain a place somewhere on the ladder, while the modes you CAN dominate as a new ftp, bolster your collection over time. Never too late!

game, good, Used to play a lot. It's a good game for casual fun, but you really can't take it seriously. Forget about owning every card without spending couple hundred dollars every three months. Once you know what you're doing you'll win 4-6 out of 10 times. There are lots of interesting decks and combos to try, you'll get through them in a couple years IF you spend a couple thousand dollars. Otherwise enjoy what you can and don't take it seriously.

game, good, Hearthstone is more fun to watch someone else like Kripp play than it is to play yourself. That should say it all for you right there. Hearthstone hasn't been a good game for quite a while but they keep messing it up even more for those of us that just want to play it while on the toilet. They got rid of the mid range meta and started to balance things but then came out with Diablo for Battlegrounds which is absolutely insane. And for other play modes they can't balance things much better!

A point of suggestion regarding "Custom Deck" creations is the Clear option so we can clear a deck of cards instead of needing to delete the whole lot. We also need the ability to aquire gold (5L10W) per match

game, better, Why play this If you can just download Legends of Runeterra? Way better game from a developer who at least acts as if they care about their players...
update, last, Since the last update (beginning of November) I can't open the game. Keeps saying updated needed, failed connection. * Again the same mistake. I won't uninstall the app every time you add an update guys, it's really annoying - 22 of November update*

time, long, I love this game and have been playing for a very long time... like 5-6 years i think. This app however is terrible. It cost me so many attempts at getting legendary that i stopped playing ranked. Moved over to battleground. Now its constantly crashing and costing me rank there. If you play a session without it crashing you are a very lucky person. Terrible app that will cost you games constantly.

issue, irritating, Edit* android version has an irritating issue, where app will update automatically, at random. I tried to log in and wait or play non ranking game or two first to allow update (which disconnect you!) to go, but it's not working. You can play/wait 15 minutes and as soon as you think you are good, update will ruin your ranking game.

release, early, Wanted to put this out there and change my review. This company is trash. I honestly dislike you. For almost 2 years I guarantee I was one of the very few in the beginning to pre register for Diablo Immortal hoping you'd let me play an alpha early release or beta test in some form. I patiently waited for you guys to FINALLY pick me to be apart of the game and you guys never did. You never did. I officially think you're at the top of the worst gaming companies to exist. You guys really just suck

apps, other, App just won't update says I can tab out and use other apps but every time it update again and again and again and Why is this game so difficult to update Mercenaries games that you cannot exit forcing me to finish them.
update, last, After the last update the app broke altogether. I only play Battlegrounds and the game starts but I get nothing but an empty board. Reinstalled the app already once last week - 2Gb of data! - and right want to do it again. Please fix this. Cheers

game, Best, Best game ever
time, same, I much prefer this card game to say the eldor scrolls version but at the same time I would prefer more variety of games that also supply more prizes or some sort. I'm not interested in achievements worth fractions of a card pack at best but something more substantial would be nice

issues, other, I don't hate this, but I don't feel like playing either. It's not good enough to push past all the other issues. I do feel like the game is really good at what it does, what all card games do. But then you ask yourself, why do I want to do card game stuff? They've done so much to spread out the design space but not enough to improve playability of the base game, the main product. They've gotten close sometimes but it all gets thrown away chasing the next new shiny.

time, final, I have played Hearthstone off and on since Beta. I am now to the point I am going to uninstall it for the final time. I have a new phone that can only get it to even load 1/4 of the time. Add to that constant freezing and crashing it is unplayable Also, this used to be a fun and casual game to play. Sure, you would come across serious players, but they weren't the jerks you find now. Unless you are spending $$ you can forget about winning.

ranks, much, Use to be 5 stars but now the connection issues are horrendous.....I lost so much ranks because of disconnect and reconnections...... horrible experience now.

code, new, Every time I switch it to my email to get the verification code, it logs me out. Log back in with code in hand. But it sends a new code. Unable to resolve without a pc login or alternative email access. Basically, I cant log in so I cant play.

game, Best, Best card game I have played. For The Horde!!!
years, few, i used to play this a few years back, and it was very good. now the game has TOO many bugs, and it freezes up and disconnects every minute. its hard to play when you literally cant play. hopefully this stuff gets fixed :)

card, main, Used to be a 5 star game, switched to LoR as my main card game Way less money hungry Open it up from time to time for the auto chess, that is well done, so 2 stars instead of 1 Sorry but you ruined your game imo

app, mobile, The mobile app just keeps crashing at the start of any game even in PvE
update, newest, Was forced to unistall and reinstall the game as the newest update wouldn't even load. I've now lost my account, my progress and all motivation to keep this game.
update, last, Was fun until this last update now I can't connect to the server
campaigns, solo, Would have been 5 stars as loved this game but not having any response by the developers is not on..so publicly my issue with this game has been grinding and paying through solo campaigns to gain RARE cards and build a deck I'm happy with..for the developers just removing those campaigns from the game along with the cards in the deck. Grind and money needs some kind of compensation as neva are free.

purchase, accidental, Son made an accidental purchase over $100 and blizzard made no effort to help me with the refund.
change, recent, The game has been asking me to write a review for a while now. I've held off for whatever reason but they're most recent change of adding this Diablo character to battlegrounds has completely ruined the experience for me. So one star good job

match, other, Changing my review, I'm wasting my time when every other match fails to connect. Then when I reboot the game I have lost 4 turns and I just don't think that's fair.
time, Second, Second time in as many months - it update loops. Says needs to go to store, goes to store, nothing to update, goes back start again. Uninstalled, rebooted, same shi7s Love it. kind of expensive. Also, they are run from a sexist creep. Sadly, Blizzard betrayed gamers by capitulating to China & punishing Hearthstone champion for expressing his support of Hong Kong. Blizzard's censorship is an attack on democracy & human liberation. For that, I've uninstalled all Activision/Blizzard games.

periods, long, Very expensive, bugs that don't hurt dev's botton line often go unfixed for long periods of time. New expansions often break the wild format or the standard format. New modes are introduced at the cost of fixing bugs or balancing.

battle, impossible, Love the game, haven't had any issues until recently. I've been playing the story mode and I'm at the Malfurion vs Ragnaros part. I've played this battle over 50 times now with every strategy possible and haven't come close to beating him. This needs to be looked into because I believe this is an impossible battle to win. Thanks.
game, amazing, amazing game
games, other, Get it it's really fun and unlike other games like this skill still beats having put 100£ into it so it really isn't pay to win
months, recent, I'd give the game itself 5 stars but the stability of the Android version has gotten worse and worse over recent months. Game is basically unplayable currently = just go and play on the PC instead...

connection, wired, Been playing for years. Unfortunately it is starting to crash lots, needs reinstall sometimes and looses connection often, even on a wired computer connection which makes it frustrating to enjoy Way too many unstable connections to make 20 minutes of game time with coffee not as relaxing as it used to be, glad I'm not a new player. I've stopped playing on other devices and uninstalled them. I don't mind a challenge but keep loosing progression due to game crashes and hang ups and waiting.. FFS

case, worst, Rng can be off putting. Game sometimes bugs out and you need to clear cache, or worst case reinstall. Overall fun, but has some detractors.

result, same, Uninstalled until it's fixed. The game requires a download from the store. It does nothing once the store opens up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with the same result.
month, more, This app routinely freezes in the middle of a game. While the games are fun, this makes them irritating. I will give the one more month and if not fixed, you will not see a penny from me ever again.
time, long, Doesn't work at all , i don't know what's happening but i played this game for a long time on my pc and my phone aswell , i stopped for around a yeard and now ive been trying to get the game working for last 2 hours!!! Just doesnt load and nothing. Im really dissapointed

deck, agressive, Game used to be fun. Wanted to waste my time and money on it. Constructed has degraded into 4-6 turns /game with everyone trying to have the most agressive deck possible. Oh and the app constantly crashes on mobile and has lost me many many games battlegrounds through the rope/timer not being accurate (up to 25 seconds!!!)

strike, 1st, Been playing casually since 2014 and on the verge of quitting due to the changes put out this year. 1st strike is introducing quests that are required to win most of the time and just go straight face, it's bad enough we have to deal with netdeck p2w. 2nd strike is pushing new modes I'm not interested in without being able to opt out (having to recycle daily/weekly quests constantly). 3rd strike is the game keeps disconnecting on mobile and now won't even update from the store.

update, last, Totally locked out after last "update". Quality of the app has been going downhill for a while now, don't give them your $$.
years, last, I've been playing hearthstone for the last two years first on pc and then I downloaded it on my phone too, it's a classic. Love it.
thing, holy, I love the game to be honest and I have soo little to hate about it. But The thing, the one holy thing that keeps driving me crazy is the following bug: -It tells me I should update, I do so and I try to open the app but it tells me to go update again. But then the app store tells me it's up to date... An infernal loop that can only be broken by clearing the data or reinstalling the app and all its glorious giga bites...

card, best, Not only One of the best card games ever made but the best mobile game ever made. If your loyal to the game you will get as much gold (also used instead of irl money) and as much dust (used to create cards/decks) as you would ever need. Love how you need to change strategy on the go and think outside of the box to defeat your opponents. You might not get all things right blizzard **cough** Diablo mobile? *cough*, but hit this one we out the park. 5*

cards, perfect, Full RNG game that seems not so random when your opponent draws the perfect cards to not only counter your plays but also then destroy you. Latest update has stopped the game launching 👏 👏 👏

version, mobile, Hard to rate the mobile version of Hearthstone as the app is sluggish, unreliable and a nightmare to navigate. I have installed the app a dozen times today alone in an attempt to bypass a variety of glitches and crashes. The only fun I have had from Hearthstone Mobile so far is playing a game of proverbial whack a mole.. DO NOT INSTALL

game, good, Buggy and laggy throughout. If you want to play this game (and it is a good game), I suggest playing it on a computer, not a smartphone or tablet. Also, the newest update makes me unable to open the app, and there's no way to revert to an older version.

loads, infinite, P2W packaged in a buggy app that regularly crashes, locks up, and has infinite loads. Only "fair" game mode is battlegrounds but it is heavy luck / RNG based. Sometimes you get amazing draws sometimes you get garbage all game. Even so I would give it a 4/5 if the app itself weren't so unstable. The original hearthstone game / deck builder is 100% P2W. Avoid it like the plague. The single player mode is boring and hilariously still encourages P2W to speed up the grind.

cards, imbalanced, This game was fun and interactive when it came out, however, expansions totally killed its magic. Developers decided to add imbalanced cards and use them to force players into playing expansion-specific deck archetypes. Any element of fun just got lost. The game is no more decided by skillful play and careful consideration of opponents deck, but merely by draw luck, as cards and their specific combinations are so strong that one card drawn card can basically kill an opponent on its own. The game of course not only doesn't offer any counter-action for the most powerful cards, but the developers even went out of their way to ban them (the cards which had the potential to counter some of the most powerful cards) from the game. It doesn't pay off to create a unique deck and surprise opponents with non-standard cards, because the difference in cards' power-level dictates what cards can you play to be successful. In other words: I really enjoyed the game up to the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, but afterward, it became an unfocused mess. In my opinion, it's not worth getting into at this point. "Battlegrounds" is a fun mode, but super luck dependent and the Arena suffers from the same issues as competitive: snowball effect can kill you without having a chance to react. Update: problems of luck and hyper-powerful cards are increasing every expansion. Your skill and experience don't matter in the slightest. Encountering 12/12 on the third turn against the druid, losing to single cards, opponents generating basically an infinite amount of cards from thin air, and insanely powerful cards which cost 0 mana (meaning there is no limit how many of them you can play during your turn) absolutely soured my experience with Hearthstone. Trash. Not worth the time investment.

The game of course not only doesn't offer any counter-action for the most powerful cards, but the developers even went out of their way to ban them (the cards which had the potential to counter some of the most powerful cards) from the game. It doesn't pay off to create a unique deck and surprise opponents with non-standard cards, because the difference in cards' power-level dictates what cards can you play to be successful. In other words: I really enjoyed the game up to the expansion Journey to Un'Goro, but afterward, it became an unfocused mess. In my opinion, it's not worth getting into at this point. "Battlegrounds" is a fun mode, but super luck dependent and the Arena suffers from the same issues as competitive: snowball effect can kill you without having a chance to react. Update: problems of luck and hyper-powerful cards are increasing every expansion. Your skill and experience don't matter in the slightest. Encountering 12/12 on the third turn against the druid, losing to single cards, opponents generating basically an infinite amount of cards from thin air, and insanely powerful cards which cost 0 mana (meaning there is no limit how many of them you can play during your turn) absolutely soured my experience with Hearthstone. Trash. Not worth the time investment.

money, anymore, Do not give Blizzard anymore money
chores, daily, If you are a free to play player, the daily chores are time coonsuming. Hundreds of cards are added yearly making it a never ending quest to keep up.
game, damn, 100% not worth your time or money just like everything else Blizzards releases these days. Every update its like your opponents get dumber and take longer to finish turns making you rather quit the damn game then hope Blizzard does something to help because you know they are only capable of making things worse
acc, old, Why I can't retrieve my old acc using facebook account? Does Heartsone deleted my account? It all start when Battlenet came....
size, massive, Has gotten continuously more complex since launch. Now it's barely even a card game anymore, really. That's just a feature of it. Endless updates, massive package size, game breaking updates every cycle... It's exhausting. I miss my favorite decks, when they worked. The meta changes way too frequently. It used to be loads of fun and now you're just fodder so pay for play folks can climb the ranked ladder. It's still fun, it's just... Exhausting. I miss solo adventures, too. & the "Sorry" emote!

review, fair, A fair review would the game has been updated with new game modes and achievements to make it entertaining. Card balancing and meta decks are still a big issue with many decks abusing unfair cards. Some other problems are disconnection issues with lower end phones and no option to lower graphics or turn off settings to improve performance. Overall it is playable but could be greatly improved. Edit: Playing against decks with 10+ legendaries is impossible to win against with no counter play. PTW

Edit: Playing against decks with 10+ legendaries is impossible to win against with no counter play. PTW

game, Excellent, Excellent game been playing since the launch
decks, same, Battlegrounds is great, duels is alright, everything else gets really boring quite fast. People play the same 4-5 decks, mercenaries is the same thing 500 times, and the arena seems like an outdated idea.

mode, initial, Deathrattle hunter was hype at it's peak. Nowadays I think the game mode of battlegrounds is more enjoyable and easier to get into when compared to the initial Hearthstone game mode as there's no card collection barrier.
ringtone, free, Wanted free ringtone. I'm 71 years old .don't play games
decks, slow, I decided to update my review, because I feel like these quest decks are stopping me from playing slow decks and I love using control warlock, warrior and priest I recently moved to battlegrounds and mercenaries, because my opionin this current expansion /meta really isn't fun for many people including myself So I really need nerf or buffs that can at least help me play again quest mage, shamen, warlock, hunter and even warrior But don't get me wrong I still love playing the game even if I'm f2p

positives, enough, Hearthstone's a Blizzard game, so do with that what you will. But if you like buying trading card game packs, working with what you get, and trying to counter the meta, Standard and Wild are for you. If you like Slay the Spire's progression, play any of the bonus modes and have fun. Especially Duels, that mode is slept on. In short, sure this game's got problems, but I've played since Dalaran Heist and I think it's got enough positives to be one of my favorite games ever.

apps, worst, One of the worst apps compared to desktop version. It keeps reconnecting sometime 8-10 times a game. The reconnecting has gotten worse lately, but still something it had from the beginning so if you went from wifi to cellular it disconnected And every reconnect takes from 30 sec to 60 sec
graphics, Excellent, Excellent graphics. Have to have good internet and good memory on your device. Quarterly comes out with new challenges and some new cards and features or games.

issues, mentioned, Android app is trash. constantly freezes and crashes. Sucks particularly for duels where you have only three lives. Only worth playing on pc which is inconvenient. Phone version sucks and end up losing more often than not due to previously mentioned issues. They don't fix the issue either, they putting user. I've done everything, clear cache, reinstalled, etc but it's obviously the app itself

update, new, I have been playing and paying for heartstone for years, but with the new update that has ended. First it was impossible to install an update on my iPad because the game became too big to download. Now it has become impossible to play on my android phone because the animations are too much and it keeps loosing its connection. If Blizzard only wants to develop this game for PCs, they should stop offering mobile versions completely.

connections, stable, Garbage netcoding, especially on for mobile. The app constantly disconnects and freezes even on stable internet connections constantly costing games. While it is just a game it gets very frustrating after multiple instances especially if you're trying to play a little more competitively. Would honestly give it 0 stars if I could since I've been playing hearthstone for so long and they still haven't even able to make sure that their game runs at least somewhat consistently after all these years.

хуже, стала, После обновлений оптимизация стала ещё хуже. Даже нету банальных настроек графики в настройках. Не заходит в режимы против ИИ, просто пишет "Не удалось подключится к сессии".
decks, themed, Love the fun of creating themed decks and strategising, I used to play everyday, but too many issues with this game: crashes randomly, rip-off / con-artist prices for cards / packs which seem to give buyers an unfair advantage in ranking. It's as if you can't progress about 10 Gold rank unless you spend money, a complete waste of time and emotions! Buy a console game for the same price and you'll be better off...

love, much, Just played Scabbs' solo. Guff, "Hey you guuyyysss!!!" Love, love, love the throwback to the Goonies!!! So much love for you Hearthstone!
f1, 5yo, playing on a 5yo poco f1, the game loads are kinda slower than the pc version, the in-game bugs are a bit of a problem (shop, achievement scrolling, black screens and dcs) but it runs kinda fine. the game itself is amazing, even though the in-game transactions feel expensive hearthstone is one of the most free to play and new player friendly trading card games in comparison with physical games like magic and yugi. so my review will stick to 5/5 stars

game, Great, Great game with decades of history behind it and multi-game and platform syncronicities. That being said: 4 star until cards have a "Wear Rating" and are tradable. Otherwise, the investment in this game is purely self-entertainment with the potential for 3rd party monetary gain. The players, whom are 50% of the reason why the game exists, deserve their fair share. There is a very good reason why CS:GO has generated greater international wealth than any other fps by massive margins.

content, Great, Great CCG content, simple and easy to understand for new players but rely a little too much on RNG. The Battlegrounds mode is an excellent auto-battler too.

space, much, It's to much space for a phone and need to know to much but if it's that ok for you than you should play it because it's very fun but I think it best for computer -update I still think it's best on a laptop, space isn't an issue anymore now that phones have gotten better. My main issue with the game is that it's blooting itself with different smaller mobile games inside it rather than focusing on making the main game it's best.

Dropped to1 star until this is fixed and again, if the update isn't ready to be rolled out everywhere don't release everywhere.

decks, unique, I've been playing since almost release. never had to pay but I'm not a try hard and have unique decks letting me get far in ranked. the metas are annoying but bad kids need some way to win. This was two years ago. They doubled down on pay to win. Not worth it. Gives legendaries out like candy now to make a meta rather than people making strats.

games, different, Love this game! Lots of different games to choose from and they are constantly updating it. Kek
players, single, Another update another day I can't play the game. Fix your updates. Every single one locks players out of the game for at least a few hours
cards, old, Its not working for my phone now. Keeps redirecting to google apps. My old cards seem to be gone and achievements removed. Have to start over.
issues, serious, Love the game, serious stability issues.
modes, different, Fun Game. A lot of different modes to choose from.
game, Open, 11/17 update. Please update your game. Go to play store. Update. Update completed. Open game. Please update your game.... do I need to give the "Its 202" speech again? Lazy, money grabbing bleep holes.
games, few, I've had this game four years now. One of the few games you don't have to pay money to have fun. Every once in a while you'll have a match freeze up but rarely happens.
connections, bad, Have fun with Mobil updating loops and bad connections. Unplayable on mobile unfortunately. I have been playing since the games release.. what's going on at blizzard..
year, past, App works for me most of the time. It's got SLIGHTLY better over the past year or so but still randomly disconnects which ends games and crashes often enough to be bothersome. I'm glad it's an app, but if you can play on PC, it's just not good enough to depend on yet.
time, long, Why is it everytime there's an update, the game crashes? I been playing for a long time and this always seems to be the biggest flaw. Please fix to make it enjoyable again

I've searched hi and low for a fix, went through blizzards hoop jumping customer support and got a email back stating what I already told them i did. No help on the matter at all. Now the game will not send me my sms auth code when signing in.

job, great, "An update is required to play Hearthstone but it is not yet available in the store. Please check back later." great job Blizzard.
update, new, The game says a new update is needed, but it's not available in the store yet. WTH does that mean Blizzard?
waster, annoying, Fun time waster, not too annoying at this point. **After recent update on android, had to delete data and cache from google play store app for hearthstone to open.**

work, good, After a lot of 1 star review I thought is a time to give them a bit of a break and give them disserved 5 stars. Keep up the good work
Edit, mobile, They really should add a 60 fps mode for mobile Edit: Rating changed from 5 to 3. Hearthstone seems to be suffering the same fate as World of Warcraft, even if to a lesser degree. The ship is sinking, and giant changes need to happen. The amount of power creep from expansions have reached the critical level of cheaply made mobile games

connections, unstable, Garbage app. Very buggy. Needs to be reinstalled after updates sometimes. Deals exceptionally badly with unstable connections. Even in single player. It takes so long to get through the reconnecting phase you can miss a turn if you lose connection for a fraction of a second twice in a turn. Minimizing the app disconnects it. Reconnecting frequently requires restarting the app because it will just endlessly fail to reconnect. Updates say they will download in the background but only do sometimes.

types, fun, Some really fun game types but Hearthstone is oversaturated with microtransactions. You can't play standard without pumping way too much money into packs. Also updates tend to break the mobile app, which is particularly frustrating.

annoyances, many, Game requires an update that is not available in the store yet. Just one of many annoyances that add up. An option to remove animations would be great, mobile is already laggy and buggy enough. It's a huge money sink, with too many half assed game modes.

problem, Same, **update** Same problem as the last expansion. A loop of "download update" and "go to the play store" I guess it should be expected by now. **FIXED** Why am I stuck in a loop of "open the Play store" and "downloading"? I've been playing this game since 2017 with very few issues. Fix please!

games, favorite, It was one of my favorite games after WoW, but same as WoW it's just becoming worse. For years I was hoping they will improve, but it's just becoming worse.
input, real, It's no longer a card game anymore, and has simply dissolved into a video game where you just essentially watch the cards play without any real strategical input from yourself.

producer, big, I love the game and find it relaxing, but was a bit worried about the comments about bugs that i havent encountered much myself to date.. But today, opening my app and finding out that an update is required to play but not yet available in the store....I find that unnacceptable for such a big game producer... It should at least be playable in the most basic form...no? I will also use the occasion to point out that the shop is way to expensive for deck's or battleground skin's...

game, Great, Great game. Too many updates. And there needs to be a way to report other players. About 30% of the time you get paired with a player that doesn't want to play. They just wait for the timer to start hit the special skill then wait for their time to run out. So you're left with the choice to take the loss or waste your time on waiting for the timer.

devices, older, The game runs fine on my device, sometimes I crash, whatever. I'm using a note 10. My wife's game crashes more. Her device is a bit older. Me and her are well aware that older devices crash more on games like hearthstone/codm these games require more power. However blizzards greed makes the game unplayable for new friends. Try explaining to your friends it will take them 2 years before they are caught up in standard, let alone wild. And stop adding new modes. I don't like auto chess I like tcg

version, mobile, I've been playing Hearthstone for 5 years now. I love the game. However the mobile version has been crashing with more and more frequency. (11/17/2021). I think this is because of all the new stuff in the game, which I love!! However Blizzard needs to fix the performance issues. If they do I'll come back and edit this review

service, good, The disconnection issue is location. When I have good service it works fabulous. When I have 1 to 2 bars or no wifi sure I get disconnected. But the battlegrounds is by far my favorite update they've made to the game over the years.

I have a new phone now an have found there has been no issues at all. I don't know if it cause this new phone is a 8 core and the old one was 4 core. It's banging! So ppl with issues, it may not be the game, just your devices.

game, solid, A solid game but with many flaws. Continuous prompts to buy expansion packs and other features that inundate the play experience. I've been playing this game now for close to 5 years. As with all the other reviewers, the Android version of the game is just horrible! I've had great success on the PC. I do get frustrated with the amount of pay-to-play features that the game continues emphasize. So much potential!

version, android, Update: The android version has become so unstable it is barely playable now. Crashes and disconnects are a regular occurrence. I still think it's a great game, but this review is for the Android version and right now that has been ruined by bugs and instability. This game is great fun. The only downside has been how much of my free time it has sucked up.

game, fun, It's like Magic meets Pokemon but if you are a player not intending to spend ANY money then you will fall behind on being competitive. But it is a very fun and addictive game. UPDATE Still like I said from before lol. The RNG will piss you off if you get an extended unlucky streak. NEW UPDATE seems too hard for attracting new players due to the classic set cost but aside from that still awesome. NEW UPDATE can't play due to the update "not available" in the Play Store. Devs are ruining the game.

leggy, awful, App is awful, slow, leggy. Crashes all the time. And whenever I update the game it always takes about 5 hours before I czn even open it. Just keeps telling me to update even after it is updated. Pc version is great, I'd go play on pc if I was you guys!!

issue, real, Ive played this game for years and i love it, even though its buggy and getting stuck in queue is a real issue, costing coins and/or rank.
game, fun, Edit: I have changed this from a 1 star to a 4 star. Still have reconnection issues even when sitting by my router but its a very fun game. I've played this game for years and now that I got the new update, I can't even get my game to play. So frustrated right now as ai have a newer phone and have never had this issue. So tired or every update making the game worst :( Eidt: I just want to be able to play at this point. I've restored my game, my phone, etc. Please fix this

time, Long, Brilliant, so clean on mobile. PC players have advantages but the game works quite well on mobile. Long time Magic the gathering player, but started HS not too long ago as a free player and it works great for casual gaming. Edit: 2 year update, please introduce a setting of "reduced or no animation". While pc players can queue multiple actions, it can't be done on mobile, leading to a different gameplay experience. Edit: 3rd year deduct a star due to no turning off animations and mercenaries

app, terrible, Fix your terrible mobile app. Install the update, but the game won't start because I need to install the latest update to play. Nice one, do some upgrade path testing next time.

buggy, super, super buggy and laggy on phone
connection, excellent, Love the game, but the app disconnects too often, lately more than ever. I can't even play against AI, not to mention player vs player battles. I have an excellent internet connection and my device hasn't encountered any problems with ANY other application. If this gets fixed, I'm going back to five stars 🤩

stars, Permanent, No developer/customer support. Permanent 0 stars. Also, your description says "Anything you can buy, you can earn." This is simply not true, most things in the store can not be bought with in-game currency.

concept, great, Demon seed was a great concept and still is but as a warlock main.. I must admit that it was a bad idea from the start. And their way of fixing it is making it a bad card in standard and banning it in wild. Its design choices like this that make the base game mode unplayable. Some cards are just flat-out broken while others are awful. The Battlegrounds and mercenarys modes are great but the base game is getting worse with every expansion.

system, ranking, the battleground ranking system is suck pls change it
pass, new, Have casually played the game for ~6 years but this new battle pass is terrible
dev, bad, Games lag making it unplayable - feels like a memory leak. Also downloads 1.4Gb of data FOR A CARD GAME WITH BASIC ANIMATION? Feels like bad software dev to me. Updated to add : now with new improved extra animation lag! Incompetent developers. update again : you need an update thats not in the store yet. FFS, yet more release hopelessness.

app, android, The game is awesome, I've been playing it for years but the android app could definitely be a lot better
stone, hearth, Trying to sign in and it says an update is needed to play but there are none to install........ websites say that hearth stone is up and running with no problems.
game, mid, November 2021: Game continues to run poorly on Android. Often resorting to restarting the app mid game.
update, new, Everytime i go to play its a new update and its becoming annoying. 11/17/22 Why force a update that's not available, just stupid smh!

term, long, Too expensive and boring in long term
card, fantastic, Used to be a fantastic card game, now it is strictly for profit, and just waiting to die. I would not start playing this at this point in time if I was looking for a card game to get into.
weeks, few, The game seems ever increasingly pay to play if you want to play competitively. Perhaps you could just charge players a dollar a month and give everyone access to all cards. Having to pay 20 dollars every few weeks to get newer cards is rediculous.

update, last, I did the last update from store but when i hit play the game say there is and update from store and the game close
company, horrible, Do not play. Blizzard is a horrible company
incompetence, Pure, Forced an update, then the update is unavailable. Couldn't make it up. Pure incompetence.
money, much, This game use to be fun but not any more, they want you to spend way to much money every 4 months. They have ruined the game play, they Constantly change cards in what they call Balenceing. They Constantly add modes to try and get you to spend more money, there latest mode is mercenaries and it is nothing but a Gatcha game mode to rip you off, I'm moving on to something else after spending hundreds of dollars on this game I'm not spending another penny.

disconnects, Constant, Crashes, hangs more and more. Constant disconnects. Self update us unreliable
cycle, ending, Ahhhhh...the never ending cycle. This games will never work on mobile. It's clear now. Broken again
platforms, mobile, Why did the update come out but not made available for mobile platforms? I open the app just to be told there is and update but it isn't available yet. Try again later! That's BS
times, many, I am getting really upset with how many times the game freezes up with animations still going. Making it so I cant even tell quick enough to have even a chance to restart the game. Over and over. Hope this gets fixed soon. Will change review from 1 star. Been a lot better recently. Now fix all the bugs we know about and I'll up my review again.
player, single, Why is all the content so expensive? $15 for a single player campaign against AI or 700 coins to purchase a piece. It takes forever to generate 700 coins.
misconduct, sexual, Company and CEO actively ingore sexual misconduct in its ranks.
years, great, Used to be great years ago, but now it's an awful game run by probably the worst developer/publisher in the industry, and is extremely bloated and runs terribly. Really just not worth your time, try Gwent instead.

content, more, I've been playing this game for over 5 years now and still love it! A lot of the hate lately has been that they've begun to push more content on people that you can pay for. At the end of the day you can still be a free to play player and have a good time - in fact my favorite game mode (Battlegrounds) is entirely free to play! They also do try to offer a lot of different price points if you want to pay which I think gets missed by a lot of people.

investment, considerable, Still poorly optimised, but now is monetized to the bones. Unplayable without a very considerable investment
experience, great, Hearthstone gets its beatings online for being too expensive. I get that. My issue is that I play on both my PC and phone, and it's awfully frustrating that I can't play on my phone if my profile has updated on PC. Not a great user experience.
game, great, great game enjoy playing preferably I play on my PC, but at times I hop onto one of my mobile devices being phone or tablet. My only issue I have is that on mobile device my games always tend to crash and log me out making me loose a round while in middle of a rank or battleground game. If there was a way to decrease the chances of a game crash or disconnection that would be really nice it tends to get annoying.

card, stupid, I will delete this game just because of this stupid mage "ignite" card... how can you be so blind adding this card.... 🤬🤬🤬
yacht, new, Get paying to win, Bobby needs a new yacht, and lawyer.
game, great, A great game, but cost a lot of money to be competitive. But there is enough content to enjoy even for a complete Newby.

Newby, complete, A great game, but cost a lot of money to be competitive. But there is enough content to enjoy even for a complete Newby.
strategies, many, If you want to play a fun card game look elsewhere, keeping it simple, it's hard and frustrating, when vs Ai it makes you feel like you have no chance in winning. I cba I've deleted after a couple hours of playing as I'm bored of trying so many strategies just to get wiped out by an Ai that just counters you perfectly
update, single, i have to uninstall and reinstall after every single update, what the hell, how can you not fix this? This is going on for months its really boring now.
game, great, great game
game, great, It's a great game .. but won't load or update anymore 🤬🤬🤬🤬 . It sucks for galaxy phones .
bugs, many, So many bugs. So expensive. Blizzard has more than enough money to please their fans but they just don't care. The old team is gone and it shows. It's become a greedy corporate and I strongly suggest to anyone who wants to try this BS to stay away.

Expansion, current, Android version keeps getting worse. Delays in updates when released are annoying and every week they are churning out something stupid to buy. Expansion are coming rapidly before you can get used to the current Expansion they are spitting another out to grab more cash. Newest Expansion is about as dumb as WOD was for WOW.

release, public, Been playing since it's public PC release in 2014 which was before ANY expansion, tavern brawl, battlegrounds, even ARENA wasn't out. It was just play mode and practice for the first couple weeks and I was HOOKED. The lore behind the heroes and cards got me interested in WoW more than I was when I actually played in 2012. So classic was a doozy. I've transitioned to Wild and have been summoning 4+ Juggernauts with the help of Brann, Dead Man's Hand and Taelon Fordring. Can't wait for FIAV!

breathe, new, Easy to learn, difficult to master. RNG continues to be a problem. Gets a new breathe of life every expansion. Still needs a few features to truly be good.
tener, deban, Cada vez se hizo mas p2w, entiendo que deban tener alguna ganancia, pero si tan solo el juego fuera mas justo divertido.
progression, Mercenaries, Mercenaries player progression is linear while the difficulty ramps exponentially it feels. Deck creation is to slow and both push for heavy in app purchases to match other games levels feeling on player progression. Battlegrounds is alright but even then you can only choose from two rather than four units until you spend a large sum of gold or pay for that pass. Solo adventures started off great but have slowly devolved into what's currently down via book of mercs/heroes. Pay2NormalPlay

years, few, I played for a few years after this first came out and loved it. Played when they changed it up, and still liked the game. But trying to play now, the game doesn't even start. I've tried Uninstalling and reinstalling, which really sucked, still doesn't work.
games, other, If you love MTG and other strategy games then this is the game for you
spot, same, It opens to the loading screen but it's just frozen on that. I tried reinstalling but got stuck in the same spot so it wont even download the data. This needs to be fixed immediately
option, best, After play some CCG's I have to say that HS is one of the most entertaining, but, its a game that relies only on luck, the levels of randomness are stupidly high, and thats its so frustrating, so if you want a game in which you want test your skills, this not the choice but if you want to test your luck this is the best option and the bad functionality in android and iPad's is absurd, I lost a lot of games for disconnections

deck, unlimited, The pirates have to go, its so unenjoyable, it's completely stupid to have a unlimited pirate deck that can destroy you in 5 turns
decks, specific, Are people in Blizzard too mentally challenged to realize how overpowerful are the Tavish (archer) and Juggernaut pirates (warrior) decks? It is not even fun anymore, it is just ridiculous. What is it now? You only need to build specific key decks to win? I am done...I am switching to Magic. Thanks for having killed the game.

turns, multiple, This game is fun... when you can play sadly I'd doesn't allow you to turn down graphics or just shut them off all together so you'll lag out or lose multiple turns. When they dropped the latest expansion I couldn't even sign in for 2 weeks

deck, good, Wouldn't be bad if they didn't change out decks every 3 months. Just when you get a good deck going it becomes obsolete. Don't waste the money
fun, much, better than I expected but still not much fun

decks, new, I love the addition of decks in the shop. It's a bit pricey so I'll stay on the lookout for new decks if one really hits the spot. Maybe you could even expand on it by adding limited decks like card backs with cards that will never come back. I think 1000 gold should be a fair price to get these. I liked the cute theme in battlegrounds portraits too. Battlegrounds is by far my new favorite mode. I hope you'll keep updating it :3

review, old, Bad. Also deleted my old review. Arm twisting to buy content is too much. Requires thousands of dollars to even look into being competitive. Also rigged - instead of winning more games as you gain understanding you lose more, probably because the matchmaking algorithm sees you as feed for the paid players.

games, many, Been playing this game since Open Beta. I enjoy it, however the mobile has been getting worse and worse. It's keep disconnecting and reconnecting... the connection is horrible. Thank goodness I don't pay money to play Arena, I have lost so many games by this issue. Blizzard please fix this issue.
laggy, little, Really fun and relatively simple! Can be a little laggy and takes up a lot of space but still really fun!
update, last, As of last update today, i lost all my progress in Mercenaries. It was addicting until then... Now i have to start over 👎 thumbs down
connection, stable, Mobile client is unbelievably bugged. Crashes all the time and I get disconnects even with stable internet connection. I lose an average of one game per arena run to a disconnect which is extremely frustrating. Also Diablo achievements are bugged. I just got a twelve win with him and it says i have never played with him. Fix your game Blizz. I've spent way too much to look past all the bugginess.
touches, actiblizz, Everything actiblizz touches dies.
years, few, didnt play this game for a few years and fell behind but definitely still good game

progres, Free, Pay 2 have fun basically. Free progres is mundane and slow. Balance is all over the place and the microtransation prices are really high. The visuals are cool tho
pop, canceled, Your sign in flow is broken on Android 12. There's a canceled pop up (probably Google Drive) resulting in looping back to a restart.
money, much, Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I loved this game. Lately? It's solitaire. Warlock, Mage, and Warrior quests are absolutely broken. It's pay to win and incredibly frustrating. The devs have given up on everything but making as much money as possible.
card, best, love this game best card game on the internet hands down.
kids, worst, Alot of bugs worst kids card game ever made by little kids mirror match, mirror match, mirror match and mirror match sounds fun right I guess if your two.

product, Laughable, Online is literally unplayable. Dc's and freezes galore. Save yourself the frustration. Laughable product from a AAA company.
game, Great, Great game with lots of different variations to keep it interesting. New sets often to keep things fresh. Nerfs after every set are kind of annoying. For the casual player if you play daily you don't need to pay to win.

ills, usual, Hearthstone suffers from the usual ills of Blizzard games. It is a fun and engaging digital card game with a lot of variety in its game modes, but it is also so grindy that the stellar gameplay gets forgotten in how utterly miserable it becomes to grind for new cards as a F2P player. On top of that, only the very smallest amount of cards are available for in-game currency, so you have to spend money to get anything of value.

gratification, instant, Is this a money grabber game? Sure, if you need instant gratification. With all the quests you can do, you end up making enough coin that you could easily buy plenty of packs with in game currency. Plus with Battlegrounds, and the new Mercenaries games, they've given options that require little to no need for purchases. I've truly enjoyed playing their newer game styles, and barely touch standard anyway. I think some people just need to take a chill pill.

greed, pure, I can not recommended this to anyone, anymore. The pure greed that is being pushed out of the shop is baffling. We are talking $15-$30 for cosmetic skins, for ONE game mode. Bundles that cost $60+ for less and less each year. Bugs that take forever to fix and have been in the game for months, are back seat to pushing out more cosmetic BS. Edit: Premade decks are now being sold for $21...These decks can be crafted for MUCH less than what they're charging. $21 LOL This isn't tabletop MTG, christ.

game, quick, The game is fun, it's just that whenever you want to play it's got an update waiting (even if you have auto updates on) and it takes 30 minutes (no matter your internet speed) before you can play :( Besides that the game is often so slow in loading that a quick game during a break is just not feasible.
game, diverse, Amazingly diverse game in general but what really hooks me is BATTLEGROUNDS!!! Its phenomenal and it hooked me that much that I'm now 600 top 4s and 200+ wins and I'm going for a thousand!!!!!
gambling, Random, Random gambling like addictive game, that is not rewarding at all. Game could have some RNG elements but this takes it to a new level. No long term benefit to player besides a quick dopamine rush, might as well play candy crush . So called strategy game, based purely on RNG.

game, favorite, Yeah no, this used to be my favorite game but it's really not enjoyable anymore... It's incredibly difficult to play decks that you enjoy without getting absolutely destroyed by the meta (that changes every few months so good luck keeping up $$$), making it impossible to pick a class to stick with and disenchant all other class cards to save dust (aka they make more money from the player.) You WILL have to spend money to enjoy the game no denying that, don't expect to play for free and win :)

reconnects, Constant, The experience is terrible. Constant reconnects and disconnects during matches.
thanks, overpowered, Thank you for finally fixing that glitch. Just can you debuff the mutanus boss in the solo adventure mode I think the hero power of the boss is a bit overpowered thanks
termination, sudden, The updates are causing a lot of problems. Looping, non-response while starting the app and sudden termination of the app itself. It makes it really hard to enjoy the game. Also swapping between apps now causes hearthstone to restart the whole application and kill the game instead of disconnection and reconnecting

game, mobile, Fix your mobile game. Stop acting like an indie company that just started out. You are a huge business by you can't optimize a damn mobile client of your game. Oh but you can update the store with stupid "deals" twenty bucks for a single Merc card? Are you insane or just smoking meth up at HQ? Why would I pay you any money if you can't optimize a damn game. Top of the line and new phone too.

version, mobile, The mobile version is unplayable. I cannot tell you the number of times the game just crashes or I am inexplicably disconnected from my stable Internet. Shows you how little respect Blizzard has for its users. Just a terrible experience.

moments, crucial, The game just keeps crashing at crucial moments. I've lost track of the number of times that I've lost a duels or arena match simply because my game crashed and was incapable of reopening before I lost the game. It's infuriating and I'm getting fed up
app, Unstable, Unstable app
game, great, great game but very expensive if you want to perform in it
regret, only, LOVE all of Blizzard's games. My only regret is that the app could not be smaller however given the amount of game data necessary to play the full game on mobile I guess it's to be expected.

metas, worst, I have played this game since cockatrice, and this has been ONE of the worst metas. I can't even say in a long while because you guys printed Demon Seed 3 months ago. Duels, Standard, and Wild are all very terrible. The only play mode that is fun is the Dungeon runs and tavern brawl(and TB is in there because the computer plays the game like a drunk.) Fix the game by nerfing or reworking pirates and/or questlines.

game, fantastic, This game has all the bones and structure to be a fantastic game. Unfortunately, unless you wanna spend considerable money here, then there's not much for you to do. You either have to play like it's your full-time job, to earn small amounts of currency to buy card packs, or drop $$$ on packs to have a chance to compete.

versions, worst, One of the worst phone app versions of a game I've ever played. Constantly freezes and if you minimize to check a text you automatically lose because it takes a year to reconnect. Wish I could give this 0 stars.
requirements, tedious, Wanted to play arena mode only but game forces tedious requirements before I can, so now uninstalled

ramp, steep, Way too grindy. Mercanaries is a waste of time. You'll be cruising along and then all of a sudden there is a steep ramp up in difficulty. I quit in less than a month.

expansion, latest, Absolutely pay to win. Must buy the latest expansion to get the best quest cards (Quest Mage) with which it's impossible to lose. The new Mercenaries game mode (like the entire game itself) is nothing but a cash sink. I spent $150 and had no issues in PvP till I started coming up against people that spent more. For shame Blizzard. This is bad and you should feel bad.

update, non, I agree the game itself is ok, the problem is the platform, android. Hearthstone on android just keeps crushing/disc over and over. For example, the game updates itself after 5 minutes. The auto update, non-pauseable, comes with free drop out of the game, then crush on reconnect. I encountered this 3 times today. 1 star is way too overrated for the quality and QA, if there is any QA.

game, good, Once a pretty good game, now it's heavily pay to win. Be prepared to pay $100+ (AUD) every 3 months to a company with pretty questionable morals if you want to have at least one competitive deck. As an aside, since beta the app has had barely any quality of life improvements, is buggy, the slightest lag in internet can cause a massive crash, etc. Disappointing considering the ability of the producer. Decks are becoming more repetitive, expect to enjoy for a few hours a month.

system, monetary, I've been playing Hearthstone for years, and I keep leaving dissapointed. I know the game would be great if I dropped a few hundred dollars on packs, but as the monetary system is now I wouldn't recommend anyone to the game.
thing, sole, I find it hard to believe that everyone I face can top deck the sole thing they need for a victory yet when I need a few cards to execute a smidge of a game plan they are always at the bottom of the deck. This isn't just occasional this is every game. People literally blow through their entire deck before I can find a simple card and any victory I do achieve is purely through my own wit and skill because I can't possibly draw any beneficial card to aid me in anything. This game is struggle atm.

years, several, I recently reinstalled this after not playing for several years. It's gotten noticable worse. It says there's no account associated with my information when I try to recover it, but if I try to make a new one it says an account already exists with that information. The game itself has turned into a shameless money grab with exorbitant prices for not much content. The new cards and mechanics are not very interesting and the game crashes and feeezes a lot now.

fun, Super, Super fun for a free game, but like all games it has issues. The card game is fun but pay 2 win, and if you aren't buying the newest card packs you most likely aren't winning. Battlegrounds is the best part, it's unique and fun to play, and you can play w 2 friends. The new mercenaries mode is good if you want to play solo (not competing against others) but can get a bit grindy. The solo adventures are highly slept on and very fun. This game has issues but is worth the price (free)

mercenaries, new, Super fun for a free game, but like all games it has issues. The card game is fun but pay 2 win, and if you aren't buying the newest card packs you most likely aren't winning. Battlegrounds is the best part, it's unique and fun to play, and you can play w 2 friends.

client, mobile, Over the course of 7 years the mobile client has degraded performance and the game quality is not the same. My rating has been edited accordingly. You should play this on your PC if you play at all.
direction, wrong, The game is going in the wrong direction both from a pacing perspective (hyper aggro, game end within 7 turns usually) and the ever ballooning new mechanics and card sets that force you to continually spend money to remain relevant. I have been playing (and spending money) this game since its initial launch and I just can't in good conscience continue to soend money on it at this point. It is a good card game to be fair, but blizzard is just milking it way too hard.

update, last, No clue what happened with this last update but for the first time in the history of the mobile app, I'm getting hard, app-closing crashes. Boom, home screen. No lag or anything to telegraph it. Something broke and it was recent. More later

turns, few, Uninstalled. Each expansion takes this further away from a game requiring strategy and thought. Game is basically now just a "shoot out" over in a few turns. Winner is determined based on luck and willingness to play 'dumbed' down quick decks. No longer possible to win with clever strategies.

game, own, Separate Battlegrounds to its own game. No one likes anything else 👍
skins, opening, Mercenaries is fun but the money I've spent doesnt feel worth it. Packs feel bad especially when I'm looking for legendaries and opening legendary skins.

turns, first, Hearthstone, 1 star. Battlegrounds, 4 stars. Hearthstone lost its appeal. 90% of the time you can figure out whos going to win each match within the first two turns. Basically everybody uses the same decks and it's just boring and Mindless. Fortunately Battlegrounds came out and saved this app/game.

points, many, Terrible! Disconnects constantly after update unexpectedly... I've lost so many BG points. Needs patching pronto.
turn, single, First the game was really great, but each time the game is updated, the game starts to Struck more & more, now I can't even play one single turn of the game, cause it keeps getting automatically stops working and exits, then I would go & start the game again, but it will automatically exits again & again. Updates made the game worse & worse. Keep this up and you will lose all your players...😠😠😠
counter, own, The game could use some more balancing so the match wouldn't end so quickly. Each class has its own counter and that's kinda ruining the playstyle.
games, favourite, One of my favourite games of all time, but ridiculously expensive. I play every day, literally every day, and I really enjoy the game but even for someone who plays every day for 3hours minimum, even I am restricted with what I can do in terms of decks because packs, cards and everything included is way too expensive.
game, great, A great game wrapped in a sucky app. The gameplay is really good. I can spend hours playing. Super cool. The app is like a n annoying child with internet separation anxiety. So many "disconnected" and "check your internet" errors that take forever to "reconnect". Sometimes it asks you to restart the app. I can assure you that this is not an issue with my phone or home internet, this is the only app that's giving me connection issues. Also what's with the manual updates? And why does it need 4gb?

game, great, great game and concept but game crashes alot sadge
game, Great, Great game not many problem's so far

network, bad, The game is ok, but the app is quit bad... Extrem bad network handling, as you play a game as getting slower and lagging the UI. At the end you have to restart the game, because from 1.5 minutes round you wait 1 minute to get back the control.
game, ptw, Maybe the most ptw game of all times
transactions, Micro, Blizzard is awful. App is bad. Micro transactions are everywhere
update, recent, I dont know why but after the recent app update, I cant search my wild cards using mana costs/search function etc. and have to browse one by one . If not it would have been 5/5
cards, wild, I dont know why but after the recent app update, I cant search my wild cards using mana costs/search function etc. and have to browse one by one . If not it would have been 5/5
connection, good, I mean come on... hours to update.. (with a good connection...! Doesn't matter wifi cell 4g 5g..... ) Other then that yeah not that great....
pack, starter, I bought the mercanaries starter pack, and it's now been a month and I still can't get it to load. All it does is state that an error has occurred and try again, I'm tired of trying, so I wasted that $. At least I can still play all the other games on it.

card, great, cant find anything wrong. great card game
system, New, New reward system is garbage and requires more grinding than previous system. Blizzard is being greedy. Done with this game.

problems, technical, The game has technical problems, sure, but what they did is inexcusable, and Blizzard as a company should know better not to upset their most loyal fans. They recently introduced a battle pass to the game that has a free and a paid track. The pass costs 20 euros. That's a yikes but okay the majority of the stuff is in the free tier so okay. The problem is this new battle pass replaces the old quest system and hands out less gold when they promised it would do the opposite.

challenge, good, Tons of fun, good challenge
game, late, The meta is trash. Yet it only got worse with the deadmines mini set. Honestly Im a control player so its not for me. I kinda just want the game to last longer than 5 turns so I can make use to late game impactful cards. Instead Im stuck with people playing 30 cards and opponents getting the same win condition over and over on turn 5 or 6. Just not for me man :(

pack, free, I cant make a account to save my progress and get the free pack. Every time I go to put in my email it glitches me out. Also very laggy and choppy. They should put in a mode with lower resolution and no sound effects because it does feel like it's only playible on a computer.

game, best, This is the best game.
concepts, cool, This game has added alot cool game concepts over the years, as Ive been playing since launch. Unfortunately, as of today I uninstalled this game. It's completely PTW and only for profit at this point with the newest addition of Battle Ready decks for sale in the shop. 4 legendary minions and the deck built around them for $14.99? Casual players will never compete with the moneybags on ladder at least not with the pace of the meta. Totally sucks now. Bye Blizzard

bugs, constant, The game itself is very fun and gets your brain thinking. It doesn't get old, because every time you play, you never know what you're going to be dealt. What does get old is the constant bugs and lagging that the app itself has. I always have problems inviting my friends that are online, but the invite button doesn't show. They have to restart their app several times in order for it to work. The menus are slow and laggy, you never know if it's going to scroll and what you're going to hit.

fun, much, You can be competitive with budget decks as f2p if you do your dailies, but the game isn't very much fun anymore. Power creep and broken decks frequent standard and wild so the original game mode isn't good and the most OP decks aren't interactive and played like a single player game. Battlegrounds and arena are okay. Haven't dabbled with mercenaries much yet.

balancing, shotty, I enjoy the game enough where it's 5 stars. There are downsides i.e. microtransactions, shotty balancing etc.. but it's still fun enough with duels and standard for this rating.
update, single, Every single update I had to reinstall the app because it wouldn't update...
game, Great, Great game. The only one I play on my phone anymore. My only complaint is Blizzard's customer support is wanting. They don't always address that they are aware of issues.

stuff, new, Loved this game for years. I like that it is still getting updates and new stuff regularly.
fun, Endless, Endless fun. nuff said
classes, new, I like the game play,love collecting the cards, reminds me of childhood and the hockey card collection I had as a kid, only now it's digital. I like the addition of new character classes, can't wait to see more.
issues, bad, I used to have really bad issues with connection. Things have improved a lot. They're also putting in effort to make the game great. Honestly hearthstone is my favorite videogame of all time probably.
