VERB, PREP, POBJ, 
played, for, reason, still play this kairosoft classic five years after buying. if for some reason youve not played it. do it now!
worry, about, money, I got this game almost 5 1/2 years ago after seeing a work colleague play it. Even today I absolutely love this game. I'll admit it's not the best, nor for everyone, but for those who like development tycoons it's great. It's simple, yet still provides challenge when starting out. Once you figure out the right set up of people and no longer worry about money it can get a bit repetitive though. I love the punny names of the employees. I wish there was more late game advancement.
stands, as, one, Still stands as one of the best Kairosoft games. Kudos
Expand, on, genres, So much about this game is fun and wildly addicting. I would love to see a sequel that adds more content and depth. Do PC OS instead of just PC as a console that never grows. More office upgrades and longer than 20 year story would be awesome too. Expand on genres allowing one than 2 at once.
explore, into, it, Haven't gotten to explore too much into it, but so far really enjoy the aspects of the game.
played, through, game, I've played through this game over 20 times and it's different and just as fun every single time.
played, over, times, I've played through this game over 20 times and it's different and just as fun every single time.
went, with, options, Wish there was a 2nd one that went deeper with new options and it would be cool to see how other companies are doing and lots of little things like that but this game is fun for a while and quite addicting
playing, for, years, I've been playing it for so many years now and it still does not get old. I wish there was more.
add, to, it, Love this game more the other dev games wish they would add more things to it like a bigger office more little things like actual getting the million or little prizes but I have brought the game and its worth the price
add, like, office, Love this game more the other dev games wish they would add more things to it like a bigger office more little things like actual getting the million or little prizes but I have brought the game and its worth the price
browse, for, offices, Only thing i wish is to browse around for different offices whenever i like.
lost, in, it, Great fun, can get lost in it for hours!
lost, for, hours, Great fun, can get lost in it for hours!
rotates, with, phone, Solid as hell, from a better era of mobile gaming. No microtransactions or anything of that ilk. Only complaint is that the screen always rotates with the phone whether or not the global setting is on
finished, in, 5hrs, Great game, but there were some issues of understanding the words and it was too easy, finished the game in 5hrs
hooked, for, days, It's quirky, it's fun, it had me hooked for days. Well done Kairosoft
playing, for, days, Highly addictive, been playing for 4 days straight now and just won the grand prize.
play, in, school, I used to play this game back in high-school, recently downloaded it while on break at work and have fallen back in love with the game.
playing, for, while, Awesome game! I been playing on and off for a good while and finally just won the grand prize haha! Super challenging in its own way. Love the game
challenging, in, way, Awesome game! I been playing on and off for a good while and finally just won the grand prize haha! Super challenging in its own way. Love the game
played, for, yrs, Haven't played for a few yrs but when i did i enjoyed the game play ive had over 400 hours of gameplay. I would love to be able to make games like this someday
seemed, on, playthrough, It was OK, took a while to figure everything out. Console licenses seemed restrictive, maybe on next playthrough they won't be.
used, to, them, Great game. Controls can be a bit funky until you get used to them. Otherwise, I'm really impressed with the UI - there aren't flashing buttons everywhere, and user is not presented with ads every 30 seconds.

got, after, years, finally got this game back after years of not having it. I love it so much !!
have, on, phone, Best game I have on my phone. Download it you won't regret.
going, at, work, Great game. Keeps me going at work
disappointed, with, purchase, Absolutely fun game! I think out of all the Kairo titles this one has to be my favorite. So simple yet so fun and entertaining! You definitely won't be disappointed with this purchase :)
work, from, bottom, Great game! Love the way you have to work your way up from the bottom
Played, for, years, Played for years now, let's me live out my dream as a game designer
cryied, as, developer, At first, felt strange. But then I tried harder, figured it out and loved it. THIS and dev Tycoon is best out there. But this..... as a developer myself I even cryied when I got the first grand Prize. I imagined that being true. â€¢ GIVE IT A TRY. Even graphics have a nostalgic feeling making you remember or dream.
designed, for, rpg, Fun, simple, and clean. It has very clear progression trees and game is very well designed for a mobile rpg
playing, for, years, Run game great time killer been playing for years
pay, to, win, Fun and non-intrusive, like mobile games used to be. (Doesn't stuff ads down your throat, no microtransactions or pay-to-win). Some small issues (hardware engineer, secret characters, secret consoles, and winning GOTY are all very difficult to figure out without using a guide, less attentive players might not notice several key mechanics, and a somewhat boring postgame), but overall well worth your time. A sequel with more fleshed out mechanics and customization would be awesome
killing, in, life, This game is single handedly killing my productivity in my waking life.
coming, for, years, Probably my favourite Kairosoft game, been coming back to this one for a few years and still loving it!
felt, in, year, I love this game. Totally addicting. Also since I won the grand prize, finally, in year 14, I felt I should leave a review.
Came, after, time, Came back to this game after some time, still absolutely love it
hooked, for, hours, Great game, had me hooked for hours ðŸ˜Š
growing, as, gamer, This game is great casual experience, with enough nods to your childhood growing up as a gamer. Good fun!
entranced, for, hours, Excellent. I was entranced for many hours. Outside world? People? Bugger all that! Thanks devs!
played, for, years, I've played this game for years over different devices! This game is the only reason that I was even excited to own an android phone.
deleted, with, dollars, I would give this game 5 stars but the game deleted my save with over 1billion dollars on it and I had the best console on that save it didn't even say that it was deleted I got on the game and saw no money in my save

playing, in, time, I love playing this game in my down time. It has become increasingly fun to try to get the grand prize.
play, through, career, This is one of those near-perfect games for me. I come back every few months to play through a career or two.
m, on, toilet, Great when im on the toilet and become bored
play, on, phone, Very addictive and fun. One of the few games I play regularly on my phone.
add, through, updates, Really fun game, love it just wish they would add more content to the game through updates, maybe more consoles or studios or customization
played, for, hours, Rewarding I was feeling sick and couldn't sleep and played this for hours in one sitting. I had to start a second game because I blew my money with stupid stuff but I got the hang if it.

see, to, many, Absolutely love it, would love to see more sequals to many of your games
playing, for, years, Been playing this game for years. I still enjoy starting a new company. This is probably the best game of the company. Second would be Grand Prix Story. Definitely good purchase.
playing, on, drive, I remember playing this on my drive as a kid...:">
had, on, fun, This games blackouts that happen are total bs. I spent 2 of the items I had on my fun in the game which got it into the 80s for the first time and the "random" blackout dropped it under 50. Total bs.

Got, on, whim, Got it a while ago on a whim while I was waiting at an airport as an alternative for Game Dev Tycoon, and gotta admit I enjoy it just as much if not more!

have, about, it, A very cute, casual manager sim. About the only real complaint I have about it is that it's on the short side - it only takes a few hours to hit year 20. But the upside is it's highly replayable, a good game to come back to every so often.
gained, after, games, It's fun but would have been better if each worker gained points after finish games and contracts. Also would be nice if the office can be expanded further since trying to get Gold is very difficult since you can't tell how other games are doing and how many companies you are competing against. But still a fun little app.

Had, with, game, Had a pretty good time with this game, full playthrough lasts a few hours but there's a fair bit of replayability also. I've enjoyed replaying through trying to rush certain targets sooner with each playthrough

do, with, update, Great fun but it feels like it stops just as it gets going. Could do with an update to bring us up to date with the newer consoles. I have not been able to get a staff member who can allow me to create my own console, no matter how many times I try to "hire" people.

wish, for, sequel, Great game wish for a sequel
snatch, in, heartbeat, I always end up coming back to this game. I really wish there was a sequel available for Mobile and in English, I would snatch that up in a heartbeat.
play, with, music, Fun and cute, but becomes repetitive. The random number generation can sometimes be frustrating and very clear that it is simply random. I must say it is addictive and easy to play with music or a youtube video in the background after a long day. It is satisfying once you build an amazing game.

See, for, yourself, See for yourself :)
play, during, flight, Downloaded this game to play during a flight and got hooked! Well done.
play, by, Karosoft, Great game with hours of addictive play time. I really enjoyed it. I love all of the little inside gaming industry jokes or references! Can't wait to play more by Karosoft. Update: I am still playing this game and it is a Kariosoft Classic. I've since played almost every other Kariosoft game!
put, into, game, Super addictive. I wish I could see how much time I've put into the game. I'm sure it's over a hundred by now.
owned, for, time, I've owned this game for a long time. Its a solid time waster.
attached, to, dude, I'm actually addicted. I get attached to the dude in the mask but his skills are minimal, I hate firing him.
pay, for, out, Nothin to fancy u get what u pay for out of it.
enjoy, in, 2021, absolutely amazing! even in 2021 i still can enjoy this game. kairo games took time to learn at first but after that you can totally enjoy all it has to offer.

played, for, years, I've played this game for years. It never gets old!
had, with, one, I had a ball with this one!
understand, in, beginning, It is a little hard to understand in the beginning but I absolutely love this game!
seen, to, date, Not as deep as a PC game (linear office progression for example), and some mechanics such as game direction are unclear at best, but the best Android game I've seen to date. Very addictive. Polished interface.
picks, to, game, It's hard to get a good handle on at first, but it really picks up to a very enjoyable game. I would recommend.
find, in, it, Love this game. I've deleted and redownloaded it multiple time just because I always find enjoyment in it. Even though it's over 10 years old.
played, for, years, I've played this for years on and off. Always great to come back to. Only thing I wish it had is more transparency on the mechanics of stuff. But it's still top notch and worth every penny.
get, towards, endgame, Decent game, can get a tad monotonous towards endgame with no clear paths
Fell, in, Love, Absolutely Wonderful. Fell in Love With The Graphics wished there were more time to play rather than a limit although you can play past that limit but it won't update your capita.

pass, on, deployment, This game has been a favorite of mine for over a year now...helped pass alot of time on a 7 month deployment! Wish there were content updates! EDIT2021. Game is still as great as ever.
making, in, time, Very fun, once you get the hang of it you'll be making top notch decisions in no time.
Loved, as, kid, Loved this game as a kid, still do.
played, for, years, I have played this game for years and always come back to beat my prior score and/or win Game Of The Year faster. It's always a challenge finding the right combination of staff, leveling and training them up.

hired, from, play, Addicting but limited I have a lot of fun playing. It's addicting but after a bit very repetitive. I would love to be able to carry a person I've hired from one play through to the next, or have more variety in the game play loop. But overall, it's a fun mindless game to play.

fight, off, boredom, I love all kariosoft games my job as boring af so it helps fight off the boredom
glued, to, it, Loved it took a few goes to get going but I'm glued to it now
becomes, After, that, It's addicting until you get the hang of it. After that, making the #1 game becomes easy. I wish there was a new challenge. All my staff are max level and can get 200 in every category.

Keeps, for, while, No ads to break game play. Keeps you busy for a while; I wish there were more customization options.
killed, to, time, Great game..... killed to much time
fell, in, love, It's Game Dev Story, the same game I fell in love with over a decade ago. No game has managed to quite match its charm and formula since, but at the same time it's certainly showing its age. This is one of the best and most venerable games on mobile, but it could use an expansion or sequel.

hits, in, 2021, Repurchased the game to relive my childhood. Still hits hard in 2021
feels, at, times, Pretty entertaining game although it feels fairly limited and repetitive at times, could be better in a few ways but overall, it's a good way to pass some time.
help, with, combos, I love this game. If you find it challenging there are tons of forums online to help you with combos but it takes practice too. Anyways this games just the best and I would love a sequel
fulfilling, than, this, It's OK but it Game Dev Tycoon felt more fulfilling than this.
add, to, game, Love this game played it on and off since it first came out. Just wish they would either add to the game, or release a second one. Perfect game for when you have nothing else going on! Please add content or make a sequel!
playing, for, years, Simple and fun!!! I've been playing this for years!!!
aiming, for, game, Fun game and before you realized it, you are aiming for the game of the year.
gets, after, while, I'm a fan Kairosoft games and have played several of their games and loved them, but this one gets a bit boring after a while. The tasks are quite repetitive so I find myself bored after a few days of playing this.
playing, for, time, This game I been playing on and off for a long time. I absolutely love it and finally won the million dollar ceremony. Thank you so much for the amazing game. I hope that someday there will be a sequel to it. P.s. Much love Joefraust!

runs, on, phones, A classic strategy RPG from back in the day. It's still as fun as ever and runs perfectly on the new android phones.
Played, for, years, Great game. Played it for years and have always enjoyed it.
crashing, on, nexus, Keeps crashing on nexus 5. Updated: Nexus 5 comment is old, works fine but 6, still fun to come back to years later.
running, in, background, The frame rate, once perfect on my Galaxy Nexus and Droid X, is abysmal on my newer, faster Note 4. This is pretty heartbreaking with nothing running in the background and my settings set to "Performance." Update: Smooth as butter!

moved, to, offices, I adore this game. Would have given it 5 stars if I could have moved to bigger offices more than twice. Some of the consoles that other developers bring out are a little too pricey for someone who knows nothing about game genres and direction, and I completed the game before I had even had chance to hire a hardware engineer to build my own console. However, once the game is completed you can still play on or you can start again with some of your achievements making next time round easier.

playing, with, friends, this is a really cute and addictive game, I remember playing this with my friends back when I was 8 I think. it's still just as fun as I remember it <3
noticed, to, own, Fun game, noticed different company reactions to your own. In one playthrough two companies were developing many consoles and in the other those consoles were discontinued while mine dominated the industry. Fun to play, easy to pickup

add, to, it, This is a great game, I have been on it off and on for years but know they really need to add some new stuff to it.
ask, for, what, Honestly just simple fun what more can you ask for!!!
making, to, levep, Its a fun little game. The only thing i would pike is that tou could research new game types and genres instead of having to keep making game to levep up in the hopes of learning new categories or gaining points to invest in your games.

update, with, consoles, I love this game its an accurate representation of actual games but wish they would update it with more upto date consoles
think, On, play, Addictive in the best way. On my fourth play through now I think! Edit: seems to run slower now that I have upgraded to android 5 (lollipop). Still, an awesome game!
Put, into, this, Put more hours into this than I would like to admit
set, to, skin, this dev never met a character model they wouldn't always set to white skin
reading, about, Story, I'm having a blast! Ever since reading about Game Dev Story in a magazine, I knew I had to get them!

occur, at, which, It's a fun game. But the frequency at which random accidents (equipment failure, power outage, etc.) occur is literally every game. At least once sometimes twice. Which makes it almost impossible to get a hall of fame game
give, for, music, I don't understand how I can get an "amazing!" Combo and my level 5 (maxxed) sound engineer only give a me 5 for music. That can't be right but I never get >10 for sound graphics etc initially
playing, on, repeat, Absolutely love this game. Been playing it on repeat for years. Fun and a great time waster. I'd love a few more updates, nothing major just another office upgrade and some new genres maybe. I'd definitely recommend the download!!

understand, at, %, The game needs an update I don't understand how an add boost at 80% fails 90% of the time that's not realistic and I have don't it over 20 time it's just point less to use in the game and also I have some high level/point on states and they contribute so little compared to some that has lower states and level other then that I like the game

played, for, hours, The game is amazing. A little short maybe in terms of story and I would definitely enjoy a lot more story but it's still amazing. I played it for 8 hours straight and never gotten bored of it. I recommend this thoroughly

stuck, on, screen, The event pops being stuck on screen for 30+ seconds are breaking the game. I click all over and no way to clear the dialog. Sometimes it's just one word to read.

played, for, years, Literally the best mobile game I have ever played, it's so cute and simplistic but also addicting and complex! It takes so long to master and understand this game, I've played it for years after buying it sometime in 2017-18 and I still just keep coming back. It's better than This War Of Mine, better than Civilization Revolution 2 and on top of that it's better than MineCraft! (But only pocket edition).

Gets, after, while, Gets kind of boring and repetitive after a while.
played, in, time, Best mobile game Ive played in a lomg time
playing, for, years, Wonderful experience with this game. I've been playing it for years and it's one of my favorites.
pay, to, balance, Fun game. Would rate 5 stars but wining the awards do not pay out to the game company's balance as indicated.
added, to, it, It is a neat and fun concept. However, the game needs more added to it as it feels half finished. It is missing more late game options. Once you get past the threshold, you are only chasing to try and get the game of the year award. Once that was achieved, I was never awarded the million dollars :(

limited, with, stamina, The game is boring and you only get a small box to look at. The "game" expects too much out of the game creations than you can afford. The workers are limited with stamina and upgrades and training workers gives massively low improvements! And their "add bonus" attempts always fail. Even at 70%

goes, on, sale, This game is so much fun. The entire thing makes sense. Genre combos that should make sense work and genre that don't make sense don't work. Along with hiring an excellent team, anyone can make a multi million hit game. So much fun. This game is out on the switch and once it goes on sale, im buying it
played, on, phone, Best game I've played on my phone!
looked, for, games, It's a great game which I enjoyed. So much so I looked for other similar games by this developer to play. My personal favourites are this and Grand Prix story. Perfectly suited for a mobile gaming experience.
play, in, landscape, Can't play in landscape. Uninstalled.
played, through, game, Possibly the most addictive mobile game I've ever played. I've played through the game three times more and it's always a ton of fun
meant, for, play, Its a classic when games were being developed. Of course the game is kinda meant for a single play through and there isnt iap. Keep in mind this game came out in 2010, a time where loot crates hadnt existed and IAP werent as required like games nowadays were Honestly people who rate it now are basing it off of 2018-present. This game is great for its time. Its an old game but one of the few i come back to time and time again.

fell, in, love, The very first Kairosoft game I played and I fell in love with it and the company. I love this game and I always will. Very simple and easy to master.
expanded, upon, mechanics, Unfortunately for this developer, the devs of Game Dev Tycoon took and expanded upon the mechanics in this game (Game Dev Story) to the point where this game seems like a cheap copy even though this game was released 8 years before Game Dev Tycoon. If this dev cares to compete with Game Dev Tycoon, they need to play that game to understand, copy, and expand upon the feature set.

beat, throughout, series, I love Kairosoft games! This was the first game I beat throughout the series. I 100% recommend it.
seem, on, score, Fun game just wish there was more info around how to assign points better when making a game cant seem to get higher than 5 or 6 on score for created game
played, for, minutes, Great concept. I'm a huge fan of these types of games, but it just didn't make the cut. I played for about 30 minutes and then uninstalled.
Update, with, content, Update the game with more content after year 20. It needs more characters, offices, advertising, game types, and events.

release, on, Android?all, Love the game but it's been years when will you guys release game dev story 2 on Android?all of these sequels but this is your best game honestly
shows, in, ways, A fantastic simulation game, the one that started Kairosoft's fame (in the US, at least)! Having played it again recently, I do notice that it shows its age in a few ways. Gameplay gets repetitive after year 15 or so (depending on the player's skill level), and once a certain amount of capital is acquired it becomes nearly impossible to lose (or get better either). That said, Kairosoft definitely hit an excellent formula here that only gets better in their later titles!

trained, in, order, I really enjoy the concept of this game - what im not a fan of is having such a small selection of possible employees, and then needing to make sure to have the right specific employees trained up specifically the right way in order to make the best games. It feels very limiting, and once I found out that I cant just build my team how I want, and with enough training make truly great games - I HAVE to get specific characters and train them in a specific way, I pretty much lost all interest.

pay, for, it, Exactly the same as Game Dev Tycoon yet worse in most aspects. But the fact you have to pay for it makes it not worth it.
takes, from, game, I love the game but I am in year 12 and every new game I make theres a blackout or something that takes nearly all of my points from the game Im making so now non e of the games i am making are good and its making me lose the game..... I can understand if there's a black out every now and then but every single game that I make.... it starting to get irritating.
enjoy, on, phone, Great game and should be celebrated for actually being a game you can buy, own and enjoy on your phone. In a sea of pay to play/win games that have infected mobile gaming this is a great example of how to do it right.
came, with, advancment, Solid fun game, however after 3 hours of play. Every game came out number #1 with no real advancment in game after you move to third office. Cute game but could be so much better

stare, at, game, So I've played this game before. It's an absolute blast. Or it would be if it even loaded. Infinite loading screens suck, and having to pay money to stare at a game that doesn't even open is essentially theft. You sold me a defective product. On top of that, I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it fixed the issue. I'm now being asked to pay twice for a piece of content I've already purchased and own. Is this legit how you treat customers?

waiting, over, years, Been waiting over 7 years for a sequel to this Amazingly addictive game. Updates need Changelogs. Where is a new game!? I don't wanna play the other games you make I'm only interested in this kind. Lowered stars because no sequel.

Played, for, hours, Great sim! Played for hours. Would love a sequel!
are, for, money, I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately it is too simple and for the same money there are other more enjoyable games.
tapping, on, screen, More mindless tapping on a screen. All these games are the same and probably contribute to the dumbing down of society.

see, to, game, Great game and very addicting. Would love to see new features to the game.
Addicting, with, life, Addicting but with a limited life.
buying, for, outages, This is a fantastic game, addictive and rewarding most times. It definitely needs a sequel! It would be great with a more detailed manual or insights into the inner workings of your choices though, and methods to mitigate frustrating rng failures (like buying a battery backup system for those power outages).
leave, like, review, This game is PHENOMENAL! Seriously it is. It's addictive too. Its such a fantastic game. One thing that would make the game better is if you could leave like a review or something for people you hire. For instance I just paid an exorbitant amount of money for someone to doy graphics and they only gave me 6 GRAPHIC POINTS! Like legit I need to do something about that guy even though he's a game character!!! Lol this game is so fun lol.

release, on, mobile, When will you release a new game on mobile?? Still playing this game after however many years and it's always the first game on a new phone.

purchased, without, advertising, They added advertisements in a payed game after being purchased without advertising, used to be good but now they just money grabbing with every release. Also some suspicious permissions required.... why does this game need my contacts phone numbers???

followed, on, it, Nearly ten years later and I still love it. Sadly kairosoft never followed up on it or made many just like it after.
play, on, phone, More than a time killer. I actually choose to play this on my phone over turning on my actual console sometimes.
buying, over, this, While it was good in its time. Its spiritual successor Game Dev TYCOON has more features and more challenging than this game. Even though the graphics are way different, I highly recommend buying that game over this. This game did not age well gameplay-wise
need, in, sequel, Exactly what we want and what we need in a sequel
spend, on, it, I love this game you can spend hours on itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
recommend, by, games, All the games this company makes are great. No mirco-tran actions or time stops, no stupid marketing tricks. Sure the free versions of the games have ads but once you buy the game they are adfree. I've been really enjoying this game dev game and like how they approached choosing generes.I also recommend the game dev game by greenheart games (pc game) totally different game but same concept. Anyway play this game if you support games without mircotranactions! â™¥
stop, on, moment, Way fun time killer. No pvp, no real time, no internet needed. Stop and start friendly. Great if you find yourself waiting around a lot. Can stop on a moment and not lose anything.
Gets, without, excitement, The touch controls are weird, but that's all kairosoft games. Gets too grindy too quickly without the same excitement of game dev tycoon.
put, into, world, Easily one of the finest games Kairosoft has ever put into the mobile gaming world.
gets, after, while, Simple to learn and a lot of fun, but it gets too easy after a while. The story timeline is 20 years (about 6hrs if you play straight through), and the first 10 years is exciting and challenging with new consoles being released at a frenetic pace, forcing you to carefully consider your budget and market share of each platform. But after 10yrs everything slows down and if you figured out 1 or 2 successful genres you can just release sequels continuously and get the same returns every time.

love, about, it, I simply love everything about it. Been a fan of the game since it released many years ago on my iPhone device, I cant even remember how I stumbled upon kairosoft but I am glad I did! Game is so unique and charming, hope for a sequel. Ps the mechanics and gameplay of 'Game Dev Tycoon' on steam is suspiciously similar, they might have been a fan!

buy, in, heartbeat, An amazing game, needs a sequel. Desperately. Seriously, please make a second one. I'll buy it in a heartbeat.
love, in, opinion, This is THE best game for any phone. The graphics are amazing, the story is great but in my opinion to short, I would love it to be longer. The mechanics of the game are the real deal of the game.
releashed, in, 1997, Fun game! Works fine. Im impressed it was releashed in 1997
Asking, for, permission, Asking for contacts permission. Why? One star until removed.
give, under, PKZ, Please make other game more cheap, give it under RM 8 PKZ
forgot, about, assignment, It's been a full year since I really play that game, now I'm ready for the actual review. Gameplay wise, this game hooked me up until I forgot about my assignment. Tons of options are shown, and the NG+ features extends this game lifespan. You can't just finish this game after 20 years, and wished to get the GOTY award. The main problem I have is how this game doesn't allow you to develop a sequel if that game doesn't make it to the hall of fame. But thanks for removing the 14 characrer limit.

fell, after, hour, This isn't a game. It's a health app. I fell asleep after 1 hour. Good job Kairosoftzzzz...
do, to, us, "Why did they do this to us!"
waited, for, Story, Iv waited years for Game Dev Story 2. Never happened. They made tons of other games. And I questioned why have they not made their own Sims(or Sims City) version type of game. Combine everything they know into one game and sell for $20 or $30 on steam, then port to mobile on later date. Update(01/22/20): another thing I love about this game compared to all their others, is no in app purchases, none whatsoever, no lame loot boxes XD

say, like, myself, This is a casual game, not for the gamers per say like myself but i sometimes find this sort of thing passes the time... which is completely ok. so if you like a casual game relax and have cup of coffee with during work break,ect this not a bad choice and bonus you pay once which good value for money if your fed up with paying tons only to be asked for more and more this is refreshing that aspect. so value is how i rate this. try it

pass, on, subway, Great simulation game! Very fun and perfect to pass the time while on the subway.

gets, with, depth, Starts out good, but gets repetitive quickly with no real depth and most of your decisions don't matter either.
play, because, it, Touch screen controls positioning not quite right with the pixl 3 xl. Couldn't play because of it. :(
come, in, honesty, Very fun, makes me happy, do buy, worth money for buy, do it, good game. Though in all honesty the change title option should come before the ship. 1 star

make, in, year, This is a great game if you like tycoon games the only issue is when you get pro devs you will make 4 games in a year with rates over 8 and no challenge at the end. Also you dont dev. Online games =(

sells, on, market, It's a game worth buying because you do have to use your head at how to make your games better over time, including if you want to make your own game system, which depending on what you put in it can cost a lot of money and is time consuming. However the more everyone in the game uses your system the more you get paid, the more you use it the more it sells on the market. I really recommend this game for everyone.

optimized, for, PH-1, Fun game but not optimized for the Essential PH-1
Add, to, it, Add more things to it please
go, in, story, Funny, but when you go deep in the story the game becames repetitive and easier.
Bought, in, 2011, Bought this in 2011 and now its saying I have to buy it again..? What the actual f.....
Play, at, pm, Play this at 9pm and before you know it, it's 3am
combined, with, two, All I need is to let AI do the job and just imagine a great title. However, some genres that need to add in such as Strategy (real time, turn based, both tactical), platform, fighting (vs or beat em up), stealth, party, visual novel. Sport game should be genre instead of type. Shooter can be First Person, Third Person, Hero, Shoot Em Up. Type that need to add in can be space combat, crime, cop, sci-fi, post apocalyptic, more vehicles etc. Both genres and types can be combined with two or more.
appealed, to, players, It was a very nice game and appealed a lot of its self to cartoony players but what i had a weird time with was the fact that thwre was nothing to do after you made hundreds of millions of dollars
payed, for, game, I like this game! but there's a unnecessary permissions, it it seems kinda wrong too, I payed for this game.
played, for, years, I've played this game for 5 years, ever since Felicia Day mentioned it in her vlog. It's worth the cost for no in app purchases whatsoever! Installed this game in over 8 phones in the last 5 years and I keep coming back to it! Just as addictive and fun as a certain monster catching game we all know and love! edit: still playing in 2019! make a sequel!

made, in, future, really good game!! But it could be made much better in the future... i would definitely recommend buying this game it really fun!
bought, for, cents, I bought this game a long time ago for 10 cents so now when I click install it pops up with another purchase menu and I try to buy it, but it says I already own this item. How do I fix this so I can play this again?

play, in, background, I love this game.....but the in game music gets obnoxious quick and even when you turn it off to play Spotify in the background the game still holds some kind of audio priority which causes Spotify to stay at a much lower volume while in the game. please fix this so I can give 5 stars!!!!!

earn, for, consoles, Wish you could have more than one console and also earn money licensing dev kits for your consoles
runs, after, update, Great all around time killer, after update, the game runs like a dream. I only wish theyd come out with a sequel or an update!

invested, in, game, i love the games you guys produce. endless time killing and decent enough mechanics to keep one well invested in the game
beaten, to, point, still the best game I still go back too I have already beaten the game to the point where I was getting the best score with like $50 million and had all the special characters but eventually got a new phone :( 10/10 even wanting to do it all again this game is addicting
get, for, instance, I have always liked your games. I would have given this one 5 stars but it seems like every time I get my stats up high like my fun or graphic for instance. the lights crash or another company is making a game similar which means I dont sale many units. I would understand if it was every once in a while but it has been every time. if I purchase a game I expect it to be fun. that isn't fun. plz fix this issue. thank u. an I will still continue to play your games
bought, on, phone, bought this app now on a different phone its trying to charge me again not happy
believe, after, years, gave it 4 stars only because after 7 years I believe the game is over, please add more to this amazing game

felt, like, rng, it felt like too much rng. the combinations that work together didn't seem obvious to me.
created, on, console, I love this game so much and it is really addictive but the reason I gave it a four star because not much to do after I created my on console and all and me making Hundreds of Millions with hall of fame games ahahah I just wish the developer can add more into it such as a bigger office upgrade and also more types of awards and maybe you can make a scene such as the gaming company itself makes its own game con and you get ti announce new games from there before selling it

changed, to, carreer, Overall, the game is good, and offers a good experience. Although, my hands shake and i have muscle spasms, so half the time, when using an item, in this instance it was a change career book, i changed to the wrong carreer when i just wanted to see how it would effect the staff member, if there was something else to confirm, insted of double tapping, it would be better for accidental taps, that in my case ended up costing me the whole game, as i was doing good until the second that book was used

invest, into, it, honestly love how the games difficult scales perfectly as you invest more time into it
Going, through, round, Going through my fourth round. Took a bit to figure out how to make a console. You just need to get a bunch of job change manuals and max everything. At least that's what I did. A few parts are a little rough around the edges, but for the most part, I'm one hundred percent satisfied.
played, on, downside, One of the best games ive ever played on my android.only downside is the screen size
has, to, effect, great concept, but the skills of your employees has little to no effect on major stages of development and is relatively pure RNG and this is terrible for this type of game. maybe if this system was fine tuned a bit more and didnt rely on manipulating save files to load right before and after huge decisions, it wouldn't have such a huge difficulty curve at the beginning. I really don't want to spen an entire hour or even more just setting up a game. Absolutely dreaded everytime I began a game.
playing, for, hours, The best Game Dev Simulator around. Been playing this for many hours already. Would really like a sequel.
farming, for, one, To hard to get software engineer spent years farming for one but still don't have one:(
finished, in, day, It's a fun game but too short imo. I've finished the game in one day and after that it just a repetitive process. Well i guess it's worth the money.
hire, from, word, This game sucks. Touch sensitivity is garbage. Could tap hire from word of mouth and it does the hire from magazine ad. Also poor ai why is the designer asking to improve the sound all the time? Really huge waste of time.
bought, in, fact, I've always loved this game bought it twice in fact .
use, at, bottom, A great game that I've been playing off and on for years. I had to take 3 planes yesterday, and this game was instrumental in helping maintain my sanity. The controls need work though. The menu touchscreen controls are offset weird, so you pretty much have to use the button controls at the bottom.
install, on, phone, Authentication problem when i install the app on two diffrent phone using the same account.Fix this my money is wasted
run, for, 20, Pretty good game loop. You run a game company for 20 in game years and try to sell the most games or consoles possible. A lot of different ways go create new games. Will probably last you about a month of playing so not too bad for the price.
selecting, on, phone, Gave 4 stars since control inaccurate on Note 9. Great game otherwise, seems to have trouble selecting the correct menu options on this phone. Keep up the good work, you guys make really fun games.
get, at, times, This is a very nice Game Dev Simulation game, the controls are bit clunky and can get annoying at times, but the overall concept and way it works is great, I suggest this to everyone who wants to try a Game Developer Simulator with simple graphics.

PUT, ON, SWITCH, PLZ PUT IT ON THE SWITCH!
coming, over, years, One of my all time favorite simulation games on the market. I find myself coming back to it over the years and I'm glad I purchased it. Once you're at the top there's not much else to do but restart with all the genres you've discovered and leveled up to see if in 20 years you can best your previous score. It's great that the game continues after 20 years but sucks that it doesn't keep track after. Either way it's a fun game that you can dedicate some time to. Hopeful for updates or a sequel.

moving, to, ads, Original is 5 stars. Why do updates require more permissions and have no patch notes? They are moving to ads and freemium games. Stay away from Kairosoft.
played, for, years, one of my favorite games on my phone I've played it for years definitely worth the cash
Move, to, card, Move to sd card then 5 stars
have, with, game, This game OBVIOUSLY deserves a sequel. The mechanics of this game felt so natural, presenting a nice challenge. This game is very engaging, putting you up against managing the creation process of a video game such as it's budget, staff productivity & skills, and pairing genres to make your game project feel unique & quality. The only gripe i have with this game is the learning curve due to poor tutorials. Otherwise it is very fun making your rag tag team of developers launch unique games.
made, to, Hall, Would love to see a 2nd edition because this game has definately made it to the Hall of Fame... Still an amazing game!
played, over, time, Ive played this game off and on over a long time and it still is really fun!
