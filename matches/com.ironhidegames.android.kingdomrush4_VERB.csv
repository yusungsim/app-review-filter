paying, for, game, The greed. Locking items behind paywalls after paying for the game. Lots of free TD games that play like this and look similar. king of defense is free with lots to do, play that instead.

went, in, direction, Being the best tower defense series on mobile, this is the light/lazy/casual version of Kingdom Rush. It is short, unpolished and unappeling. It is no surprize they went in this direction. Popularity drives many developers down the casual line. It still works okay, but there are so many cheesy elements and "surprises" that feels that they do not belong in the series. They should have focused on the old school mechanics. I finished the game in two days on veteran difficulty and will not return.

asking, for, more, I don't like how they handled the new tower upgrade system as the old system was better in my opinion. I like the variety of towers but for a paid game asking for more is a lot so I haven't used any of the paid items. I've been playing since the original kingdom rush and this one feels more focused on in game transactions than ever. also going from origins with many free heros this game only having 3 was disappointing especially after I already paid for the game.

listening, to, boom, Great game to play while listening to audio boom
choose, from, challenging, This game is great! After beating the first game, I become obsessed with kingdom rush. There the so many towers to choose from, its challenging, and I love it!
pay, for, game, You pay for this game, and it's still full of microtransactions
saw, on, store, I played the original Kingdom Rush when it first came out and as soon as I saw this on the store I bought it. The game play is smooth, lots of interesting new enemies/towers, and of course all the cool achievements you can get with clicking around the map. Its great to have another Kingdom Rush!!

go, with, guys, Great game. Can't go wrong with these guys.
feel, like, games, Good game but full of microtrandactions, doesnt feel like the original games
compared, to, installments, A bit boring compared to the previous installments but still a solid game.
get, around, one, U like tower defense ? Then u can't get around this one. I bought it and did not get disappointed, but just like playing it. I recommend it ;)
making, in, purchases, I agree this game is achievable without making in game purchases, i haven't even used gems yet either. Its a good game and I'm excited for the Shaolin forest expansion.
coming, from, someone, I've given every Kingdom Rush game 5 stars so far. What happened? This is coming from someone who's beaten the other gamers on the hardest difficulty. I have a strange feeling that the difficulty was cranked to encourage spending on micro transactions, which is a really sad thing to see. This isn't the fun kind of difficult. It feels like every tower has been nerfed, maps are balanced poorly, and enemies are badly thought out. Save your cash and buy the previous entries. They're far better.

progress, after, wave, It's a really fun game. I'm a big fan of Iron Hide games. However, this one is a bit buggy. I've had multiple levels that would progress after the final wave. It is a game breaking bug. Would by 5 stars otherwise
playing, for, years, More choice in turrets is something I always wished for, I've been playing your KR titles for years, also playing as the bad guy is cool, you have great sense of humor with all the Easter eggs and hidden jokes in the maps. Just wanna say you guys are awesome, keep making fun games. -an old fan (just wanna say maybe make premium content available if you get all stars or something, iron and heroic too, like some reward system?)

pushing, for, fixes, Nice game, but need to stop pushing out 528mb updates for small fixes.
sell, in, beginning, This is the 3rd kingdom rush game of the series that I'm playing. Everything is amazingly done. Thanks, Ironhide team for this high quality content. One thing that I did not quite understand is that in the beginning of a round before any wave you cannot sell the towers for its original cost, that's kind of annoying sometimes when you are planning your base. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose, at least in the other games of the series you could sell it for its original cost.

said, in, review, I sorry for what I said in my first review, I wasn't open minded to change. I love this game and think Ironhide made another wonderful game.
play, on, side, The game is really fun and I love how you play on the evil side, but there's one gambreaking issue and it's that my game keeps on crashing though I'm not sure of what the cause of it is
bring, into, battle, The fact that they make this game paid for and still have the heroes and towers paid for is the worst. This game is garbage. Ironhide needs to make better games than this. The whole gimick of this game is that there are more towers and you can choose what towers to bring into battle except most of them are paid for and 3 to 5 dollars each. You can only choose between 15 towers and 3 heroes unlike origins which let you choose from 5 heroes. The once you need to buy aren't even that strong. Waste$

get, to, it, It took a bit but I was finally able to open the game back up and play it,the downside is I lost all my Ingame purchases of a few towers and heroes. I love the series,but I still haven't gotten a response from the email I sent,so I hope changing the review will get some attention to it.
Paying, for, heros, If I could give no stars I would. Too expensive for a game you already have to buy. Paying for all the extra heros and towers blows.
Playing, through, time, Nothing compares. Playing it through my second time
Waiting, for, chapter, Waiting for the next chapter. 🤓
pick, before, level, Level design, animation and gameplay are all great as per the previous Kingdom Rush games. If this was a standalone game I'd probably be rating it 5. But the new tower setup really bothers me. At first it seems fun to be able to pick before each level, but you soon realise that adding this gameplay element takes away level strategy too much. Start with the wrong tower set and you'll fail no matter what.

earn, for, game, Lil disappointed that I cant earn all towers without paying for them, for a not free game it's a little stingy

playing, to, upgrade, Fun, I keep playing to full upgrade.
level, in, time, Great game great graphics but they do give the enemy the upper hand and you do not get enough coins to level up in time
feel, like, lot, I like the new additions to the game but please don't loose sight of your fans when monetizing aspects of the games. It's starting to feel like a lot.
Keep, at, it, Great variety of everything. Keep at it team.
gave, with, all, I initially gave this game 5 stars as I have with all of the prior Kingdom Rush series games. However, once you approach the end of the standard campaign, the difficulty becomes nearly impossible, especially once you try the additive campaigns. I paid for the game, but I refuse to pay more money for additional in game content. The 2 exit system on every level combined with ineffective towers and poor hero tanks make the difficulty intolerable, even on casual difficulty. I am disappointed.

jumping, from, one, The levels (design) are really stupid in comparison with the other parts, especially 1-2. Why would someone consider interesting to always have two exit points which you must defend vigorously by jumping every second from one to another. Are these levels designed to bring you joy or anxiety? Play them and answer that question for yourself.

Love, like, editions, I had purchased this game a while ago. But, started playing it a few weeks now. Love the game like the previous editions. Little bit harder to finish all 26 stages in normal difficulty level. I liked that I can choose the towers before starting the stages & selecting tower is part of the strategy. But, I could not find the Endless stage like previous edition. Is there any Endless stage?? if there is one, how do I unlock it?!

playing, for, weeks, Awesome customer support!! I love this game, but the Game erased all my progress after playing for weeks. I contacted support an they solved it immediately.
enjoyed, because, heroes, I've regret buying this game, First i enjoyed the game because of new heroes ,towers, And skills.after playing for a long time i was getting bored Other towers still needs money to use In short this game Is Pay To Win Even though you've payed for the game and unfortunately i cannot request a refund. I've requested an refund but it said that i can only refund a purchase after 7 days But i already regret buying it after 4 days . I NEED A REFUND I DEMAND A REFUND. (Edited)

played, from, hide, Great game, I've played all games from Iron hide several times through. They are the best!
prefer, in, way, Great games just like they always do. The art style is a bit different than normal. Not in a bad way I just prefer the old one.
pay, for, heroes, Great game but you need to pay more money for new heroes and towers. If you already paid for game, it is notnal to have everything unlock

add, to, game, I already finished the game and I was getting very bored, also I hope you add more towers, a larger map, more heroes, and more mercenaries. Better add more things to this game so this game gets better.
wasted, on, this, i have wasted a money on this, there's a freezing issues..iron marines and KRF worth the money..but this one is a total trash, even if you play the veteran mode it's pretty easy plus the freezing and glitch problems really annoying. would i get the refund.
choose, to, place, The only difference with this one and their other games is that you can choose 5 different towers to place on any level and they are automatically allowed to be upgraded to max level. The only complaint I have is I tried to play this on my new Samsung a12 but it keeps on freezing so I'm still playing it on on my old phone. Overall pretty fun to play as the bad guy.

purchase, in, items, The game is balanced without paying, there are tutorials how to play the game. If you like it you can purchase some in game items and you will be supporting this good game.
own, on, pc, Great game, own it on pc already. The price of the micro-transactions in comparison to the pc brings the rating down
Paid, for, game, Paid for the game to discover that there are in app purchases afterwards. What a shameful business model.

increased, with, game, I've been playing Kingdom Rush games since I was a child. The strategy, graphics, amount of content, and level of polish have only increased with each game, this one probably being the best so far. The reason I only give 4/5 stars though is because of the predatory monitization methods used in a PAID game. I know it's most likely corporate pressure that cause these changes and not the developers themselves. No hate. It doesn't matter if the game is still balanced, it's just a shame.

play, as, guys, Great tower defence series. Nice to play as the bad guys in this one. Now just need a sexy waifu version
wait, for, 😁, Very fun game! The intro screen was fixed I believe. Can't wait for the next installment 😁👍
enter, with, towers, The shallowest game of the franchise. Fun to try all the towers out but you can only enter a level with 5 chosen towers compared to the previous entries where you essentially had 8 different towers in each level. This put together with an unskippable tutorial, the stars not buying upgrades AND only 25% of the upgrades being to do with towers is very disappointing. Come on guys, bring it back for your long time fans.

comes, from, hide, Best tower defence games comes from Iron hide. Have been buying their games since 2015
buying, since, 2015, Best tower defence games comes from Iron hide. Have been buying their games since 2015
allows, for, customisation, Awesome game! Since now i could cash, buying the premium towers is so worth it. I just wish there are more towers and maybe more free heroes? Really recommend this game as the tower deck building allows for customisation although sometimes you will feel a little lost.
hold, for, players, Challenging maps early on, engaging gameplay that doesn't hold your hand too much for familiar players of the game. I like the alternate premise of the story, and the art and music is excellent! The call outs of your troops can get a tad repetitive and they are quite unpleasant in the first place. Overall a good addition to the series and I'm glad I downloaded it.
hidden, behind, paywall, Honest review. The gameplay is awesome the hidden Easter eggs in each map is also cool and the towers and heroes are unique enough that it make a difference from what you pick. The graphics are solid and the artwork is very good My problem is the fact that a major part of the enjoyment is hidden behind a 40$ paywall. I wouldn't have minded had it been 10 or 5 but 40$ to have more than 3 heroes? Or (4-8$ each) Towers you do get more option when you only buy the game but the paid ones are superior
give, due, fact, It is a solid game worth to receive 5 stars, however due to the fact that this premium gam has microtransactions for heroes, I can't give it more then 4.
improved, from, games, Very good game. And I can only recommend it if you have a bit of extra cash. Great continuation of the story, great graphics, really great gameplay. It has only improved from the last games. Keep up the great work!

All 4 Kingdom Rush franchise games, are beyond fun & actual engaging TD games loaded with HILARIOUSlY nostalgic easter egg-ish cameos from across pop culture history.

Waiting, for, legends, Waiting for legends of kingdom rush please release these are my all time favorite games
paid, for, that, Little too many paid add-ons for a game that I already paid for. But a fun tower defense.
helped, with, issues, Really fun, and the support answered quick and helped me with my issues.
spend, on, games, Amazingly awesome, just like all the previous ones :) I'm very excited to spend my money on games like this.
beat, with, resources, I liked the game alot but the thing is the first boss is insanely hard to beat with the resources you have like the beat thing you have if the dark knights and not even i can beat it so if you could make it less hard that would be good

coming, with, content, I am new to the series and I love how the developers are constantly coming up with new content. I have tried a lot of the rush games and these are some of the most entertaining.
burned, on, games, It has been a joy to spend my extra time playing this game. I burned out on TD games almost a decade ago; KR has been a welcome return to a favorite genre.
playing, since, day, I have been playing Kingdom Rush games since day one. I even was a Kickstarter for their board game. After paying 5 dollars for the latest game to see thst there was easily another 30-60$ of additional content to purchase really has left a sour taste in my mouth. I understand they are a "small dev" and I've given nothing but support to them over the years... just kind of sucks that this wasn't a free game considering the amount of dlc OR more content included in the 5$ price tag

pass, on, setting, DO NOT DOWNLOAD! No way to pass even the 3rd level on the simplest setting without paying more and more real-life money. Pay-to-play GARBAGE!!!
deal, with, them, Please add list of enemies. It really helps player to analyse the enemies power and think about how to deal with them👊👊
experience, during, gameplay, Probably my least favourite of the kingdome rush series. More pay to play features, towers have a weird range where its weird to experience during gameplay that a tower that should he within range of attack but doesn't because it's to far. But there side by side basically lol. Still fun though

play, as, character, Awesome continuation of the series. It's fun to play as a evil character for once instead of the other games where you play as a typical hero.

locked, behind, paywall, Decent addition to the franchise. Not much new from the other games, however and I don't like how some towers and heroes are locked behind a paywall.
control, from, time, Cannot control from time to time. There is a bug that I can not click sometimes.
like, as, addition, I really enjoy this game. The only thing I would like as an addition is a fast forward button because sometimes the rounds take a long time. 15 round stages could be A lot faster if I could fast forward the first 7 waves until the little more intense ones pop up in half the time. I mostly play this on my break at work and you can only do so much in 30-45 minutes

coming, to, time, I've played every kingdom rush game and this one has to be my favorite. The map is great looking, I love all the secrets, and I find myself coming back from time to time just to enjoy it over and over again. Definitely deserves 5 stars
charges, for, game, This is the worst version of KR ive played. It now charges for the inital game AND heroes AND towers! The animations aren't as good as previous installments. You cant sell towers for their full price during inital level setup. Theres a long list of small things that make this game bad. Play the other KR games instead if you haven't.

add, for, challenge, Fun game. Love all of them. Dope art style. cool upgrades for towers. Normal mode is difficult enough to be a good time killer, but all the bonus modes add for good replay challenge.
hidden, behind, wall, Purchased the game but a lot of locked content hidden behind a pay wall. I'm an early adopter and have purchased all previous games before they were for free. In past versions, you had access to more champions and the full spectrum of towers. Unfortunately, the feeling I'm getting is that they delivered the least amount for the most they can get away with. Really disappointed with this one. Also, looking at other reviews, many of people are saying the same thing - listen to your consumer base!

pay, for, goodies, Game is good but not as much as kingdom rush. Uneven levels and they want you to pay for goodies. Shouldn't have in app purchases when you have to pay for the game.

optimized, for, device, Game is not optimized for modern device with ultra widescreen display, you will lose anywhere from 13-15% vertical field of view compare to standard 16:9 display, what's more disappointing is that I bought this concern to the developer yet I was told the game was fine as the way it is even though all of the previous Kingdom Rush games got update with ultra widescreen fully supported.

reduced, by, %, Why is the latest installment of Kingdom Rush lack of ultra widescreen support on mobile devices, unlike previous Kingdom Rush games it got update to fully utilized ultra widescreen. KR Vengeance when play my Galaxy S8, it reduced vectical field of view by 15%.
miss, at, defenders, Too difficult. 5 minute placing towers and 20 minute-long mission only to miss some sneaky guy at the end ignore defenders and run by? And have to start all the way from beginning? It's bad game design, it's just frustrating and not fun. Maybe checkpoints of something would fix that, but right now I gave up on level 4 after restarting it like 15 times.

Love, since, rush, Love it since the first kingdom rush, their graphics and playing is simple and great 👍🏼👍🏼
zoom, in, play, Please update for Capability to zoom in and zoom out in game play.
stuck, in, screen, Currently, the game needs to be opened twice before it can be played. I'm using Poco F2 Pro. If I don't do that, the game just stuck in a black screen. I hope the devs will fix this issue.
paying, for, game, Worst of the series, by far. After paying for the game, they gate half the towers behind real money. Save your money.
paid, for, back, Great game! If I could get the content I paid twenty dollars for back that would be great though... It's been a long time now actually. Over a year. Still waiting on the purchase to be fixed because I have a record of paying for it, but it's gone.

upgrading, throughout, level, Very engaging. It is not a pay to win game. You are constantly upgrading throughout each level. Not just placing your towers and waiting for the wave to end.
bring, to, level, Great addition to the KR franchise, i'm really liking the new mechanic wehre you can choose what tower you bring to each level, it's pretty short lengthwise, even for a kingdom rush game. Most of the towers are locked behind paywall, while you don't need them to finish the game it still sucks to not be able to experience the full game, i'd really like it if we can grind for currency to get the towers

appreciate, before, one, Maybe the worst kingdom rush since the original, the balance is way worst than the other games. I still buy all the heroes and Tower just to appreciate the game before this one. Hope you guys make another great game. 😊 Oh... And the game have issues with the constant black screen, after you switch the app to other app, so you need to close and open it again to fix this.

requires, in, purchases, Decent simple defence tower game.Highly monetised & requires in game purchases after having already bought the game... The reply below is disingenuous as best given the in game purchase charge levels. Sold as a premium game in reality this is a money grabbing freemium model with *huge* additional changes if you actually want to play effectively. Eg all but 3 heroes locked behind a paywall.

acts, like, upgrade, Another excellent tower defence game made by ironhide! Addicting but not much to expect once you complete it. I have some suggestion tweaks: buff darknights when shield is active it will still pick an enemy if current is killed and hp regen when shield is active, cheaper instakill price. buff mortemis zombies max numbers. NEW tower: a barrack tower that solely acts like the "walking dead" upgrade of bone flingers. Sandbox and endless mode for EVERY level after you complete it.
playing, for, years, It's an amazing game, good to play whenever you want. I have been playing it for years and always come back to playing. 5 stars easy.
noticed, off, bat, Purchased game recently, very polished looking and the new additions are great (towers, heroes, power ups) as well as the switch from good side to evil side. BUT while good in these ways, there are glaring bugs that are noticed right off the bat, one being missing sfx sounds, and another being missing names for barracks soldiers. (There names instead are whatever you last clicked). I've tried restarting phone, reinstalling game, no fix. Without bugs this is a 5/5.
appreciate, As, fan, Delightful gameplay. There is a Deep Ones tower. As a fan of HP Lovecraft I appreciate that. Plus I love all the movie and shows references you find throughout the game. Darkness has a particular esthetic I appreciate and this game carries it well in a cartoony way.

starts, from, beginning, Changing my review. Had almost completed all levels and then suddenly the campaign starts from the beginning. Crazy.
freezing, at, end, A fun challenging tower defence game but let down by the game randomly freezing at the end of a level, forcing you to redo it again. You also get hounded to leave a review
expect, from, Rush, Fun game that you expect from Kingdom Rush but why is the Encyclopedia of enemies and towers not included in the mobile version? Feels like a weird thing to omit.. Updated to 4 stars. Why not 5? Missing encyclopedia and it's a shorter game from the other Kingdom Rush games..

going, from, veriety, With a heavily reduced selection of towers per level (going from a veriety of 8 to a max variety per level of 5) this newest addition to their series had a rocky start. I played through it anyway and behold, more than half of their towers are locked behind a paywall as a "dlc" despite never having done this before. To make matters worse, the towers you pay for are CLEARLY better than the free ones, and give you such an advantage you almost need them to beat many of the levels on hard.

hyped, for, it, I have played every single kingdom rush game including iron marines and still dissappointed that you did not give android the legends of kingdom rush i was hyped for it and you ruined it for me
swap, at, disposal, Very good game. Ironhide did a supreme job making this, the ability to swap out the type of towers at you disposal keeps the game intersting and fun all the way through. The art is absolutly wonderful, bight and new, while also not betraying that classic kingdom rush style. I will, however, say it is a little wierd to be playing as the BBEG from the first game

spend, to, unlock, Nice game but a LOT of stuff is locked. You buy a premium game but only three base heroes are unlocked and about half the towers. The rest you have to spend like 3€ each to unlock. I really don't recommend unless you spend other 20€ or so. Disappointing and greedy, completely ruined my experience.
paying, for, game, If I'm paying for a game I expect to have a full game. You need to pay to unlock towers.

playing, for, years, Been playing iron hide's games for years and loved every single one. They're very well thought out games and perfect for casual and hardcore playthroughs
pay, for, towers, Pay a premium to buy the game, then you need to pay additional money for the best towers in this tower defence game. Something I would expect from a free game.

play, as, guys, Very good game with lots of fun to be had, and you grt to play as the bad guys in this one so it's a good change from the last kr games
Paywalled, on, game, Paywalled towers on an already $5 game is rough. Love the game, but for $40 for full content of heroes and towers I expect a much much longer campaign.
play, as, game, So happy to see this franchise still going . I remember the days when i used to play this as browser game , great game devs as always on point 👌
Played, via, pass, Played via the Google play pass. Definitely a great edition to ironhide's TD games. Wish there was a 2x speed button though. Still great regardless!
played, on, phone, One of my favorite games iv ever played on my phone!
wait, for, part, If you love Tower defence, Buy this game! The developers are always upping their game and giving us quality games. I 100% recommend all 4 entries in this series. I can't wait for part 5 :D Enjoy!!
unequip, into, loadout, i enjoy the idea of having different towers that you can equip and unequip into the loadout. it brings alot more variety to this game in comparison to previous kingdom rush games. although it is a good addition i dont think these certain towers should be available for purchase. i would much rather have additional challenges or achievement rewards give the extra towers so you dont have to pay for extra towers to use and just leave the heroes purchasable instead.

put, to, edge, The myth, The Man, The legend. That's what I'm thinking when I see this bad boy return to reclaim the world, this game will put your mind to the edge to finish every single level, but it's quite a downgrade especially with the towers where you need to buy unique towers and the perks leveling are less than kingdom rush before this.
start, on, galaxy, Excellent game however I often with a black screen on app start up on galaxy 21 +
Thank, at, Ironhide, Legitimately one of the best available tower defense games! Slight changes in terms of tower progression, but I'm actually beginning to prefer it compared to previous titled. Although microtransactions exist, the game is still very playable without spending any money, it's mainly for specialized heroes, but vanilla heroes are great all the way through late game. Overall, excellent title from a fantastic series. Thank you all at Ironhide, and keep up the great work !!
LOVE, Besides, button, This is a great defense game. No ads and there are upgrades. The game is a slow paced time waster. Besides a speed button, I would LOVE to know how many kills a tower has. But other than that, another great game from ironhide.
Hurray, for, guy, Hurray for the bad guy
wanting, for, which, The game is really hard like really really hard but once you beat the sixth level it gets way better you unlock the Dark Knight which I've been wanting for a while I just got them actually. There is also a ton of interactive things on levels like on level six if you go to a lava pool you can see a Terminator reference and also a Simpson one and a different level.

play, from, beginning, Yes team thanks for getting back to me. I don't really mind downloading again, it just means I have to play it from the beginning again. Anyway, with this game. I LOVED it as I do the other Kingdom Rush games. Feel dumb coz I only just realised I'm playing on the villain's side 😅 and I was thinking the whole game that damn the opposition looks like the good guys on the other games and then I read the title Vengeance....yes makes sense 🤦‍♀️I enjoyed it, my kids now enjoy it too on their ipads!

asking, for, date, The game is repeatedly logging me out of Google Play, so losing my saved position, and asking for my date of birth. Also, all sound has vanished. I'M ON THE LATEST VERSION, NO UPDATE AVAILABLE.

play, on, mode, The free games from ironhide are better then this, i dont recommend, you cannot choose the game speed which makes it annoying, so basically you play on slow mode, the cash you get from killing enemies on each lvl.is too low to properly upgrade towers on time so normal lvl is actually difficult to pass with 3 stars, only have 3 free heroes while the free games you get the least the option to get free 6 heroes...other ironhide games outclass this...

is, after, update, The game is great but there is no sfx audio after the last update. Please fix
thinking, about, it, After thinking about it, 3 stars is to harsh. The game is great, just the weakest of the kingdom rush games imo. I feel like the tower variety suffered a lot due to the limited selection during a game and general balancing. After unlocking the bone throwers and mausoleum, I found myself not using anything else due to them being both good dps and great blocking towers. I definitely preferred to older style where each tower has a set of very distinct upgrade paths.

used, to, it, I've bought every Kindom Rush game and this is my favorite one. When i first got this game it seemed a little weird because It was a little slow but then I got used to it and now I love it. They replaced using your stars to buy stuff to getting souls and you can upgrade a bunch of things. And sadly they removed the feature to use the book to look what types of enimes there are. But other than that you should definitely buy this game. Super fun.
force, into, melee, Unfortunately I can't refund anymore, but after giving it a hard play I just give up. This should be a free to play game since there's blatant ftp mechanics. Locked heroes, towers, and abilities. This is grotesquely greedy. The levels aren't very well designed and the heroes are even worse, such as the free ranger character. You have to force a RANGED hero into melee to use their strongest ability. The other heros and towers should be unlockable through gems like previous games, awful pay to win
played, in, years, Probably the best TD game I've played in years. A few bucks for hours of months of entertainment? Deal
played, from, developer, I've played another game from the same developer - it's also called Kingdom rush something. And it's was a decent game until about a dozen levels later there's enemies that freeze or lock your towers and the only way to unlock these is to click multiple times on each. Same here. This needless clicking completely breaks gameplay for me and turns what is otherwise is a pretty good tower defense game into another unplayable silly clicker.

sooo, along, way, been playing these games since they launched on kongregate and still my all time favorite game series to this date. from the music and the voice talent, graphics to story line. and sooo many easter eggs along the way! these games never have gotten old and never will kerp up the amazing work IronHide or as shatra would say Edih Nori!
refuses, On, phone, It's unacceptably buggy. On a modern phone (S10+) it refuses to open and gets stuck on black screen half the time, and now SFX sound completely died and does not work anymore no matter what I do. The animations and game as a whole feels choppier and less smooth than the previous ones. Same gameplay, but the overall experience is significantly inferior. Not to mention it's way more in your face with all the microtransactions.

buy, after, time, Are you kidding me Ironhide?! I buy this game after all this time to be met with more micro transactions and hero purchasing?! I was fine with that ton your free games but this...this is too far. Other than that detail, the game plays pretty good and I enjoy it.

came, to, mobile, KR has always been special I've been paying since before they came to mobile, this installment in great I love the variety of towers and your ability to customize your loadout is sick. There's a bunch of towers and heros that I think would be really cool to be able to trial run/test for free before committing to buying, I think it would help me make the jump to potentially getting them permanently. Also I miss the encyclopedia out was just really cool to be able to see the whole worlds stats.

paying, for, game, Frustrating that there are so many in game additional purchases after paying for the game.
pay, for, game, You pay for a premium game and get a freemium game. Towers and heroes are locked behid a paywall. Also the pop-up asking to rate the game is verry aggresive. I still enjoy the game despite all this. The story is ok and the gameplay is great. I feel though that this game is a step down from the previous Kingdom Rush games. The frequent freezes and now the bug that removes the sfx are ruining the experience.

helped, with, strategizing, Like all kingdom rush games, this is fantastic, great graphics, features etc. I wish that you still had the encyclopedia, that really helped with strategizing and it was also fun to collect all the enemies as you went along. I do miss being able to use the stars for upgrades, I feel that there is less motivation to move through the levels. Any glitches/bugs I've had in the game have been fixed with Ironhide getting onto the problem quickly. 4.5 stars🤩

paying, for, it, Good game. After paying for it I am pretty disappointed that more than half the towers and characters are behind a considerable pay-wall. Seems greedy to me. Hmmm, enjoying the game in its entirety but having hero's and towers behind a pay wall. I don't see how that tallies.

paying, for, heroes, Great game all around. Can play casual or challenging. Not really a fan of paying extra for different heroes or towers tho
keeps, from, stars, This is the best one in my opinion mainly because you get the most tower variety. It is a little short though. And the lack of an endless mode or something keeps it from 5 stars.
crashes, during, level, Game crashes during last level of the kingdom area right before the end so I can't progress the game.

compared, to, games-, Three free heroes is too small a roster. Difficulty of the levels beyond the campaign no longer feels justified compared to previous games- there was always a way, but it was possible. Now, you NEED to spend money to buy the inventory items- or these additional levels are impossible, even with the premium content towers. And again ... THREE free heroes?!? Ironhide, what the eff???
balancing, for, imo, Game needs some balancing for the towere imo. Level 1 towers are basically worthless, and you have to build tall instead of wide in order to succeed.

unlocked, through, pass, An all-time fan of the franchise, I am not disappointed by this installment of Kingdom Rush. With all options unlocked through the Google Play pass, the game offers a good variety of towers, levels and heroes. Not sure what the other versions are worth though!

worked, through, games, So good. I've been a big fan since the first one came out online. Just worked my way through the previous 3 games which is a must due to the storyline. All of their games are good but they've outdone themselves with this one 👍🏻

locks, behind, paywall, It is very fun though I don't like how it locks some very cool heroes and towers behind a paywall.
finished, with, game, I am just about finished with this game. It's great. Another amazing game from Ironhide. Love the Kingdom Rush games. If you like active tower defenses this game is great
lower, for, money, Really great entry into the series, definitely worth it for the price. The only downside is that a lot of the (granted, optional) towers and heroes are locked being paywalls which lower the value for money. You don't need them, but would be nice not to have to inflate the cost of the game for some interesting looking mechanics.

did, with, frontiers, The game was very smooth and very fresh and to play as the villains was a really good idea but I would make one of the bought hero's free like you did with frontiers and origins as well as make some things a tad bit cheaper and to add some kind of survival just like the last three games because that is something that is dearly missing

started, at, 2016, Back to edit my reviews cus last time was in 2018 or 2019 or somethin but i started at 2016 , i now have finished the entirety of this series, played every single game , played all hardcore stages ,for 4 years ive came into the conclusion that ironhide....ur the best , cant thank you enough that you are the reason i passed highschool ,thanks to the devs and mods for everything they've created

locked, behind, IAPs, Fun game, but too many heroes and towers are locked behind expensive IAPs.
get, into, level, I bought it recently and was really excited. Unfortunately, the game is nearly unplayable. After every level and almost every time I launch the game it crashes. My progress has been reset twice already and I've only had it a few days. However, when I do manage to get into a level it runs perfectly and is super fun. Just so frustrating getting to that part. Help would be appreciated. Update: Been a good few months now and even though I've been emailing with support they've still not fixed it.

need, For, those, I bought this app because...well I buy all their apps. It was slightly different than my favorite (Frontiers) so I shelved it. Decided the time had arrived to play it. Sooooo friggin' good! For those of you wondering, as usual you don't need a red penny beyond buying the game to beat it. If you want world domination quickly then sure buy the heroes, but it always comes down to the choices you make re:- towers etc. No scam here...fun,fun,fun!

compare, with, games, It's hard to compare this with the other kingdom rush games, but its becoming one of my favorites. The only downside is no enemy encyclopedia. It's very different than the other ones, but I enjoy that they tried something new!
used, in, chapter, best series among the other kingdom rush series. but still, barracks performance is not as high as their cost making them rarely used especially in additional chapter i would recommend for the devs to lower barracks tower price in the next update or next series so barracks tower will more used

load, in, while, Once in a while game will not load, but reloading the game works. I like how smooth the game play is. I will update as I go through and build game time.
buying, at, time, Game costs $50 not $5. $5 unlocks some small fraction of gameplay. Seriously chalk full of extremely expensive content. I'm so sick of piece meal gaming buying one charter or tower at a time. It is like you really just buy a trial version. Just make a full game that isn't pay to play and then be honest up front that your grubby company want $100 for the game.
put, into, game, Honestly had the most fun out of all the games u have a wide variety of towers and different possibilities of strategy, they put good work into this game and I loved it.
need, on, top, Really dont like the fact that you need to buy the game and on top you need to buy extras seperately. =\ very bad move by dev
put, on, ipad, I've beat all four games and iron marines and they all slap. I hope that they make more and put it all on ipad
looking, for, game, 5 stars for me! They make the best tower defense games in the market! Always looking forward for the next game
unlock, through, playtime, Amazing game. My only complaint is I think there should be a way to unlock all the towers and heroes through playtime. It can be really hard but it should be possible.
played, in, time, Possibly the best tower defense game I've played in a long time, quite challenging and alot of different enemies to keep you on your toes.

enjoy, because, twist, These games always run smooth. I really enjoy this one in particular because of the story twist but also the ability to choose which towers to use each time.
gave, in, one, Kingdom rush all serie are good including this one but they only gave 3 free heros in this one and its kinda disappointing
is, at, level, There is a bug in the game at the last level of ice when i reach the round 15 and finish the game still moving but no victory displays on the screen and still cant pass the level
had, worth, money, nice game had a lot of links to the original game worth the money
began, with, rush, Once again ironhide studios has released a first rate tower defense game. It continues the saga began with kingdom rush . Good playability and plenty of suprises!
designed, for, phones, The form factor of the screen is not really designed for smart phones and therefore one can only see half of the game during gameplay.

Sticking, to, art, The best one out of the series tbh. Sticking to their game art and play style but added unique and game changing adjustements compared to the other 3 series of the game. This one tops the others. Just like the other ones. No pay to win. Love the story line. Amazing game overall. Just sometimes crashes.

waiting, for, version, I really like it, I just don't like that you usually only have one hero, and that it costs extra money to get the better heroes and towers. I am waiting for the switch version where it is all paid for at once for a lower cost. On the upside, the customization of which towers to use is new and pretty cool. I am still only on level 5 though so time will tell if the earlier towers become too weak to do much and you have to only select the later ones. So far, I really like it. The story is fun.

beat, on, mode, This game is like Dark Souls! Not the fun DS experience but a frustrating one. I played all KR games, because it's my fav series, and I will admit that I can't beat any of them on hard mode but the normal dificulty on this is just as punishing. What the heck? Tone down the difficulty a bit, I repeat, Normal mode is too hard.
entertain, for, awhile, Solid game that can entertain you for awhile, tech tree forgiving and has free resets.
compared, to, versions, Money grubbing game compared to the older much better versions. Doesn't matter how well you do in the game anymore... Skill points don't come from achievement stars.. They just push you through the game and push in-game purchases to unlock content you already paid for. There's no incentive to go through the hard mode or iron fist mode anymore. Simply not as fun as the older versions. Good story and stuff but really leaves an empty feeling as you play.. Not as rewarding nor fun as the older ones

play, for, beginners, The Kingdom Rush series are the best tower defense games on the market. It's hands down the best experience out there for phones. No adds. Great challenge for experienced players and easy to play for beginners. Good graphics, many levels to beat and various towers to build. Well worth it. You can buy extra towers and heroes in the game but it is not needed to beat the game.

caught, in, it, I've played a lot of castle defense and this might be in my top 3. It's fun and the only complaint I have is I sometimes get to caught up in it. Kingdom rush has done it again.
manage, with, towers, Better than expected despite what some YouTube reviewers said. Not as good as Origins, but definitely better than Frontiers with far better graphics too... Yes there are pay to win towers but that's just for those who can't basically manage the game with basic towers.
compared, to, games, shorter and dumbed down compared to previous two games... Upgraded to 4 stars. I just like this game. I wish the upgrade system was a little more expanded and there were real numbers on everything.. but it is so fun.

zoomed, in, way, Other 3 let you zoom in and out this one is zoomed in way to far and won't let you zoom out to see the whole map! But in Ironhide tradition game start good they get you money and stop caring about the game and you!!

root, for, heros, I loved this game so much! The genius writing and story making has left me speechless! You feel compelled to root for the heros you know and love but you also want to root for Vez'nan. The only thing that kept this from five stars is that for the most expensive game in the series you don't get acess to all the towers, and I'm not a big fan of the new tower mechanic. They also got rid of the encyclopedia and endless levels. But other than those two things this game is beautiful and worth the buy!

played, through, games, Kingdom Rush fans will enjoy. I've played through all the Kingdom Rush games and I have always liked the genre. This is no exception. The tower variance is better than the other games in the series, as well as how to utilize them.
Pay, for, towers, Not up to the standard of other KR games. Pay $$ for towers, talent tree not as thought out, no incentive for heroic mode. Practically a Gacha game, there are so many pay to win mechanics added.
add, to, experience, Great tower defense game, quite challenging. Lovely graphics and a nice sense of humour add to the play experience.
bring, into, stage, So Vengeance is definitely different from the rest of the series. You no longer get stars for doing iron and elite stages. The upgrade system has been redone. The towers are different, by not giving you a second option of the final upgrade. Instead you choose up to 5 towers to bring into the stage with you and there's good variety for it. Other than those major changes, it's the same formula with playing as vez' nan. I still love the series and am glad they're trying new things

play, as, general, Great game, love being able to play as Vez'nan's general,but the microtransactions and the single profile slots are a bit annoying.
reduced, in, account, I have a purchased hero but the transaction failed, but it still reduced my money in account. I have documents that i didn't recieved the hero and requeating for a refund

put, into, one, Not as good as the previous kingdom rush games, you can tell they put less effort into this one.
Feels, like, game, Feels like a PC game. No ads, no pay wall.
limited, to, tree, Ok do the game is good but it's not as good as the previous ones. The level design are well done. The monetization has been better, but is understandable. Main problem with the game is the way they redid the tower system. Monetization aside it's limited to one tree per tower, severely limiting your options from 8 in the previous games to 5. It gives less freedom and limits the options for enjoying the game. Tower levels 1-3 are basically the same so the uniqueness is cool but pointless.

show, in, history, I would give it 5 stars but idk why i have to Re purchase i got this a couple years ago doesnt even show in my payment history.
slap, like, ones, The latest installment from my favorite mobile franchise, it doesn't slap me like the earlier ones but it's still fun nevertheless.
go, For, Reason, Hey I was rrally loving this Game Even spent Some money to Buy some towers, and For some Reason Today I go to log on and Everything Is Rest back to start. I have no more Towers or Heroes. Please fix this, Edited: Also I Have Payed for 2 Towers And Only 1 Is Popping Up.

put, for, description, Should have not remove the description of the enemy unit. should have put the books for description like from the previous frontier games, the encyclopedia. could have been better for paid game. More stages & less paid heros & towers.

starting, as, knights, Love it!!!! Miss starting as knights but very fun!!
says, In, description, A warning to others = In the description it says "13 powerful heroes" so me paying for a game just assumed that I would get said heroes but no, you get 3 and have to pay for the rest...the same goes for the towers,you only get about half. Maybe add this in the description? The game has a shocking amount of in game purchases.

taping, on, troop, The best Kingdom Rush game I played. Although there are a few bugs like taping on a troop has its name glitchy or copies a tower name. Overall, this game is very good
start, on, Pixel, Solid TD, first in the series I've enjoyed enough to play through. Purchased a tower, not really OP at all. Only gripe is that on my Google Pixel 5 it doesn't start immediately, I need to switch out of the app and go back for it to load.
spend, on, them, No one makes better tower defense games than Ironhide and they worth every penny you spend on them.
freezes, on, Note, Fun game, but too many bugs. It freezes a lot on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ phone. I closed the app and opened it back up, but it doesn't start up still. I restarted my phone, but that didn't work either. It also won't stop bugging me about a review.

looking, at, games, Great fun, best tower defence game out. I recommend looking at their other games if you enjoy this one.
pay, for, lot, Really sucks that you still need to pay for a lot of content even after purchasing the game. Edit... You only have access to half the towers if you BUY the game. Usually they just limit your access to heroes but in this one they really gave you 3 heroes out of like 12 and HALF the towers. Heard they were releasing a new Kingdom Rush soon. I'm not buying it unless it's fair. Like do they actually think their little game is worth 50$ CAD if you want access to all the content?

win, in, app, Refunded due to the many pay to win options present in an already pricey app. You have to pay for towers, heroes, AND items. It is ridiculous.

love, in, game, I love this franchise and in this newest game you play as the bad guys rather then the humans. I'm really enjoying it so far.

come, with, hero, I totally love this kind of game tower Defense. I've played all the Ironhide developer game. Especially this type of TD all Kingdom rush from the beginning its created. Hopefully the story and the new storyline will come out with a new hero and tower. Better make a new one after this vengeance.
stuck, at, start, Always black screen when opening the game. Always have to open it twice. And sometimes the loading screen is stuck. And at the start of gameplay when you're going to build a tower, the screen is stuck again...
entering, for, time, The cutscenes before you enter a match get annoying when you're restarting and not entering it for the first time. The game also crashes from time to time. As for balancing, the game seems less balanced than the previous ones. The heroes seem to die too easily to dangerous threats, such as the armored polar bear or the dwarves' mechs. There's an excessive amount of ranged enemies at times. And lastly, some towers seem like they don't synergize well in any tower sets/loadouts.

play, as, Forces, Difference in this game is that you play as the Forces of Vez'nan against the Allied kingdoms from the first game. Instead of choosing a spec on level 3->4, all towers now upgrade to level 4. As you progress, you unlock new towers which you can swap out with the base 4 you are given. Some of the other reviews are saying that of course the paid towers are imbalanced, but thats expected and ive made good progress without any tower purchases. 7/10 i dont like the art style on the comic strips now

had, After, game, After every other Kingdom Rush game I had high hopes. Unfortunately this game was my least favorite. Still no enemy encyclopedia, and no real reason to complete every level beyond the first play through other than the normal campaign. And I know how much effort a static picture with some text in a game takes. Minimal at most. Just lazy game design and imo truly leaving behind the best parts of the first 3. Mediocre compared to the original. Better art and graphic design doesn't make a bettergame

Holds, to, standards, Holds up to the previous games standards and then some.
play, on, veteran, Simple easy control but hard if you play on veteran. Edit ever since the update the game get's easy every time with new hero before the hero and tower update it was hard beacuse you can't just spam tower now you can with in game bought tower though there are some lvl that are good.

strive, for, what, Absolutely excellent. This is what mobile games should strive for.
lack, as, games, My phone updating apparently deleted my save, and tbh the game wasn't nearly as challenging nor as fun as it's predecessors. Interesting new mechanics in terms of enemies, and towers, but...just seems to lack the same level of fun as the games that came before.
are, like, games, The game itself is amazing. In some small ways, it isn't quite as good as the previous three games (no encyclopedia, waves are slightly slower) but none of these are nearly severe enough to prevent me giving it 5 stars. There are micro-transactions, like the previous games, and, like those games, you don't need them to complete the game. The customer service is also amazing: a few days ago I lost my save progress: the helpful staff who I contacted restored it a few days later.

get, to, imposdibke, Its fun. Hard level is impossible cant even get to the imposdibke kevel itself. So challenging if not frusttstinh
like, on, difficulties, It's good. But ingame purchases are unnecessary and too much pay-to-win. I don't like even having the temptation to cheat, especially on the harder difficulties. I like to know the game was designed to be besten without such crutches at every difficulty level.

focus, on, enemy, Pros: -Game is good difficulty is right. -Game has a lot of towers. Cons: -No speedup button. -No priority target to focus on specific enemy. -Too much heroes to buy with real money. -Buy potions with gems but gems are rare... -Some minor info about each enemy or tower is not dispalyed for example attacks per second or dodge rate

experiment, with, setups, And fun and interesting new addition the the Kingdom Rush franchise that finally allows you experiment with diverse tower setups for new strategies and themed builds to utilize! An excellent game.

beat, in, legendary, Honestly I hope u make more levels I beat the game in legendary
compared, to, ones, I actually really enjoy a lot of the newest twists this game has to offer compared to the previous ones, i hope iron hide makes more heroes, towers, and levels in the future.
work, on, book, Sadly doesn't work on my Acer 514 Chrome book. Back to frontiers and Iron Marines for me!
plays, like, KRs, The game plays very much like previous KRs, so if you liked those, you'll like this one. There's a few changes to the formula I'm not a fan of (individual towers with "premium" towers) but that's mostly taste. Not mine, maybe yours. The reason I'm giving this game three stars is because there's some incomprehensible regressions compared to previous KRs. No monster encyclopedia anywhere(!!!), selling towers before round 1 doesn't refund 100%, more & slower loading screens... Pass until fixed.

expected, to, rush, not as expected to other rush i am not impressed this time
work, on, Chromebook, I love this game. Just wish it would work on my Chromebook like the other kingdom rush games. 👍👍😁

buy, on, Steam, It only costs less than 20 dollars to buy this game inclusive of all heroes and towers on Steam. This mobile version is simply a rip-off.
purchase, in, game, I've played all of the kingdom rush games, and this one is the best. Graphics are great, gameplay is awesome, and I love how you can have a loadout of different types of towers each round. This game has inspired me to draw and maybe make a video game like this one day. It is a very good game not many things that you have to purchase in the game. In my opinion the kingdom rushes go in this order, kingdom rush vengeance, kingdom rush the original, kingdom rush origins, kingdom rush frontiers.

love, for, graphics, I have been a big big fan of the series since 2013. I really love kingdom rush vengeance specially for the graphics and newly designed interface. The difference can be seen between the previous versions of this game. Thanks for releasing this part as well. I hope to see another one very soon.

open, without, paywall, Could open more heros without paywall
playing, for, months, I love this game been playing for six months it's easy to understand And fun to play and I love the heroes and upgrading system
Dropping, to, stars, Great game. Similar enough to predecessors in the series that you can pick it right up. Lots of little details that make a complete experience. So far, I haven't felt the need to make additional purchases. Update: Dropping this to 2 stars. Hit a wall that I can't get past without in app purchase. That wouldn't be so bad if it were free. But I've already paid for it. shame.
compared, to, game, Disappointing compared to original game, especially given cost and in app purchases.
compared, given, cost, Disappointing compared to original game, especially given cost and in app purchases.
have, in, installments, Another solid follow up to this series! But now that I have finished it, a few nitpicking things. First, after you complete the game you unlock the impossible difficulty. But there is no achievement listed for completing them, and each location icon doesn't update to show anything special for completing it on impossible. I would love to have an enemy index for each enemy type like in prior installments, and maybe a kill count indicator for each type. I would love mission expansion update too!
Recommend, on, go, Great game! Recommend on the go!
lacked, in, maps, Great graphic improvements and more variety of towers over the last Kingdom Rush games but I couldn't help but feel it lacked a lot in actual maps and content. I'm not sure if its the layout of some of the maps, or the lack of enemy waves but I found myself not enjoying it in a lot of places and only filling 25% to 50% of the available tower slots before the level was over. No endless mode here which reduces replayability also.

came, on, computer, I remember playing the first one when it came out on my computer and absolutely loving it and when origins, frontiers and this one went on sale I bought them and played through all of them its nice to come back to this game every once and a while always a good time

expect, from, game, Fantastic! Simply the best TD game I've played. It delivers exactly what you want and expect from a TD game plus the gorgeous art and witty charm. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another TD game put into the android library. This game knocks its rivals into the stratosphere, irrelevant of the platform. It does have in-game purchases but you genuinely don't need to pay to win. Although, I made just one additional purchase of a cool dragon hero, but only because I like dragons!

brings, from, game, I've only played a couple games but it is a great game so far and brings some memories from the original game which I love
compared, to, one, nothing like the other kingdom rushes. good graphics but i enjoyed how original and unique the other kingdom rushes were compared to this one. this one feels like a cash grab and its just not better than the older versions. if youre looking to play through all the kingdom rushs, this one by far is the least enjoyable. and thats sad to say cus i played kingdom rush when it first came out on kongregate.

faced, In, hour, In my first hour of playing i have faced game freeze bug twice... it's horrible i am doing a refund
finish, without, them, This is a very solid TD game. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics are really nice. There are paid towers and heroes which are cool but they're optional, I can finish the game without them.
Played, on, pass, Played on the Google subscription pass and was great. Decided to buy the game after the month trial ended and now half the towers / characters I was using are locked behind extra paywalls now. Which is such a scam!! It also won't let me get a refund for some reason either...

pay, for, most, It's really good, but annoying how you have to pay for most of the hero's and towers with real money when this is a payed game anyways.
stuck, behind, paywall, Some of the best towers and heroes are stuck behind a paywall, in this case i bought what i wanted... i think it was worth it. Do not buy the goblin balloon tower, while flavorful, it sucks, and it feels bad to drop a tower you paid for lol. The doom tank is a great hero, i recommend it. The lazer tower and fishman tower are quite fun, i recommend those as well.

pay, for, game, Some how i need to pay for this game again? I already paid before
paying, for, it, I love the game it's really fun but I have a problem. I accidentally uninstalled the game while trying to free some space but when I reinstalled all my progress was still there but my purchases are gone and there is no way in hell I'm paying for it again so a little help we be very appreciative. Edit: almost all my progress was saved some of my heros were at lower levels and some levels had lower stars.
see, in, stage, Average game for the series, unfortunately they used cheap gimmicks like 'white out' storms to make the map hard to see in later stage. It made it annoying, therefore difficult vs well thought out enemy groups and difficult. The latter is fun to overcome, the former is just trashy game design.
ask, for, more, Cost about 5$ and ask you for more than its quarter value for all in-app purchases? No thanks
pay, for, towers, Payfor game , pay for towers , pay for heroes , pay2play.
pay, for, heroes, Payfor game , pay for towers , pay for heroes , pay2play.
payed, for, game, This game was made impossible to beat so you are forced to get the in-app purchases. It sucks because I payed 5.99 for this game and it should be playable. Reply: The whole game from start to finish. Impossible to play. It's a free pay to win game that you deceivingly charged 5.99 for. Shame!!!!
got, with, pass, I wasn't so willing to give 5 starts just because I got it with the game pass, but this game is, in all honesty, just a great TD game. The developers cared about this game and it shows. There is such depth to the gameplay and nothing is trying to get you to pay for anything once you have the game. This game is about the game, and not making money since I haven't been able to find a way to pay with actual money. Instead, the price reflects the effort put into it, if that all makes sense.

Compared, to, games, Compared to the other games. This is by far the worst Too much money they ask for
playing, from, beginning, Love this game. I've been playing the KR series from the beginning and have loved them all.
pay, for, game, Super lame that you pay for this game to have to pay more for some of the towers and heros. Why can't this be a pay once and done game? So many towers to choose from, seems like this could have been two separate games. Update: it is true you do not need to pay for any of the extra towers or heros to play the game. It's just annoying to know they are there but if you want to use them, you have to pay a high price for it.

play, as, enemies, Love the story line and now you get to play as the enemies
get, to, levels, Its has glitches as you get to the later levels.
playing, since, first, Been playing since the first. Still an awesome tower defense game. Although I'm seeing more and more monetary game mechanics. Hope the next game doesn't go in that direction

loaded, with, purchases, Meh, micro transactions are too steep for the lack lustre gameplay. Don't download until it is free to download, because it is still loaded with in-app purchases that are pretty essential gameplay elements.
pay, for, towers, Just too difficult. Either you have to pay for certain towers (the most expensive hero maxed out isn't enough apparently) or there's just not enough room to play with strategies. No fun for me. Dying over and over just to find some overly specific way to do it at all got old.

looking, for, replacement, Was looking for a Warcraft 3 replacement after my computer died and this was GREAT for that! Looking forward for the Sequel: Legends of Kingdom Rush.

delivered, in, format, Well designed game. If you're a strategy tower defence fan this is a must have! Interesting characters, story delivered in comic book format and relentless anti-heroes combine into fun adventure. Abilities progress tree has no limit when resetting so it can be tailored to your play style. Graphics is pixelized, a common reoccurring retro trend, but this creation draws you in like Jumanji and can swallow you whole. Entertainment for all ages.

play, on, playthrough, Great game as per their usual repertoire. Only annoyances is that you can't zoom out to see whole battlefield at once and cut scenes should only play on first playthrough
uninstall, for, days, This game is a lot of fun but I had to uninstall the game for a few days and when I reinstalled it I lost access to my heros I had bought with the bundle (wich is ×3 the price of the game itself) and had lost quite a bit of progress on missions I had completed the latter part isnt a that hige a deal as it gives me a excuse to replay those levels but losing out on payed content is rather aggravating. Okay update the support system worked and helped me get my lost content back the devs are good.

released, in, 2018, Good series of games , too bad I'm playing the newest one which was released in 2018 :/ , played the free version of another part of kingdom rush then purchased this one but the only other ones are older and I dont think it will be enjoyable to pay for older versions. . . .good time wasting game ahah , cheers

played, until, point, I can't believe you have to purchase the Game, Heroes and Units too. What a RIP off. I have played every game up until this point. Never again. That is ridiculous and you should be ashamed. I was a fan.
stays, on, screen, It's a great game awesome controls cool heroes and easy gameplay it passes time but the only issue is when I start the app it sometimes stays on a black screen and I have too keep restarting the app multiple times but awesome game keep it up
returned, to, Kingdom, I've returned to Kingdom after disinterest in other titles the guys have released. I can go into detail but, perhaps offering reviewers a gratuity would be nice. Access to a newer and different title for free would be a valued exchange. Then I'll respond accordingly Being pestered to review (even purchase shite in house) after buying the game leaves a salty taste in my mouth. Physical game companies don't call on consecutive days asking for your time, or details. Change the dynamic please.

pay, for, towers, Unbalanced maps and towers to make you pay for towers, heroes and gems
watch, with, game, I really love this game, the packages and gems are just too expensive. Especially since you just bought the game. At least with the other game you could watch ads and receive gems. If they added that to this game I would give it five stars

charging, for, towers, I love these games. It is a shame that they are charging extra for towers and heroes but I guess we all need to make a living.
listen, to, reviews, I finished the entire game without paying any more money don't listen to the reviews this is a great and easy game it's not like other free apps or games that are a waste of time
needs, with, game, The game is really fun and looks colorful my only issue is that after having to factory reset my phone I was able to get my other game saved back but not with this game it needs some sort of cloud save I lost all my progress
play, as, guys, I have been playing ever since the first kingdom rush came out and I love this game the fact you get to play as the bad guys has not only flipped the entire franchise on its head but has added a cool and refreshing new twist in the tale.

feel, on, difficulty, This game has been one of my favorite things in this series of games. the tower system is different but I love it it is a little pay walled but it's worth it . The levels feel easier on the easy difficulty and not overwhelming overall the game is a masterpiece . But The only problem I have is that there is no restore content button that you can use to get back the items you paid for. But in the end this game series is one of the best in all of the app store keep up the hard work
pay, for, this, Challenging, but fun. A lot of content is behind a pay wall, which initially was a bit of a turn off (since I already had to pay for this). However, it's definitely possible to clear all achievements without buying extra crystals/towers, etc - it just requires you to be more strategic (that's exactly what I was looking for). Overall, VERY good quality game that will provide days of enjoyment.

pay, for, features, Bought the game to discover that I must pay more for full features. The rest of the game is wonderful!

paid, for, game, As much as I love the game, the paywall to get access to more heroes is too steep. Please add another grind mechanic so people who have already paid for the game can get access to more content.
stepped, in, one, The weakest of the games that is also the most expensive. I get that the art is stepped up in this one, but unless you pay for inapp it feels like you get less towers than any other. This is because of the new way that the special towers work. You choose the 5 specialty towers you want before you go in the level. It's fun but I pretty much agree with all the other reviews critiquing the game.
