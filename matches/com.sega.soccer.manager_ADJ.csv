centre, medical, Well there is the problem with scaling on Samsung, game mechanics is off, still don't know the importance of the medical centre, player database is subpar, I could go on and on... Considering the previous release and the desktop version this is terrible from SI. It is a -2 stars for me, you OWE us.

games, better, Just brought the game nearly 10 quid. Played it for about 30 mins (after it not working for a while) and in my opinion it feels like it takes an age just to play 3/4 games, some games no matter what tactics, formations, players you use you just lose. There are better free games on the market in my opinion

team, first, The game is so buggy. I was looking forward to it so much. Buy it every year. My B teams stats aren't moving. Like at all. So as a compromise I put all of the players up for loan. No takers 2 transfer windows now. Not one player. Tried offering to affiliates (all players reject) and teams. Nothing. Tried allocating coaches to put players out on loan. Nothing. So if I want a players stats to increase, I have to put them straight into the first team and play them. So the game is unplayable for me.
disconnect, whole, Getting refunded, it's probably worth a try. Theres a whole disconnect between google play and developers in terms of where you go for a refund. Game was bugged but have seen other people play and say its good.

edition, first, Congratulations on being the first FM edition to hang your phone! Utterly disappointing. Where do I apply for a refund?
version, nerfed, A broken nerfed down and simplified version of the actual game. Scroll doesn't work and touch screen is completely broken... Terrible, do not buy... Not worth a £1 never mind £ 8.99

ones, good, I have been a fan of Football Manager for a couple of decades. Sadly this isn't one of the good ones. Some nice touches and improvements to the scouting. For me it seems virtually impossible to sell squad players to free up cash and revamp the team. Which means you miss out on the buzz of finding exciting new players. I have tried three different teams and no one is buying the players. I would also like to see an unlockable for reinstating the away goals rule.

time, half, Since I updated to android 12 yesterday my game has been very laggy. Going from screen to screen takes twice as long, matches are stuttering and I've just had the half time jump to full time and then crash, which I've noticed other reviews saying. Game was working fine up until yesterday. Side note, please add skins as the constant dark mode feel of this game really strains my eyes.

game, Good, Good game, but due to my job I often have to do one game at a time, save, and come back to it, but often times the game just decides to not save where you left it and you'll roll back to the previous game. Devs need to look into this.

time, full, It's fun and all but recently the game goes to full time after half time and nothing saves. You either have to start from your last save or the auto saved data. It undo everything you've done till then.

game, Amazing, Amazing game as always, the only two bugs i have found so far is that you can't clear your scout history and you never get a sell on fee for players you sell, even though you set a future sell on fee when selling the player. One other thing is that you can't clearly see what competitions you are in at the home screen.

addition, good, Really good addition to the franchise and much smoother and better than fm21. Limited new features but still makes the game fun to play. One thing I would like from the fm21 game is a summary of the competitions you are in on the home screen. It is hard to see what competitions you are still in etc. **edited** direct free kicks are very op, even players in the national North score them to regularly!

games, previous, As with the previous games, this version is highly addictive, with an excellent level of detail. However, I think FM21 was slightly better. Some suggestions for future updates: 1) Bring back the choice of how many leagues to load from each country. 2) Allow users to return to the game from where they left off if they have to switch apps, rather than having to load the game again even with it running in the background. 3) Contrast the players' positioning colours - it's not clear as it is.

season, new, Why can't I start a new season keeps shutting down
updates, several, Can you please finally fix the bug where you keep conceding counter-attacks from attacking corners as all your players just choose to run towards the opponent's penalty area regardless of the instructions? It's been really annoying in 2021 and is still there in 2022 several updates later. Honestly, this year's version feels nothing more than a skin change.
networks, scouting, Awesome as always...some aspects of the desktop version could have been added this time...was expecting those in this version..but nonetheless worth every penny...the scouting networks are a hit on this version...keep up the good work team FM22

So went into settings, deleted all my achievements, uninstalled the game, reinstalled it and still, no matter how many time I start a new game I have zero funds to buy new players.. Crikey! 😱😆

clubs, other, Like every year, the transfer system is broke. Player valued at 30m, the selling club wants 120m. My player valued at 80m, the buying club won't go above 25m. Pathetic how it overly favours the other clubs with every transfer.
game, working, The game have lots of bugs, pictures not working game is stuck. Refund my money, wait to 2023

years, last, Love the app in general. Just like the last few years the menus are simplistic (which is good) and everything else is good. However, often when I go into games, during the 2nd half it will tell me its full time. Whilst showing me highlights of the game!! Meaning I keep having to restart the game

However, often when I go into games, during the 2nd half it will tell me its full time. Whilst showing me highlights of the game!! Meaning I keep having to restart the game

😊, good, so good 😊
version, new, I love these games and buy new version everytime. This versions seems to have issues however. The home screen shows my reserve team stats for some reason and right after a game it has a summary of the match which is good but states a completely random stadium name. Which all affects the feel of the game and for 8 pound is not very good at all.

game, Worst, The inconsistentcy is ridiculous. Worst game ever.
list, scouted, i just can't find the button to remove player in the scouted list,you should add that
game, good, good game but with some bugs
features, new, One Step Forward, Three Steps Back The new features are good, however the overall experience has been a hot mess. Performance issues where none used to exist with prior FMMs, a bold, if not harsh, UI color scheme, and my frustrations that the app still can't fill to screen highlight my overall dissatisfactions at this point with the app. As someone who sinks both dollars and hours into this game yearly, it just feels frustrating that this is the current "final state".

file, new, I like the game think it's great and well detailed just a few issues that need sorting 1- The installation. It tells me to create a new file in my save drive which is not needed at all especially when fm21 didn't need it 2- the game save doesn't save when loading into fm always says there isn't a file sometimes it does 3- the game crashes during the save and sometimes kicks me out of my game 4-i always seem to lose all my friendly even as big teams against league 1

bugs, Many, Many bugs. I have many players not available in FA cup final. All seems to be on international duties. Also, every VAR calls resulted in no goal. Common, be realistic a bit. There are also bugs running game error but luckily it did not crashed. Out of no where, my manager stats show 2 months with the club when I already almost finish the season.

visuals, Good, Good visuals as always. The only negative difference for me is how slow the game runs and the player icons on Tactics is very slow. Quite frustrating. Needs a bit more sensitivity on player icons.

bugs, many, So many bugs: Players shortlisted aren't shown on my list, transfer fund bonuses for beating bigger teams don't get accumulated directly, occasional failure to launch matches, and worst, so often our strategy doesn't affect the match at all (if you're meant to lose, you'll lose regardless of who or how you play). Lastly, please add some music background or sound effects, it's boring to play in complete silence.

joke, absolute, The transfer values are an absolute joke! Completely ruins the experience of a football manager game
ability, first, Bug in scouting. I assign my scout to find player with first team ability but when i saved the game, exit and load the game again it changed back into any ability
chairman, rich, First it have me options of an in game editor or rich chairman. It wouldn't connect to purchase them. Thought it's probably a good idea not to get involved with that so onto the next page. Couldn't even get the first name and last name. I would click the box, I get the prompt to your my name which I did. Then it still asked me for first name. Also with the second. Cannot get any further now so I've refunded it.

features, less, Last played FM mobile in 2012 so I was excited to see how the game had developed since then. Turns out it hasn't, if anything it now has even less features than it did back then.
team, first, Player stats didn't show until i click on it, scout result doesn't show as their role (youth, first team, and etc.), and a little bit hard to sell player than before, isn't it?

Very disappointed. Also, the extra time doesn't look clearly, because of the spot (..........) Always, some player are vanish.

years, previous, different from previous years but I like the changes
levels, amazing, I don't really understand this game. It has amazing levels of detail, yet the actual gameplay is remarkably easy. Man United are struggling in the league, yet in the game I'm comfortably first. I barely change the team and haven't altered my tactics once, either before or in game. Yet I win almost every match. Other lack of attention to detail is strange - why do opposing teams put up a one-man wall for corners? Which regularly blocks corner kicks? I have never seen this in real life!

issue, known, I'm giving this game 1 star atm because I have literally just purchased the game & started my career to find that I have £0 money to spend on transfers for a Premier league team. I don't know if this is a known issue or its supposed to be that way but half of the fun of the game is to buy players & I can't.

players, English, Bugs and too easy. Came 6th in PL season 3 and have no Europa or no Europa Conference football!! Save ruined as I can already see AGAIN it's far too easy, already limiting myself to only buying English players. This is not fun. Started in League 1.

time, first, *problem solved* When I played it for the first time everything was ok, no bugs. But since I closed the game and then started it again, the resolution completely changed and I can not do anything to change it, now it s the same every time, bad resolution (Samsung S20 FE)

gripes, major, Two major gripes. Firstly, the injuries are just ridiculous. Losing a player for four months due to a training ground injury, and then losing four first team players for at least a month is ridiculous. Secondly, the transfers. If a player is listed at 20 mil, then why does it take 4 times that amount to buy him? Either list a players true price or stop with the insane inflation.

Losing a player for four months due to a training ground injury, and then losing four first team players for at least a month is ridiculous. Secondly, the transfers.

game, best, The best football management game out there for mobiles.
game, saved, Game crashed and has deleted my saved game
end, other, FED UP OF THIS BROKEN GAME!!! GET IT FIXED!!! Why is it that my defenders just seem to completely disappear, CONSTANTLY leaving attackers alone to score. At the other end, no matter the striker, completely miss the target 90% of the time. No matter what team, tactics, I've tested this, the opposition ALWAYS score in injury time at least once. Tested 8 of the best teams in the world. 8 best goalkeepers in the world and they constantly get 4/5 rating, every game. They score from their 18yd box!

youngster, best, So far so good but its too hard to sell my players.. My players still younger, it got 5 stars in the editor also its wages still cheaper and it got award the best youngster but there is no one who wants to buy ==' Its so so different from football manager 2019.. My hope that u can try to add any fitur to edit in the editor in the game.. I would like to see if there is a fitur to edit about second national n languange.. I bought this editor in game for this fitur

version, latest, Very similar to FM21 except the game doesn't save properly. Every time I go back on, I have to start again. Waste of my time and money. Either sort it out or refund me. I've had most FM's before this latest version and enjoyed them all.
games, saved, absolutely riddled with bugs. Screens stretched. Crashes after 2 games. Takes an age to save a game. Wouldn't pay 99p let alone the price you have charged if I knew it was this bad. I now cannot load any of my saved games! How do i go about getting a refund. Worst game in years!!

copy, Feeble, Feeble bad copy of a real game - going back to last year's Touch. Glad the decision works for the company. Not so glad how easily they screwed their long term fans.

quality, Good, Good quality game

game, Good, Good game but sometimes still got error
games, first, Everytime I try and start a game on Samsung galaxy s21 the game closes. The first 3 games worked okay and now I cannot play
flaw, Only, Only flaw is I was in fa cup final and international took my team had to use 16 yearolds

game, fantastic, fantastic game!!!!!🥰🥰🥰
game, good, Very good game, could have included interview of managers and players Pre n post matches. Can give it by options.
game, best, best game of this era
bug, many, Too many bug
passes, long, I put my tactics for goalkeeper contribution as short but he always makes long passes and I sometimes concede goals from that. This is an issue that has been occurring from different versions of the game and I thought it would have been fixed by now

fan, huge, Im a huge fan of FM but once again this is the same as last version with a few extra small features... the game is very easy to play, too easy. Im half way thru a season and its the same journey as before. Sign 3 or 4 good players and its easy to win almost everything... Would be nice if they could make the tactics more detailed or have an option at the start to make the game harder to play. The GUI is the same, probably choosen bright pink to mask the fact its just a slight update on FM21

year, last, still same like last year
names, proper, How do you get the faces, badges and the proper names for clubs like Juventus
features, new, This year's game seems very nice, most especially with the new features.
game, shocking, Not real to life, every team you play against has to score no matter what. Absolutely shocking game
update, ambitious, very ambitious update, and i like what you are trying to do. but the game is much buggier and not ready. when the bugs and glitches are fixed i'll come back with a 5 star review:)
refund, full, Game was going brilliant. Now whenever I open the game after like 10 seconds the game closes down completely. I can now no longer play the game. I want a full refund on this game. Shocking.
game, good, Looks like a good game but spoiled by a bug which means one of my best players can't improve stats (also the only player I've signed to the team, so that may be something to do with what went wrong). His development bar reached full but it has not been converted into skill points and reset to zero as it does for other players. Still there half a season later. Happy to share more details with the devs if they want to get in touch.

t, impressed, Not impressed with the game play, wen 2-0 up at h/t most times u end up drawing 2-2 or losing 3-2 and nearly every game conceding in 90th min, I'm impressed with the work done on transfers, something needs to be done about the greens on player positions as they are too similiar colour, the colours need to be more defined like last year's version

althought, good, I only played about less than an hour because I read the reviews an they weren't so good. Here's my two cents: The gameplay was good althought I found some parts laggy and the visuals, my eyes hurt man. I love the idea of the pink/purple contrast maybe you guys could make it a lighter shade. I love the addition of the medical centre and the scouting options overall I think there are a few places that can be improved upon especially visually. I hope it gets better with future updates

day, single, Running as awesome as always in my Samsung J7-2016. Have no Doubt about the Gameplay and others. It's very fun to play this game every single day since 2005 version ❤❤❤ Worth to Buy, Worth to Download, Worth to Play it. Thank you SEGA ❤❤❤
players, half, Liked the game initially but now it is get annoying how the board won't improve our training facilities past good even after back to back promotions to English championship. Even though the team reports say that our training facility is sub par and even though we have 10 million pounds in bank. All my half decent players are desperate to leave the club because of this. This doesn't make sense compared to real life as you would think that any club that climbed 4 divisions would have some ambition

season, first, It's been a couple of years since I last played fm handheld and I must say I'm impressed with you much it has advanced. However, I'm about a 1/4 the way through my first season and have came to my first major issue. I have a semi-final of a league cup and about 14 of 26 players are away on international duty, meaning I'm having to play the mate with fringe players and fake players as substitutes. I just don't understand how this even happens?

var, Ingiltere, 1. Bize oyun başında 5 tane lig seçtiriyor, Ingiltere amatör kümeye kadar lig var ama Türkiye 3. lig yok! geçen sene bu sorunu yazdığımda cihaz yetersizliği cart curt demiştiniz. 2. Fm21 den bir farkı yok neredeyse bir tek sağlık merkezi eklenmiş ve tasarım, ne veri merkezidir ne sosyal medyadır yook. 3.Yenilenmiş maç motoru dediniz Fm20 deki maç motorunun aynısı. Olumlu yanları var mı derseniz var tabii en önemlisi zamanınız iyi geçiyor her türlü ama 90tl ye fm21 in aynısı alınmaz arkadaşlar.

version, first, I love football manager games and I buy the latest one every year. I always have a Samsung phone and it works really well. My son has a Motorola phone and this is the first version he has ever tried to play and it does not work. The layout is weird, you cannot see a lot of the screen and therefore can't access certain parts of the game! Can this be fixed? He is a footy mad 11 year old who wants to play the game I love so much! Thanks 👍

update, Superficial, Superficial update with jarring colour scheme. No important changes like team talks, training improvements or proper press engagement.

coincidence, bad, Love the game, but whilst playing, the game crashed and now my SD card is corrupt. Not sure if bad coincidence or a MAJOR problem caused by fm 22
dont, Basic, Basic......dont like it. I can't believe the is no FM22 Touch version. It was by far the best version for Tablets. Will it make a comeback?

ups, international, Game is great but I have 2 problems: If I minimise or the screen goes to sleep the game crashes when i go back to it (moto g50). Also, i got to the fa cup final (yay me!) but both my and my opponents teams have been decimated by international call ups, cup final is June 1st, 2022 nation cup starts June 3rd
game, good, The game is a good game but I have one issue, I am managing derby county in the efl championship, I drew my 1st match and won my 2nd match but on the league table my team is 24th with a -8points,how possible? It's very annoying to be having issues like this after paying for the game.

scheme, new, This is basically FM21 with a new (and worse) color scheme. Also, it's impossible to sell players in this game which is really annoying

bugs, many, I like the game, and the gameplay. I haven't encountered too many bugs, but one that is really frustrating me is I'm unable to sign into google play games with the game? I was the first time I played now ever since I can't. I've tried reinstalling, clearing the cache of the google play services/games apps and no success. I've also tried to report the issue via the ingame report and the game crashes. But yeah other that I'm enjoying the game.

occasions, numerous, This almost feels unfinished. On numerous occasions I'll click to start a match and it says error occurred, try again. On match day, the 'dots' that show you which screen you're on, overlap the added time red box (not a major issue but aesthetically it's annoying) The manager's home page is hard to navigate, if I want to find out about s match, I have to click into fixtures then the match, rather than on the home screen. The league table is also too zoomed in. There's more but no room...

game, good, Started off as a relatively good game however despite updating it its still crashing on my Samsung. Not good enough
thing, good, Enjoying the game not been easy so far which is a good thing. Only minor complaint is not having any sound in game background music or sound effects during matches would be cool.

gameplay, laggy, laggy gameplay on computer
badges, real, Not the best or anywhere close in my opinion. Lack of some player photos and real badges is annoying and lack of involvement in the rest of the aspects of the club.
goal, set, How do I get refund?????? Kept losing against "easy to win" Side and kept conceded by set piece goal. WHY??????

week, first, They said they'd fixed the transfer system which lured me in, but it's a load of nonsense. After the first week PSG had already spammed a nonsense under value bid for my top player. It's still impossible to sell anyone for any decent value. And in return the AI still expects 19 trillion dollars for anyone remotely of quality. I could cope with the stupid transfer values if they were fair....but it's not.

manager, free, Whilst i have been playing Soccer manager 22 (completely free) the matches were in 3d, i expected the same from football manager but on an improved level, i've loved fm since the mid 2000's on pc. The detail on this mobile version is good but without 3d matches i can see myself reverting to soccer manager shortly. Unfortunately regretting this purchase

Another save and I win 2 manager of the year awards in a day and I get sacked 3 days later. I have bought this game every year but this is the last until this is fixed. Also exactly what do you need to win to unlock Place on the Board?

scrolling, horrible, Enjoying so far but still need to fix the horrible scrolling of team lists etc please create a smooth scrolling experience, so it doesn't just keep jumping back and forth. Played a couple of seasons ago and not too much has changed including the scrolling, overall it continues to be a good franchise just some refinements required.

year, last, Game pretty much the same as last year, only difference is the colour scheme that makes your eyes bleed. Still issues with transfers (most of the time teams expect unrealistic prices for players, it seems that any half decent player is min £50million to buy. But at the same time you will be lucky to be offered market value for your own players)

issue, small, Loving the game so far, as usual. However I have 1 small issue. Stoppage time. If it is showing the pitch, the stoppage clock is hidden behind one of the dots, when not showing the pitch it is fine and has the dots after the clock. Be nice if it was fixed as you really want to see how much stoppage time you have when displaying the pitch

version, downgraded, Update as of 12th Nov. Game is still laggy. Maybe because we cant choose what leagues to concentrate on. Like FM21, we can start choose Championship in England. Ui is not stretchy now though. Dont see a diff frm FM21. Old: Why is the game laggy. Using s20 ultra so my games do not lag except this one! And the UI! Omg. It is stretched until it looks like a downgraded version of fm21 when it's supposed to be an upgraded version. Was so looking forward to fm22 and now i'm very dissappointed!

screen, full, Have bought FM Mobile for years and never had an issue until 2022. Game doesn't cover the full screen so it's all small and awkward to press on next button etc. How do you get a refund because it's an absolute waste of money! Just downloaded it today but would not recommend at all! Wouldn't waste your money such a shame

ffs, new, Do something new ffs. Like you keep talking about device limitations. My phone is more powerful than my potato laptop which I use to run the regular fm game. You CAN do better. More tactical options, more positions, more depth. Honestly, what kind processing power do "media features" need? (Interviews, team talks etc). We have a medical centre...and better transfers AI...wheres the added realism, the immersion? NOT EVEN CROWD AND REFEREE SOUNDS FFS. HOW HARD IS IT. I'd defo pay more for these.

purple, pink, really enjoying it so far. don't really like the pink/purple background though. hurts the eyes a little
step, big, The game doesn't feel like a big step up I requested a refund and still haven't received my money ,it's been 5 days
hours, many, Can sink so many hours into Football manager, and the mobile version is perfect for playing when out and about, my train journeys to work are better for it! Really helpful support team at Sega too. Had an early issue which they got fixed for me really quickly. Thank you!

game, last, I'm going to play it, and probably a lot. But please make it harder. Even in the last game I got to the point of having 600m to spend, and 8m under wage budget and going unbeaten for 130 games with Portsmouth. Also, change the pink. Just change it, it's awful. No new major features to note. Phone screens are more like tablets now anyway, so why not have the touch version at least available for mobiles. Alternatively, just make this version a little more like that, with more detail, and tactics.

game, saved, Very poor. Will not open up a saved game.
times, many, I enjoyed playing the game but no matter how many times i save the game it just resarts me.
impressions, excellent, excellent first impressions of the game, just played first season and easy to navigate around the game.

nation, select, Really not what I expected. Why do some players disappear depending on what nation's you select at the start. Unable to build the squad you want because of that. Transfer values are so unrealistic when trying to make offers. Clubs wanting £100 million plus for average or unproven players at the very start of first seasons. Will keep sticking at it to see if can get into it more.

year, last, It's okay I just feel like they tried too hard to make it better than last year but now it's a bit more confusing and the play prices are rediculous if you have 40 million that can't even get you ayoze perez but can somehow get you Zaha for half the prices. Also the game hasn't even changed apart from the players and the home screen so it make it a bit boring bc it just feels like fm21 but in a different style of colour. But overall its a alright game but the player prices really let it down!

taker, first, Lost pinalty shoot-out becauce 3 of first 5 pinalty taker are defender.. why i cant chose the player who took the pinalty... there is no diferent from the past FMM
upgrades, many, Not many upgrades to 2021 and this game is a buggy mess on top of that (s20 fe)

stuff, new, Alot of new stuff !!!👍there is a irritating over sketch bug. I have to restart my phone alot of times. Please help to solve it.
time, half, Absolutely terrible, I've spent 10 minutes trying to play one game and the furthest I've gotten without crashing was half time. UI looks terrible on stretch and is too small regularly. Why up the price for this.
graphic, worst, Have been playing since 2018.. I think this version have the worst graphic for match.. So many un unusual (weird) movement from player.. One of my defender chasing striker at their own half, then the striker can score from that far. While the other defender still on their position.. Goal keeper run to left corner while therw is attack from right side.. Its super disturbing.. Please fix it..

side, vanarama, This rating may well change...but at the moment I've taken over a vanarama North side and my squad has between 3 and 5 stars....eh? A 35k player has not just potential but current 5 stars...and 90٪ of my team have 3+....this isn't right is it surely?!?

ultra, s21, I have a Samsung galaxy s21 ultra. When I load the app up it stretches far to big like its zoomed in how can I resolve this issue?
goal, disallowed, seem to be getting 1 disallowed goal every game which is annoying but apart from that good game
game, good, seem to be getting 1 disallowed goal every game which is annoying but apart from that good game
opening, initial, Screen either becomes really small or really stretched when reopening the game after the initial opening. Unplayable when this happens.
slots, multiple, I've had it for less than two days and am already close to giving up. My game has stopped saving, despite trying different/multiple slots, so I keep losing progress. Much as I'd like to, I can't keep the game running 24/7 to negate this issue. Expected better quite frankly
version, mobile, Very disappointed, not played the mobile version for a while as I was able to get the touch version on my phone, now there's no touch version I have to pay this version and it hasn't changed since I last played, in fact it's worse. You can't instruct the players via touchline shouts, it looks like a game for people with poor vision with how big everything is. Nowhere near enough detail in the game to warrant the price. Bring back the touch version!!!

game, Great, Great game and a bargain for 8.99 and considering it's mobile, it's one of the best mobile games I've played up to date, UI is a bit too bright, there are a few small bugs and players do consistently get injured but other than that, amazing game, please buy it and don't base it off the reviews because the reviewers are mainly haters for some reason

shambles, Absolute, Absolute shambles! Slow, keeps randomly crashing, saved game wouldn't load, auto save caused it to crash, switched phone off & on and save has now disappeared completely! Player search menu change was unnecessary. Keep closing the search instead of resetting it! Quality has randomly gone from HD to potato! Paid for the game, unlockables bundle and to purchase a tutor for a coach and now that save is gone and the other things I've bought are useless. Get this sorted ASAP or you owe me money...

game, Shocking, Shocking game. Either it is stretched across my phone or its a little box in the middle of my screen. When it does actually work or load and work properly the transfer market is shocking even average players have a asking price of 3x there value.

center, added, Ok. So, this is just a FM21 Mobile clone with an added "injury center". No other (obvious) changes to the core game. The color scheme is way to bright. I get a headache after 5mins. Hot pink on black is bad. This is known. The match engine seems... wrong. I'm seeing opponents score 3-4 times more then they normally would. And scoring frequently from the middle of the pitch. Which is weird, because everything else feels the same as 21. I think it needs more polishing. I'll refund for now.

phones, large, The screen is not clear for large samsung note phones. Stretch function toggle either way does not work
button, restore, The game downloaded well, & I set up my first save ok, but now the 'restore' save button doesn't work on the start screen. I cannot access my saved game, so no good at All. I'm sure over the coming days & weeks the issues & bugs will all be ironed out, but until then, I'll stick with SM Worlds. Only 1 star obviously, Impossible to review a game that I can't play, but will re-review when I can play.

decisions, bad, There are still pretty bad UI decisions. Not only of a toxic pink color (you can get used to it), but the scaling is broken on Day 2, also the added minutes sign is covered by the first dot from menu. Also, it is not allowed to demote players to the reserves, though the squad grows big with players nobody wants even to loan. I guess, is a historical issue, and was introduced before

screen, visual, Interface seems to have got worse over the years, screen visual not great with it being stretched rather than filling correctly in HD, no imaging rights for a number of top clubs and players.

issue, same, I am also having the same issue as some others. When I close the game an open it up again the screen it stretched an blurry. I then have to close an open the game until it is OK again
version, previous, Better than the previous version... Worth buying if your into manager games.. currently best on the market I'd say
gameplay, good, Really good gameplay, but is anyone having a problem with the view? Slightly blurry and everything is enhaced/bigger?
window, tiny, It's completely unplayable on an S21 Ultra, as it is stretched to fit the screen with no scaling at all. If you turn the stretch feature off it is a tiny window in the middle of the screen.
season, next, It's taking time to load and process. Game crashes when I click New Season to begin the next season.
lack, Disappointing, Disappointing lack of improvements to FM21. The bright pink colour hurts the eyes even with dimmed screen. Common snags from FM21 haven't been resolved - e.g. all goals from corner kicks described on commentary as being from counter attacks. Player abilities quite lazily generally seem to be the same as FM21 despite certain players clearly being much better/worse.

season, first, Crashed after the first season. Won the league and now its not loading at all
screen, stretched, When will the stretched screen get fixed.
game, Awesome, Awesome game. Loving it and really great to pass time
issue, common, Unplayable due to UI! Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing as it was this is a common issue but the screen in stretched and it doesn't work properly now. Worked fine for a few hours but now unplayable. Really not happy about this, releasing a bug ridden game, charging more every year I can handle, but charging 8.99 for a game that literally can't be played after a few hours is daylight robbery! Please fix this asap or give a refund for purchase as this is unacceptable.

game, unfinished, Worse than FMM2021, I wish I could refund this unfinished, abandoned, buggy game, and probably won't be fixed anytime soon. 1. Screen resolution automatically change once I re-enter the game and there is no option menu to change it back to normal 2. There is no major change to in-game editor (can't place coach in any team, no manager search, can't add players in the game) yet they charge for a lot of money 3. Why don't they add the easier feature to increase/decrease the salary by 1000 or 10000

teams, other, I still played FM2020 touch and have to say that on mobile it was good. Not sure why they aren't releasing it on mobile this year . As I instantly regretted buying this after 15 mins . The in match options are so poor can't seem to give instructions on how you play against other teams during play . The in game display seems like you let your kids lose with the crayons.... big step backwards TBH . I hope a touch version becomes available for mobile devices until then I'll stick with the 2020 one

launch, First, Terribly unstable. First launch was ok. Subsequent launch the app crashed and the resolution became grainy and the screen aspect became distorted. 3rd launch i lost all my saved games. I have religiously bought every FM on android for last few years. This is by far the worst i have encountered.

team, same, Its good. Would be 5 stars if i didnt lose to burnley after beating Barcelona 3-0 with the same team
problem, same, I have the same problem with most of the people who gave Reviews. Display is great once installed but once you close and open it again. It becomes zoomed in and affects display quality and interface. Please check on this. I am using a Samsung Galaxy s20 FE. And just an addition, I played the previous gamr FMM21 on this same device without any problems.

years, many, I always get this game and have done for many years. As previous reviews do state on here, there is a couple of little improvements that could be made. The 2nd time the game is open the stretch mode is the only way to get a full screen but it is what the mode suggests, its stretched and not very pleasant at all and an update to fix this would be ideal. The colours to see the players positional strengths need an improvement, its not as clear as previous games which is disappointing too.

problem, biggest, Awful, alot of bugs, ui js all over the place, and the biggest problem the game is way too small for my screen so it's impossible to enjoy, getting a refund not worth it at all
data, saved, Unable to load saved data???? Why????
days, past, Playing for past two days. I recently had FM 2020. So here's the review. - Game simulation is just pathetic. Random players move to random areas and suddenly it's a goal! Real disappointment. - Game simulator suddenly gets frozen for no reason. My phone's other features are working normally, so an issue with the game and not the phone. - UI color scheme is too saturated. Really not pleasant to eyes for long hours. Thus the two stars reduced otherwise a good game overall.

box, tiny, Galaxy S20, game displayed in tiny box in the middle of the screen. Not even worth playing until this is sorted. Back to FM21 for now.
box, small, Fitting the screen on an S20+ looks terrible. Either really stretched or only a small box in the middle of the screen
game, great, still a great game but not many changes apart from roster update

year, last, Not much of an upgrade from last year but still fun. Doesn't fit my screen properly though which is very disappointing. S21+. Very stretched and is annoying for long periods of time.

bugs, many, So many bugs and every game I've created (3) has crashed by atleast the 2nd game of each season and corrupted, so each save deleted and wasted everything I did each time. Seems a total waste of money and very much like 21... havent noticed any difference.

medium, happy, Feel conned into making this purchase since we were told the happy medium for tablets would be via xbox gamepass. However that version is unplayable on tablet given half the controls require controller and their answer is to enable onscreen controller? It's not the same. I hope they relook at that. I'm speaking from ignorance but I am unsure why we couldn't have just paid for an updated roster patch for fm touch 21? Instead were relegated to old skool fm even though prior versions were better?

screen, overall, Yesterday this game was perfect. However, today there has been some update that stretched the overall screen and made the game unplayable. Based on the comments it does not appear that I am alone with this complaint. Please update the game and I'll adjust my rating up to 5 stars. Thank you!
screen, full, Please team FM is there a solution of increasing the display to full screen? I am using a Samsung A22 and I am not getting full screen display rather a center cut display? Can it be fixed? The app is not just functioning. I don't know if it's because of the resolution size or whether it is not compatible with Samsung A22. I can't even access the home menu. It's a java game on an android.

manager, new, I love the new football manager 2022 and I play football manager 2021 and I would like to see it on the PlayStation 5
square, little, Game experience is fine but when I try to start it again, it won't load, I just get a little square on the screen. On a Samsung G21 Ultra. Any fixes.
resolution, weird, Screen resolution problem. It worked fine until now. As it seems screen has a weird resolution (zoomed in) and can't fix it. Please advice or release the fix as soon as possible. Thanks!
play, first, Worked fine on first play, went back to load my save again and now the screen is stretched and no way of seemingly getting it back to normal. Also doesn't seem to be a way of changing the skin and the pink is too bright for my liking
experience, bad, Excellent!!! Game, had bad experience but I gave it a chance and it's pretty decent.
bugs, few, A few bugs so far (including one where the game crashed when I tried to report a bug) but enjoying the game play as usual. The new medical tab is a great new feature especially as there are so many injuries in the early game.

games, saved, Cant load any saved games, it has "resume game" but it won't let me choose it. Problems from the get-go
game, Brilliant, Brilliant game if u find it blurry the graphics force to stop ur game and that should help
hours, few, Will review my review once they sort the stretch bug, played it for a few hours no issues then all of a sudden the picture is stretched and won't go back
game, established, Fix the screen stretching, for such a established game which i was excited for it to come out, its really disappointing
view, full, Screen isn't full view. Stretch display is blurry. Terrible quality

time, 1st, 1st time I opened game no issues on my mobile, 2nd time opening the screen is stretched horribley and no way of fixing it via the options. 2ndly they still haven't fixed the player offer system on mobile, players still over priced in almost every case. The skin is awful also

time, next, Screen is stretched. It worked fine when installed but then the next time I went on it is pixilated - have tried to untick stretch screen but this just makes it go very small. Please sort the bug! Great game though

years, Last, Doesn't fit to screen! Why can't it fit properly? Last years was fine
screen, uninstslled, Wish I hadn't bothered, one minute it's half a screen, uninstslled and tried again, got a stretched screen. Waste of money

man, grown, I hate the pink all over the skin, absolutely hate it! Fine for my daughter, but not for a grown man! If I wanted vivid pink all over my favourite game I'd be playing LOL Surprise and not a football game. Not even an option to tone it down or change it..... so far..... but hopefully Sega come to their senses before I request a refund and move over to a football manager game that looks like a football manager game and not an attempt to draw in female customers

developer, Dear, Dear developer. I bought every version of this game for a long time, I'm a big fan of FM since 2005! And always disappointed in FM Mobile. Why don't support the new screen ratio!? It's 2 years ago that I asked for this! The developer told me the new mobile screen ratio was hard to fix for support and I understand it. But after 2 years your game still does not support the new mobile screen ratio!? Really? Why does iPhone's new screen ratio has support but for Andriod phone doesn't? From a big fan of your game...till now.

way, long, I still would rather play FM 2020, 2021 didn't live up to the mark and I was really hoping 2022 would but this one bites the dust as well. I mean it's gone a long way trying to make the mobile version just like the pc version, which at least I personally did not sign up for. Selling players has just detoriated since FM 2020, in both FM 2021 & 2022 its near impossible to sell your players for even a low price, but you must overpay for even the weakest of players. Not a big fan of the layout too.

game, saved, Have played Football Manager for years. I wish I hadn't bought this years version. On FM22 Mobile I played for a while then saved the game. When I tried to go back in the saved game was not there and I had to start all over again. Tried a few times and same problem!

screen, stretched, At first it was fine but then got the stretched screen like everyone else(Samsung S21) Fun game but I'm not going to play it in this state.
clubs, other, Manchester United FC are spelt Manchester UFC and Man UFC, but all other united clubs are correct like sheff utd .
screen, horrible, Every time the game closes and I then open the game later to play, it opens with a horrible stretched screen (including players faces). To fix this issue, I need to reboot the phone. If it is not fixed, I think I'll request a refund.

league, specific, When I add player faces, logos and kits the game takes up to an hour to load. And can't choose a specific league I want to load in a country, it literally selects all division in that country and it makes the game slow.
rubbish, Absolute, Awful. Absolute rubbish. This is the only game I ever buy every year. Wish I hadn't bothered this year Game absolutely doesn't work on the Galaxy Note Ultra. Screen is awful stretched and unreadable in some places. Crashes every two to three games. Sometimes games end but you cant progress meaning a restart is needed and the game needs playing again. Awful, dreadful. DO NOT BUY IT!!

options, new, The game freezes quite a lot and when trying to reload the game it zooms in with the quality being poor and a number of functions not being available. Love the new options on tactics but the app has quite a few problems
bug, much, So much bug, please quick update
update, quick, So much bug, please quick update
time, first, More than willing to change my review as I get Football Manager every year and every year I love it and literally get hundreds of hours out of it. This is the first time I've ever had problems, once I select which nations I want to play in, it's just stuck in "Initializing Game" and just doesn't progress, was stuck on that screen for about 20 minutes. Really gutted as I was really looking forward to this edition and the new features, hopefully this can get resolved.

hours, few, Just got the game and it was doing fine until a few hours later, all of a sudden, the game app closed. When I started it again, the screen display got stretched and my progress was gone. Please please fix this display issue and bug. This game is amazing, please dont make me do a refunx for it, thank.you.
error, unable, I cant play the game. It shows error unable to connect to play store. How to fix...?
save, first, Regretted buying it. Display is off. Game crashed at first save. User interface is not user friendly. Colour scheme is way too bright. Once restarted, game display is stretched.

time, first, This is the first time in over 6/7 games I can say that the game is not worth the money. I would normally buy the in game pack too but not this time. The natural screen is tiny and when you then click to stretch it via user interface it looks horrible. Previous games didn't have this issue so why change it? To be honest it actually spoils what could have been a really good game. The developers should be ashamed of FM22MOBILE its an absolute disgrace a company so experienced in making this game.

players, updated, Played over an hour to then find out the game has wiped all my saves. Very angry. Plus this is pretty much FM21 but with updated players. That's it. Save your money and don't buy this. Also phones now could easily support Touch version but they are too lazy to make this support mobiles.
teams, best, Could have a youth Leagues . So clubs can have the best youth teams . Also can you put so new owners to buy the club.

graphics, such, Nothing has changed much, if games such as Call of duty can handle such detailed graphics why can't you guys add this. These reviews won't make any difference because you guys do what you want anyway😓 also The Screen stretch issue. Makes the screen bigger not sure why???

additions, nice, The game is good, there are some nice additions. Although, the second time I opened the game it was completely stretched out and was no longer HD settings. In addition, the colour setting are too faint especially when looking at how comfortable players are in different positions.

experience, Bad, Bad experience at the moment. On my Samsung S21 Ultra the app runs in such a low res and there doesn't seem to be an option to change it. The screen is stretched and unplayable.

features, unnecessary, Seems like the focus was on unnecessary features. Would really appreciate more roles in tactics and option to train player traits. This scout update is useless. Nothing that I couldn't do manually by searching and then scouting them. The medical center also seems underwhelming. Really not happy with the 2022 version. 2021 was far better.

night, last, Screen stretch needs Fixinh ASAP was fine last night and now turned into a layout from 2003 you take screen stretch off and it's tiny 😳
squad, decent, The game itself is playable but the injury centre feature is a bit tedious. Players seem to get injured all the time. I can't seem to win a game at all even with a decent squad against weaker opposition. It'd be great if you could become under 21s international manager.

applause, massive, First off, kudos to the devs to fix the bugs so quickly so massive applause to you guys. Second, once again, your team has delivered quality. Absolutely awesome guys. Love playing it. A few niggles here and there. One, the UI colour scheme has to change, its way too bright. The previous versions had a better UI color scheme. Also, i noticed in my game, the player faces wont show, even for the Barcelona team(which im managing atm) so please look into that. Otherwise, another golden egg from you.

versions, previous, First off, kudos to the devs to fix the bugs so quickly so massive applause to you guys. Second, once again, your team has delivered quality. Absolutely awesome guys.

times, few, Display getting stretching after few times. Need to fix this issue
features, New, I'm really impressed with the game this year. New features are really good. Overall gameplay experience is faster than before. All good. Keep up the good work. The only thing I would suggest is that please change the pink colour to show only when the response is really needed and not for the normal continue button because its not good for the eyes. Other than that, its a brilliant game again.

time, First, First time I played it all was fine. Everytime since the screen is stretched too much and makes the screen layout a bit wrong and therefore unplayable as it sends my eyes crazy...but not stretching the screen means it is just in a small box in the middle of the screen. Needs fixing before I can play this again.

bugs, many, So many bugs again: I am Newcastle and the board have sacked me for being in 6th place in season 1!?! My selected team also somehow changes between games so I have to change the line up almost every game to my preferred line up

features, new, Loving the game so far, appreciate the new features added! It'd be great if the display be optimised for the Z Fold 3, playing the game in stretched mode isn't really pleasing to the eyes.

screen, full, It's not full screen. Pls fix it!!!
players, fake, I dong Like fake players name
game, optimised, More than impressed with this year's version. The team have knocked it out the park as they do each year... Don't be put of buying and downloading by the reviews that it's not the same as the pc version. Simply put its not a pc optimised game it's not going to be like the pc version. Gameplay is easy to follow and enjoy there's nothing better than knocking your rivals out the cup
features, new, The name should be Football Manager 2021 (2) for lack of new features..
nations, select, Crashes at the select nations page
roles, more, This game is effectively the same as 21 with roster and aesthetics update. I wished the game had added more roles that the PC version has (eg. Wide Centre-backs, Complete Winger, Complete Center Back, etc), and the editor also doesn't allow one to change one's languages even when the search option is available. Also: There should had been options to hire extra staff for international teams.

screen, full, The game isn't bad it doesn't full screen on my phone and it's kinda annoying I'm on the Samsung s20 Fe. The game is basically the same as last year I would like to see more added but oh well. I buy this for on the go and play the PC version when I'm at home. 3 star till game gets fixed cause it's kinda buggy.
