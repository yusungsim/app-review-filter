're, games, great, they, I got the same feeling from this one that I did when the original Game Dev Story came out. None of the other games have done that, they're all great games of course but I really like this one.
's, game, decent, It, It's a decent game
's, game, pleasant, it, Another solid Kairosoft management sim. This is a little bit like Theme Park, but with an interface players will recognise if they have played other titles from this developer. It's a little slow to make progress it it's a very pleasant game to kill time.
'm, fan, massive, I, I'm a massive Kairosoft fan! This has to be my new favourite game. Hours of fun. ありがとうございます。
been, fan, huge, I, I have always been a huge fan of all Kairosoft games. My only complaint is that they don't come out as regular as I would like.
's, game, best, It, It's the best game ever! 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
is, experience, deep, this, Excellent game by Kairosoft once again, I buy every title they release. The price is more than fair, this is a deep, replayable, fully realized experience. I have been waiting for an amusement park ever since they released the water slide water slide, I realized that they had the parts in motion to be able to do so.
