's, game, great, It, It's a great game. Slightly different to the desktop version. Fun and pausabke. Ideal game for waiting.
are, games, underrated, They, Great little mobile game. The big game Mini motorways is amazing. They are the most underrated games on here.
is, game, great, it, This game is super fun when you are into puzzle or strategy games. I gave 4 stars because overall it is a great game but I wish they implement mods like new custom maps like in pc version. I am hoping to get that feature in android and also new maps like taipei, manila, kuala lumpur, tokyo, moscow, vienna, busan, amsterdam, zurich and etc.
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing puzzle game
is, game, fantastic, It, Orgianally I played it on computer for free on coolmathgames then I thought I might be able to have it for my phone(obvisously I was right) but enough with that It is a fantastic game. I just wish you go infintely.
's, game, cool, It, It's a cool game for about a week, and then it's boring and old. It has potential.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game
's, game, challenging, it, Been playing the Steam PC version for years. I can tell you the Steam PC version is far better than the phone version: 1) Phone version is too small even on a 6.8" screen, 2) requires a lot of zooming in and zooming out, 3) Touch control is horrible if you don't zoom in first, 4) Your finger blocks your view, 5) Drains battery like crazy (and I should remind you your phone could explode if you charge while playing as it gets really warm), 6) You still get sound even after disabling sound LOL! (which is alright as its not as invasive). Other than that, it's a challenging game! The phone version scoreboard is separate from the PC version scoreboard. The phone scoreboard look more authentic; PC scoreboard has lots of cheat/fake scores.
's, game, great, it, This game is great, always fun for an engaging distraction. I'm hoping in the future they add more modes from PC, but check it out regardless! Edit, well they did it! I thought I updated this sooner, but they deserve the 5 stars, it's a great game! Endless is nice for someone like me who's not too great at the game and it's also good for practice to learn what really works.
is, game, paced, It, It is a slow paced game that it easy to play and good if you need to dmstay quiet.
is, game, good, It, It is a really good game. Very recommended!
's, fun, much, It, This game is a clever and challenging puzzle game you aren't meant to beat. The GUI is the best i've seen in any video game and yet it's so minimal that it would go unnoticed by most people. I can't believe i only spent a dollar on this game! It's so much fun!
's, builder, fun, It, It's a very very fun train line builder. 100% recommend. It has endless hours of fun built into a simple stimulating game. The complex possibilities are endless. Calming. Chill. Relaxed. IT EVEN HAS DARK MODE!!
is, game, short, It, Definitely a fun game and I enjoyed it as the difficulty increased. It is a pretty short game though and all the levels can be beaten in a few hours. I found the replayability to be worthwhile.
is, game, wonderful, This, This is a wonderful, *wonderful* game! üòç It is *definitely* worth the few dollars it's sold for. Just FYI: I'm not into trainspotting and I don't geek over train models. I just like looking at metro system maps. Looking forward to more levels üòâ Bangkok, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Busan, Hamburg, Hangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Nagoya, Osaka, Oslo, Philadelphia, Rome, Santiago, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Taipei, Tehran, Tianjin, Toronto, Vienna, Wuhan, Xi'an...

is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game! I always keep coming back to it! It's a pity Mini Motorways isn't on Android. I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR IT.
's, game, lovely, It, It's a lovely game. You get multiple cities for play, all having their own challenges. Three game modes and some maps having an extreme mode. Daily challange, defitently worth the money, glad I bought this.
is, game, favorite, This, This is definitely my favorite game ever! It's so relaxing and fun! I remember when this game was at the indie exhibit at the EMP museum and look at where it is now! I do have one suggestion: I think you should add Boston to the game, that would be a challenging map!

is, port, great, this, I saw a demo of this at MoPop and this is a great port to Android
's, game, great, It, Love the graphics, love the mechanics, love the challenge. It's a great overall puzzle game.
's, game, overall, It, Love the graphics, love the mechanics, love the challenge. It's a great overall puzzle game.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game. But I have a suggestion, Please add more stop shapes and add connected stops.
's, game, designed, It, It's a well designed game and very enjoyable. It's a puzzle game but it is constantly evolving and changing. I like to play it on the tube üòÅ
is, point, whole, which, Doesn't work. The game seems to load fine, but I am unable to make any connections between stations, which is the whole point. I've tried different ways but no dice. Not what I expect when I pay for a game.
's, package, complete, It, The perfect game in every sense: Aesthetically, graphically, aurally. It's the complete package.
is, game, only, This, Incredibly simple game with deep complexity. It's the game devs' dream. This is the only game I have kept on my phone since I've bought it because it's fun and very easy to pick up and put down. I've been playing this game for years and it still feels like there's more to learn, which is astounding because there's not much to the game on a surface level.
is, game, wonderful, it, I love mini metro, I originally got it to play it on my tablet, but upon downloading it to my new phone as well (a Samsung Galaxy A51), I can press on the stations and the colored ring will appear around the station, but no matter what I do, no line appears and they simply won't connect. I would love to give this game a 5 star rating but it doesn't work on all platforms for me! If there is any way I could get some help to fix this I would gladly update to 5 stars, as it is a wonderful game!
be, music, current, anything, Great game! I realy like the gameplay, and the price is worth it since there are no ads or in game payments. So why is it a only four star rewiew then? Well, the music is just bad and it gives me a headace so i have to play without sounds. I would like if you added a decent music, it doesnt have to be perfect, but I feel like almost anything would be better then the current music. Anyway, i realy like the style of the graphics, it realy looks like the subway maps and i like it. Great game! üòÄ
was, scale, difficult, which, Originally played this on my phone, which was sometimes difficult given map scale. Am now playing exclusively on a Chromebook, which makes gameplay much easier.The randomness of map generation can get aggravating, but that gives it more of an arcade feel, which is OK. Fun game overall.
is, game, casual, It, This game is very fun and challenging. It is so much better than other games that are similar to it. It is a casual game and very relaxing, while still challenging players. Get this game immediately! You will have a blastüòå
's, static, same, It, Let us turn off the "music". The background tones aren't always relaxing and are quite repetitive and headache inducing. It's the same pulsing static over and over and gets very annoying. The lowest setting is quiet but not off completely.

's, game, great, It, It's a great game to waste time when needed
is, UX, bad, This, (1) I'm fed up of accidentally hiding the pause button instead of clicking it. This is bad UX. I have no interest in hiding the speed controls. (2) I would love game history (final screenshot + anim; as data this must be tiny) for top score from each map + most recent 10 games. I frequently exit to check achievements and then regret not screenshotting my final network. (3) Google Play description of "Elaborate Dance Number" is wrong.

's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game to play. I really like then Zen mode the most though
is, game, nice, this, Would've loved some more features besides Tunnels, locs, carriages and interchanges but otherwise this is a really nice game. Some of the challenges can be really tricky to complete. That being said I never quite know why I've messed up or what I did wrong when I lose early.
was, addition, great, this, An excellent game concept and design! I love train games in general, and this was a great addition to my games. I love the challenges and that the game plays exactly the same as the other versions (Steam, etc.) This is one of the few games that I come back to over and over again.
is, puzzle, brilliant, this, This game is at once simple and complex. Easy and hard. I love it for that! Don't shy away from the simple graphics, this is a brilliant puzzle.
'm, kid, younger, I, 12/10 game, I'm not a younger kid but I still enjoy this game
is, dollar, best, This, This is the best dollar I've ever spend. Totally worth it. :)
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice little game, keeps ya thinking.

be, 1, best, this, I dont think there is anything wrong with spending money on a game that you're dedicating time to, even if that game happens to be on your phone. People deserve to be paid for their labor! That said, this may be the best $1 I've ever spent, especially on a phone game. The mechanics are simple yet engaging, and the color schemes are just gorgeous. The full game is unlocked for your $1, plus there are NO ADS AT ALL. Give these people your money!
's, game, great, it, The game is not updated for the persistent gestures of andriod 11, it's really frustrating to play right now. Otherwise it's a great game.
be, timesink, great, it, Good fun! Just kinds getting into it but it looks like it'll be a great timesink. I only wish the mechanism to add carriages was a bit more natural, sometimes I'm not sure where I'm dropping things.
is, game, perfect, This, This is a perfect game. You wouldn't want to add anything to it, and you couldn't take anything away. It's just right. The graphics and interface are perfect for mobile devices. The gameplay is simple enough for anyone to understand, yet challenging and rewarding. Classic!
's, game, great, it, This game is the best example of easy to learn, hard to master. My only issue is the controls, it's very hard to press something and not destroy your entire layout. Overall it's a great strategy game.
's, something, new, it, Train go brr but also break my heart :( Seriously tho this game confuses me, I wish I had a dashboard or something. Maybe a single out thing so I can focus on one track, this game is ruthless and unforgiving and dont think for a second that it'll give you a break, it's always something new to crush you and I love it.
is, game, only, This, This is the only game I've ever bought in more than one platform, that's how much I like and recommend it. Got it for PC years ago on Steam, then recently got it again for Android, there's something poetic in playing it on your phone while riding one of the transit networks it emulates.
's, fun, much, it, Very simple and rather immersive. This will cause you to have to recharge you device more often it's that much fun, you'll have a hard time putting it down.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game. I love it! I think it helps you to improve your logical thinking.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game ever. Download it
is, system, Bucharest, it, Awesome game, lots of fun. I have 1 request though, and it is the Bucharest metro system. I really want to play on the Bucharest metro, like other people, I think it would be a really nice addition to the already exceptional game.

is, killer, great, it, This game is worth every penny, it is a great time killer and also requires you to think ahead, would definately recommend.
's, game, fun, It, The game is simply addicting. With such simple interface and gameplay, you have to think the best way possible to line up the railway. You also want to think about line efficiency, somehow as the level progress, the stations will be crowded and you have to move the passengers otherwise the game will over. It's a fun game, but challenging as well.
's, bit, enjoyable, It, I love this game. I've played it for years on my Macbook Pro, and was very excited to find the Android app. It's every bit as enjoyable on my phone as on my computer. Well done, Dinosaur Polo Club!
is, game, fun, It, It is a fun game but somtimes when the trains are not even full or have any one on will stop stations and pick people up. One time i had just stated and the line had 3 stations and the train would not stop at one.
is, game, good, It, It is a good game for me to play while I have free time. However can you guys update the game's map or new features to keep us playing. Thank you for making such a fun game.
be, map, interesting, It, Wish to see my city Kolkata. Although Mumbai is included in the map. Just so that the developers know India's first metro was introduced in Kolkata. Now it is being extended through tunnels under Ganga. It will be an interesting map to play I believe. Would love to see my city!
's, strain, much, it, My experience was overall good, but I'm not sure if this is possible, if you could make a lite version, it's too much strain on my phone sometimes.
is, game, wonderful, This, This is a wonderful game! It requires optimization and problem solving.
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game :)
is, game, brilliant, This, This is a genuinely brilliant wee game. Perfect balance of simple design which leads to complex gameplay. And zero adds. Plz buy. Give them all your money
is, game, best, this, I want to kiss the developer,this is the best game I have ever brought on playstore I have recommended this game to my friends too
's, game, good, It, It's a good game to hone your thinking capabilities but it can devour tons of your time as it's that addictive.
