installed, for, days, Save your money, one of worst games I have played. Free RPG's are far better. Game is boring as hell. Had installed for a couple days. Hope this helps you.
take, off, them, I'm rating a one star because, you can't watch your characters battle, because you're to busy healing, your team dies so easily, that if you take your eyes off them for a moment, they die. Your team also doesn't even try to move out of AoE attacks. English translations are horrible, takes me right out of the story. Lastly, I don't believe anyone working on this game, has ever participated in a raid from an actual MMORPG; or your teammates would move out of AoE attacks, with a quickness. Big F.

working, on, emulator, Game is not working on emulator, Im using noxplayer latest verison..
play, as, healer, Why only play as healer? Love to play as tank or even dps

get, thru, dialog, Nope, not for me. Couldn't get thru the long, boring dialog in the tutorial. Was like reading bad google translate with no end in sight

loading, from, games, Game freezes when inventory is open, and it crashes when loading from google play games, impossible to advance, I emailed a complaint to get a refund but I get always ignored
brings, As, healer, I didn't know I needed this game. As a long time healer in WOW this brings back memories. Highly suggest this to anyone who likes WOW or being a healer.
freezes, for, reason, It freezes constantly for no apparent reason. At first I thought it was just one specific battle but then it started happening so frequently at random times with no battle or even enemies on the screen that I couldn't even play for 10 minutes without it freezing.

found, in, Normal, Very good time-waster, needs improvement. Daily and Nornal dungeons needs balancing. E.g. I gain more gold, equipment, soul points in the Heroic dungeon than in others... while earning hero *s. -Normal dungeons gold gain is abysmal. -Equipment lvs are 1/4-1/5 from Daily Dungeons. -Healer equipment is roughly 1/2 the lv and is rarely found in Normal. -Auction and equipment overlays need to be smaller. And most IMPORTANLY, I can only keep the game open for 1 minute before phone sleeps.

change, with, another, It's a 8 out of 10 for me right now... Wish you could change the healer with another... Also wish the items changed the appearance of the characters... Oh and wish you could have 2 tanks not just one... It's to limiting in ways. Other then that it is fun to auto battle and hang out while playing it feels a bit like playing WoW dungeons but on a battle to battle style. Definitely worth the buy tho.

have, in, background, Game do not work. I have only black screen and music in background.
bugs, after, minutes, Seems fun but the sound bugs out after 5 minutes of playing, with unbearable sounds coming from my speakers

get, past, that, Pretty fun, lots of customization and always feel like you're making progress. Bad tutorial is the main thing holding this back, get past that though and it's quite fun.
get, at, times, A really good take on raid simulation. The AI of your team mates is fantastic, the healing action is really fun, and the amount of loot and characters is enough to keep you interested for a hundred hours. It’s also a partial idle game as the game has an auto mode you can turn on to make the healer play herself for you. The game does get repetitive and mindless at times as you have to turn auto on to go through the motions while getting through easy stuff before moving on to real challenges.

upgrading, of, gear, An amazing game that keeps giving. IAP totally unnecessary. 49 heroes to collect, simply by progressing (took me 7 days). Endlessly upgrading of gear (by acquiring new gear and enhancing). In the beginning the fights are short, the more difficult it gets, the longer they last. Absolutely recommend this game if you enjoy progressing all the time. Real healer feeling and sense of accomplishment. Don't think about it, just get this game already!! Thank you dev for this gem :)

gets, after, hour, Very bad English, bad mechanics, gets boring after about 1 hour
liked, in, MMOs, Great gameplay, definitely gets that "support" kick if you liked healing in MMOs. Be warned, combat feels like it lasts 3 to 8 seconds. If dev could add a slow-down feature, also slowing casting times, it would cause me to never put down my phone.
feature, for, etc, need pvp mode and ad view feature for extra money etc.
feels, like, mmo, I absolutely love this game. Can be very challenging at times and also very frustrating lol. Love the fact it feels like an mmo but, it's not (tried it offline) and you can still recruit. Also talent/skill points are very hard to obtain especially as you upgrade skills/talents. My other problem with this game is. You can promote all heroes to 7 stars but, you have no way of promoting your main character Lexia (healer) beyond 5 stars. I hope this gets released in future updates. Hence the -1*

feels, at, moment, Why the fights only last 2-5 seconds? Slow them down a bit because at the moment it feels more like a racing game...

raiding, for, loot, Loot! GREAT value for the money if you love raiding for loot!
find, about, game, I wish I could find more info online about this game! Great game though. :)
feels, like, mmo, JUST BUY IT!! SKIP YOUR COFFEE TOMORROW AND GET IT! LOVE THIS GAMES TAKE ON MMORPGS RAIDING. Amazing game even though its single player it's feels more like an mmo them any other "mobile mmos"
play, on, 7Pro, Looks interesting but... I cannot play it on my OnePlus 7Pro. The sound and graphics look like slow motion and has an echoing sound.

stuck, with, heroes, The latest update makes it impossible for me to enter the heroic dungeon, it uses up a key but the party invite prompt never shows up. Effectively stuck forever with the same heroes.
go, through, stages, Wish i can control level for random hero dungeon. It is so hard to succeed if i go through too many stages while getting 1 to 2 star heroes
needs, in, readability, Wasn't worth the price. Huge battery drain. UI needs improvement in readability.
messed, In, terms, Really awesome game love the idea and is executed pretty well my only problem is lack of updates, bug fixes and events. I wish there were some online features as well somethijg like a leader board system and other small online aspect stuff seeing a pvp arena would be pretty sweet. In terms of bug corrects jin's details page is all messed up for me nothing like the other detail pages, for the dungeons abort doesn't always work at the start screen and my character image sometimes just goes blue

start, depending, level, Amazing app and worth the money. The game may start out rough, depending on the players individual skill level& ability to understand the tutorial. Once the controls are figured out, you'll either have a blast, want a refund, or it'll be that once in a while game. You're a healer, joining a new raid group after their last one bailed. Show them what you got!

upgrade, to, stars, Love this game it brings me back to my World of Warcraft raiding days. Definitely not P2W. Well designed and balanced except for the issues below. EDIT: There needs to be a way to upgrade the healer to 7 stars like the rest of the players. Since the healers gear only comes from the Gold Dungeon, they fall behind the other raid members quickly. As they are the main character it is a pain that they become the weakest link and cause wipes most because they are the hardest to gear and cant be upgraded.

switching, between, Bluetooth, Good pocket sized game. Sound crashes on one+7pro, but switching between Bluetooth and speaker solve it temporarily. Any chance to fix it?
repeats, at, difficulty, Surprisingly very fun! Really good time killer. There are tons of heroes and equipment to collect. It gets a little repetitive since after world 7+, it repeats world 1 but at a harder difficulty. Unfortunatelt, there are also a few bugs that will crash your game. Overall, a good game. Highly recommended. Best $2.99 I spent on googleplay so far!

started, with, size, Everything happens too fast. The only way to win is to turn on Auto mode and then the game isn't really anything special. I think it would be tons better if you started out with a smaller party size and slower battles so you could practice and get the hang of things.
Confused, at, first, Confused at first but once you know how it works, pretty fun.
easing, into, spells, Confusing to start. No real tutorial. No easing into spells or game play.
run, from, boss, Fights are too fast, sometimes only a few seconds. I can't really heal much when the fight ends that quickly. Then I just watch the characters run from boss to boss. I feel like a spectator more than the healer at times. The game was okay for a few hours, but I have no urge to play it again.

take, into, dungeons, Totally a hidden gem. Some small annoyances, like grammatical errors, or the auction system. You have to share loot with what appears to be other players' characters in the gold dungeon (the best loot drops). And the dungeon system. While interesting, it's a shame you can't just take your own squad into the special dungeons. Seems like a pointless limiter with the actual level of content here. Other than those hangups, this is pretty cool!

adding, in, function, A potentially great game, absolutely destroyed by adding in a full automation function. Nothing you do as a player matters whatsoever, since the auto feature ruins the game by turning it into idle clicker trash. What possessed you to cripple your own game?

got, over, curve, Once I got over the learning curve it pretty good. Going to the gold dungeon is key as it bring gold and high tier items fast. Really no need to change from char to char until you unlock the bulk, look over skills and hand pick the team your gonna use. It fairly light on battery use and fun I recommend it.

Needs, like, loot, Needs few things.. like auto sell grey green loot .. tried to idle overnight in trial but inv filled and I stopped collectong.. a keep going full inv would help too reset trial lvl needed ..atm you start at highest completed or start.. selling say stage 4 of 10 to start would make farming skill pts much better .. only on stage 18 can imagine at stage 50 or 100

says, on, XD, A rough start (which is why not five stars), but otherwise a wonderful little gem that delivers exactly what it says on the tin XD
help, with, game, This is a whole new concept on the element of RPG gaming. And ive been a heavy RPG fan since way back in the super nintendo days when square soft was actually square soft lol. And ive been a beast ass healer in more than one MMORPG as well. But even that past practice doesnt really help with this game. Its really overall a simple dungeon floors type RPG. But the whole set up of how you build has me a bit intrigued. Well worth the 1$ i spent to get it.
Thank, for, game, Despite translation issues this is an amazing simulation of being a main healer and wrangling a party. Thank you for this game!
up, to, star, very nice game. i have question, how to up healer to 6 star? i never see soulstone healer in heroes mode so far is nice game but very small font in description item/hero/equipment. my Phone 5.7inch
running, in, WOW, Really excellent. Not greedy developers. Reminds me of running heroics in WOW
healing, through, dungeons, Amazingly innovative and fresh take on mobile games. Gives a satisfying feeling of healing a raid team through end game dungeons. IAP is available but 100% not needed and I dont mean if you play for years you will eventually get everything. All currency is abundant for free. The IAP is really just for people who want to support the developer or simply max characters immediately. This is not what you expect from a 2$ Title, even in its infancy this app is worth $9.99+ for the current content.

load, from, bluestack, Good concept, but need more polish, items and heroes are badly orgnized, a tons of items are not useful. and cloud save dont seem to work. i cant load the save from the bluestack to the phone.
play, in, mmo, Game is so reminiscent to what we play in mmo! So much memories and fun. 4 stars because I up the star of my hero to 4s using diamonds but apparently it's not permanent? It went back to 3s after some time. If the dev can ack this it will be great

committing, to, grind, Pretty fun. Definitely for those who like grinding. That said, committing to the grind makes it virtually IAP free.
runs, from, encounter, Would give this a 5 star, because I love the concept and love the gameplay. But the way the game works is your party runs from encounter to encounter and those runs take some time, made worse by the party members who are short with short legs they take longer to get there. The only issue I have yet because sometimes the AI pathing makes that run even longer. Although I will give it's fairly true to the aspect of having to run. Just gets tiring having to see it so much. Perfect otherwise so far.
respond, to, email, Very light on content. Not very well balanced. Progression is slow and unclear. Dev does not respond to email.
recommend, to, those, This game rocks! It has constant updates that further polish the experience. Heavily recommend to those looking for an mmo-style dungeoning experience!

restart, from, beginning, Waste of money. Gameplay is nonsense and there is basically no tutorial because translations are so bad nothing is properly explained. Closing the game or dying makes you restart from the beginning, UI and controls are crappy and cluttered. Stay away from this game.
playing, for, days, Dont buy this game , been playing for days now and can never get pass 1-8. Upgrading gears and lvling up characters seems to do nothing. Game got grindy in the first 10min as you cant make it far at all. I want a refund.

feels, like, something, This really feels like something different and fresh. Even the "gold dungeon" is a clever change. It could benefit from some quality of life additions though: Auto equip button and mass selling of items.

guide, to, sometime, Good game,is there a tip,forum or guide to any heroes?also sometime when using time stop ability seem to crash.
play, as, game, It's a great game, different than most others. Barely a tutorial, so you will need to spend a bit of time figuring out a few things. You can play most of it as a pure management game, or go into manual mode as the healer which is very fun. I was pleasantly surprised when I promoted my first teammate at the visual upgrade. The team AI is actually smart enough to move out of damage, the tank can pull aggro, healer on auto does a half decent job.

The team AI is actually smart enough to move out of damage, the tank can pull aggro, healer on auto does a half decent job.

Stuck, at, rebirth, Stuck at rebirth 5. No sense of progression whatsoever. The enemy will instakill anything at one particular moment and can be a squashy mush in other. I like the gameplay and all, but this bug is keeps me replaying in rebirth 5 for almost a month

leads, into, future, This is a fantastic MMORPG raid implemention. I'm excited to see where development leads into the future.
played, on, mobile, I haven't played an RPG like this on mobile. It's a very good simulation of healing in an MMO but with a little guild management thrown in as well. I really like this game. I just wish that I understood it better. The tutorial is quick (which is good) but feels incomplete (which is not good). The game is lots of fun though, as long as you have the patience to explore what it has to offer. It is definitely worth much more than the $2 price tag.
found, to, exit, This game is awesome. Clever idea and super fun implementation. I installed yesterday and there's already updates! Questions: (NVM I found the sell all buttons and the options to auto exit after dungeons!).

progressing, through, dungeons, A fun management game which simulates an mmo experience where you are healing a party and progressing through dungeons. From my time playing it I have not hit any paywalls and find the game interactive enough to be entertaining and enjoyable. I will update my review if this game becomes a cash grab. A note to the developer, if you could please allow us a way to see the spells and debuffs that the enemy bosses cast that would help. Overall though, I enjoy that there are so many different abilities in the game. Additionally, adding more zones would be beneficial.
