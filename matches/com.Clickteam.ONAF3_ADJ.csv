game, cool, Very cool game! I didn't know this game and that everyone was nostalgic to it until now. I'm sad that it's the last game, but I hope the community of the FNaF and ONaF will encourage and help you make more games of the ONaF franchise so that ONaF will be continued!

bug, crashing, Thanks for fixing the crashing bug. I had already beaten the game on another phone I have, and this game was amazing! Although I didn't really like how on Hard Boiled Mode, or normal mode, there's a chance that Birthday Boy Blam and Grunkfuss can enter the hallway at the exact same time, making it almost impossible, especially on HBM, to get rid of BBB. This can also happen with Eyesaur, but hes beatable because he doesnt attack as fast. Beside that, excellent game and port!

egg, funny, This game good. It has funny egg.
game, Awesome, Awesome game! I love the mechanics and it's super easy to move around and check cams quickly. I haven't experienced the bug people yet where you get frozen at some point. Although if I go to recent tabs and go back in I get serious lag. Other than that, great game and really not a disappointing third entry to the series! Keep up the good work, guys!

effects, sound, Pros: The game style is good, there are no ads, you don't have to pay foe anything in-game, the jumpscares are good, the sound effects are great, the game is well made. Cons: Sometimes the game lags, you have to pay on phone but not on PC.
update, new, The new update has thankfully fixed the game, thank you Clickteam for making another great game üéÆüëç

screen, rhe, Let me put this in details for you guys to understand. The game shows rhe loading screen then closes the app from it crashing. Thats all there is.
Job, amazing, MY GOD this is frickin amazing the amount of difficulty is great and you have to be very attentive on everything,I like how grunkuss can get in the way but is balanced because he is fast,You did an amazing Job on the creation of everyone and everything,Nothing is unfair (flumpty) and it's balanced,I haven't experienced bugs which is good,But aside that,I loved it you have no idea how much people waited for this,I hope you have a great day and try to relax aswell (and Hi Scott)

game, Great, Great game but at 4am and 5am it is very stressful
time, cracking, A cracking good time
time, good, A cracking good time
time, next, As of now, the game can't even get to the warning screen without crashing. I know this is already being fixed, but next time can you please test this on smaller devices so we don't get deceived from these crashes. (Update: the game works perfectly fine now. I works perfectly and the 2nd half of the game is so intense. Definitely give this a try.)

fangames, other, I love this game and the mechanics, great send off to the story, can't wait for the other fangames!
night, main, This completely exceeded my expectations. The main night itself is just as good as ONaF 2, but the twist halfway through is what really makes the game. Never before in a FNaF game have i ever wanted to replay a night over, and over, and over again.
atmosphere, Nice, The game is great. Nice atmosphere, nice scares. This is an amazing game, great job!

game, new, The game keeps crashing when I try to load it but this is expected from such a new game.
lag, due, The game has lag so the jumpscare animations sometimes take long due to that lag and they feel wonky and boring to sit through, other than that good game
