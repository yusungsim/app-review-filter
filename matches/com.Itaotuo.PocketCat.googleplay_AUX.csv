was, puzzler, shallow, it, I absolutely implore you to play this. I nearly skipped it, assuming it was yet another shallow "puzzler", but... This is a subversive masterstroke.

was, game, great, It, I was loving this game, but as I'm deaf i can't play some of the puzzles and takes a while to realise its the sound you need for a clue. Ive looked at walkthroughs but its not working on the computer morse code sequence? Not sure if the code is randomised?? Could you make it vibrate at least?? It was a great game otherwise, but now i can't progress.
's, game, fantastic, It, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! No spoilers, but let's just say the game gets a little "sus" (in the best way). It's a fantastic point-and-click puzzle game with excellent artwork, an original story, and unique, original puzzles (which is very impressive for a point-and-click). The difficulty can be pretty challenging, though it's mostly fair without relying on nonsensical "point-and-click logic" for what items get used where. There aren't any hints, but App Unwrapper has a helpful walkthrough on YouTube.
