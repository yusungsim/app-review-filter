way, only, Worth my money, as its fun to play with friends. The reason i gave it 4 stars thoight, is beacuse you need "minecoins" for almost everything, and the only way to get them is by spending money. Please give starter players at lease 200 minecoins to start with, beacuse we have already paid fpr the game, why do we need to play for the curency to? untill then my review stays the same.😐

joystick, virtual, It's Minecraft on your phone, which is awesome. I only wish there was an option for a virtual joystick, because the D-pad feels so clunky. Great game though, with endless creative fun. Well worth the price.

world, new, 👏AMAZING GAME 👏 but there's one problem one time I made a new world and when I hit mobs they flew and slowly fell down. But I definitely recommend this game 🎮🕹 and one more thing when you sign in can there not be so many sites? I'm sorry about my behavior it's just I'm kind of mad because my mom has this app that which blocks sites and I need permission from her.

game, good, It's over all just pretty good game and it's basically olmost as what u would get on a console or a monitor but only problem whit it is that when I start to look around it starts to break stuff cuz that's what it thinks I'm trying to do

game, Best, Best OG game out there. Full.stars.
game, good, I practically grew up with this game. It's shaped me a lot, and I'd be lying if I said it weren't a good game. I also don't get why people get mad at the micro-transactions, as it isn't like EA where you have to pay to get better at the game, they're just texture packs and skin packs that barely affect the gameplay. You're also not forced into buying anything. Sure, the game has a few glitches and bugs, but that's mostly when you're in a beta version. All in all, I highly recommend this game

challenges, fun, The nether update , made a lot of fun challenges and cool builds. Now the fox update , had cuddly little foxes and a new food source. Finally the the village and pillage update , added new enemies and better textures to the world and the villagers finally get some new upgrades. All in all this is the best game in my opinion... I'm back and you guys are over working yourselves!!! I have seen all the things you are working on like caves and cliffs. Your even making a very unique, scary, deep dark.

game, favorite, Minecraft is my favorite game but, I recently found a shader that I did not like so I deactivated it and uninstalled the app I found it on, and ever since then it hasn't loaded
grade, 4th, It doesn't respond sometimes, but all in all the game is great. Lags here and there, but that was already expected. The features are good and are really fun, but i never finish my builds because im to distracted. Most of my builds are unfinished and i can't deny that i'd rather watch minecraft content than play the game itself, but i love this game, because i grew up with. I've been playing the game since i was in 4th grade and altgough i don't play as much it still holds value to me.
world, new, I personally love Minecraft but today when I created a new world it started to lag and lag even though I have internet still this game does not need internet to work then the game kicked me out I checked on the Google play store many times and I don't see a new update for this app. I really hope that this can get fixed I really do love Minecraft.

game, fun, Minecraft is a fun game, but it may get a bit boring if you play by yourself, but if you play with friends that problem is resolved. The game has some bugs, but what game doesn't.

game, favorite, The game is great, I love it its litteraly my favorite game, although, I have 2 small issues, so sometimes I go in minecraft and it signs out of my Microsoft account and I have to struggle signing back in, my other issue is when it does stay in my account the text for speech UI thing will turn on and I don't really like the UI I have to turn off the text for speech everytime I get on.

additions, new, I love all the new additions, but I used to ba able to play this just as well with internet as without it. Now, if I have no wifi or cell service, nothing will load. It's become incredibly frustrating since I live in an area with almost no wifi or service options.

game, great, Minecraft is a great game but the recent updates have released a large variety of bugs that frankly make the game a bit less unenjoyable. Minecarts disappear, villagers gone, tridents that have been thrown despawn or fall into the void. Please fix these problems to make the game more enjoyable so we don't need to fly around our world's checking on all our farms, thank you.

problems, only, 1. I am unable to rename stuff using an anvil. 2. When I write in a book, close it, and reopen it, none of my writing saves. These are my only problems, and they are in my Realm. Just my Realm.
cause, boring, Love the game just pe is so boring cause no mods
problem, weird, I really like this game! But, there is one weird problem. So when I built my house, I left the game for 3 hours, when I came back to check on my house, part of the floor was smashed, the anvil was missing and the stairs were gone. The thing is that I have a brother who can join my world, but when I discovered it, I looked at the chat and no one had joined. This couldn't have been Herobrine because I know he got removed in like 1.16, and this is not the first time this happened to me. Please fix!

game, fantastic, This is a fantastic game, however my only irrational complaint is the devs and support team. Whenever me or anyone I know needs a bit of help and emails em, they ALWAYS respond with this snarky, lazy tone. I know all support teams are like that, but honestly I thought Minecraft would be different. Also they usually aren't helpful at all and the only thing they reccomend is to try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Thank god I tend to he good with computers tbh because they really don't help

reviews, bad, Listen, this game is my favorite and there should be no bad reviews in this game unless you experience very bugs that devs won't fix but other than that this game is very good. Low end devices may experience lag. Especially large servers. Suggested devices IOS & Android 10+ to get stable FPS. I could be wrong about the devices but with my experience these work pretty well.

👌, 😌, Its used to be Very good at first and yesterday it worked perfectly fine. But there is an issue...! Whenever I enter the dressing room it shows this thing so when i click it puts me to playstore and then on the minecraft app on the playstore And so whenever i click the X button it makes me have to wait so Dang long to go back to the minecraft home screen but! It wont put me at the minecraft homescreen at all. This game sucks everyone enjoys it exept for me. 😌👌 also I am racist
REVIEW, BAD, Omg this game is awesome I don't know what I would do with out it! IF YOU LEAVE A BAD REVIEW I SWEAR!!
game, good, I like minecraft its a good game
features, cool, I think it's ok, but Minecraft is dying now. So add more cool features to it. This for the creator or Mojang
way, great, Chat isnt working in Realms. Other than that MCPE is a great way to play Minecraft Bedrock version.
game, best, One if the best game ever played
game, Great, Great game better on pc

mod, new, When is the new mod coming out? Like seriously it's been years since it didn't come out just honest let me now because I am bored in here;_;
games, best, Minecraft is in my opinion one of the best games out there, but, there's a bug or something in the mobile version. I bought this and was really excited to play it, because I can't play when someone else is using the tv or while my computer is broken. When I opened it up, it was fine, normal Minecraft stuff, But when I made and joined a survival world, I couldn't do even so much as make sticks, splitting a stack isn't working and even another user was confused as to why it wouldn't split.

night, last, Hi so last night I was playing Minecraft and I think I may have found a bug. I was in the nether looking for Netheright and all the sudden I died. It said that I died from Lava, but there was nothing there. I lost all of my stuff. Is there any way I can get my stuff back? It's a no cheats survival.
app, great, It is a great app but it would be great if you could add more breeds of dogs, at least a pug dog. But also it is not letting my friends join, it says im not on

skins, multiple, I think it's not fair I have multiple skins for Minecraft to import but can't put them all in. You should make it able to hold more than one.
game, favorite, Wow where do I start, I've been playing minecraft for as long as I can remember and it is still my favorite game and will always be. I just love it, there are so many things that you can do like build whatever you want, explore the world, fight monsters and travel to a different dimension and explore it . There are just a few things that I would love to be added to this legendary game like Excalibur, new bosses, new portals and dimensions and last but not least new mobs mojang thank you so much!

Now I lost my whole survival world and all of my creative worlds where I built lots and lots of hard and time consuming builds. But overall this is a great game and very fun.

💞, good, Nice 👍🏻 Game! Everything is good perfect and comfortable 💞 BUT I gave this game 4 🌟 s cause there should be a tool that can be used to decorate blocks.. I know that there is a mod 'chisel and bits mod' which is only for PC USERS!? I don't like that because mobile users cannot access to that mod 😖 please put a tool that can decorate blocks without any mod like that chisel and bits one.

times, many, Honestly, just don't buy realms, its not worth the money. Just use mulitplayer, replacing worlds are buggy. And there's bug saying that it cannot replace the world. Sometimes the world is transferred over but many times it doesn't. Nice "fix" for the realm.

grass, nice, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.

game, amazing, The games good the graphics are great but the problem is that when I join with my friend it kicks me out over all its an amazing game tysm mojang
complaint, main, Have really enjoyed playing this game! My main complaint is that the axlotyls aren't catchable with the buckets. A glitch maybe? Should anyone need this info tho... as a cheaper version of minecraft: yes, u will get less options on this app. Still great tho. Better than not having minecraft at all. XD

Also I'm not a robot. If your new play on creative🤗

game, Great, Great game but for some reason the music stopped working on mobile
players, most, Good but they raised the price for no reason. This app is not worth 7.49. Put it back to 6.99. 50 cents doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that most players are young.
time, hard, Ita good but hard time logging
game, good, Very good game
games, favourite, Definitely one of my favourite games, however with the new update traveling will be hard, maybe adding something such as a rod (made perhaps from bamboo) that you can use to launch you up a few blocks, like the sport.

game, great, Minecraft is a great game. But there is sometimes an issue when you connect your controller to play. I have had to uninstall and reinstall minecraft to try and fix it. And please make some sort of free version for multiplatform servers. Like having 10 people join and no permanent online and all of that. That would make it even more fun.

fun, so, I love this game its so so fun i can build anything i want with my friends and i have so much fun. It has a lot of glitches, witch some glitches are good some are bad. For instance, when you could glitch pistons so they have no head, but, however it can be used for a glitch to break bedrock. Its very good if you are on Java Edition, but i play on Bedrock Edition so its usless... for me. And I've only found diamonds 2 times in my life, so its realy hard to find diamonds. Ok bye.
