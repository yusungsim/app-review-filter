game, dumbest, Has to been the dumbest game I've ever played
way, nice, A nice way to pass some time
game, nice, Very nice game
thing, same, Just as frustrating as with mouse. Still have yet to find out what's at the top. 10/10 P.S. if you're expecting the same thing as the PC then you're wrong. If you're used to the mouse then you'll be frustrated by the touch controls but you just have to understand that it's a new challenge, just like switching from keyboard to controller on PC.

quotes, many, Ive learned too many quotes
game, simple, Very simple, yet extremely challenging game. If you pride yourself in never "rage quiting" a game, this game will probably give you a run for your money. Have you ever done a math problem where a frog is trying to jump out of a 12ft hole but everytime he jumps up 3ft he then slides down 2.5ft? Well... Same kinda thing but when the frog gets almost to the top, he may slip & fall all the way back down to the bottom, and instead of a frog your a dude taking a bath in a cauldron with a sledge hammer

lol, difficult, still addictive thought the control is difficult lol
controls, better, This game is so damn frustrating!! Need better controls.
occupations, multiple, This game made me cry and try to rip my head off on multiple occupations now I'm a psychopath who wants to murder people best game ever

game, Easiest, Easiest game ever I beat it first try make the game harder HARDER I TELL YOU
game, Great, Great game really enjoyed it.
experience, same, The controls don't facilitate the same PC experience Before I get hated because it's a rage game, let me eexplain. The pc version of this game is awesome. However, the Android version doesn't facilitate exactly the same physics, so things don't quite work right. Overall, the pc version feels like a journey to improvement. The Android version feels like I'm actually being cheated by the physics. I've beaten the Pc version, so I know what it should feel like. Just stick to PC.

learning, hard, I'm all for hard learning curves and punishing game mechanics, I mean I play tarkov, but for Christs sake, put some on screen controls so I can determine what the dude is about to do. The exact same motions can have several different and seemingly random reactions from the character. I haven't played the PC version (I intend to, as I like the games concept) but as far as the mobile version goes, not worth my time.

AF, frustrating, Hard AF but amazing. This game is frustrating AF but THAT'S THE POINT! For all the low reviews telling you that this game is too hard or the controls suck don't listen. This game tells you that it's frustrating and to take breaks and it's right! It's a challenge so suck it up buttercup!

killer, wonderful, Weirdly, I find the controls on mobile to be easier than on PC. Not nearly as frustrating (tho still plenty of cursing and gnashing of teeth - but then, that's the point!). Definitely a wonderful little time-killer, if you can get into the idea of it. Keep in mind that the game is not meant to be easy and you'll learn to love it.

port, mobile, I understand it's a rage game and that's part of the fun, but god the controls are garbage on mobile. Your hammer behaves as if it has a mind of its own because you have next to no accuracy with your fingers, which cover part of the screen anyways. This game is great on PC, since you have that accuracy with a mouse. However a mobile port just wasn't necessary. You almost need a pen to even get past the first obstacle

version, mobile, I have played the PC version and the mobile version is horrible. My hammer clips through objects and sometimes I lose control of the hammer as it spins around wildly Edit: After playing just to see the extent of the problems I found out that surfaces tend to be very slippery compared to the PC version and lag occurs that can throw off your "footing". I would just stick to the PC version because mobile controls aren't bad because they're designed to be bad but bad because they're bad.

game, good, Frustratingly a good game
view, wide, Played this years ago. Now I got it for the phone. Honestly, phone edition is crazy hard. No wide view, controls feel a bit more stiff. Still excellent with 5/5 rating from me
times, multiple, I came to figure out this game is setup their is no actual winning this game their is multiple times i would not touch the screen an id fall for a random reaso

controls, done, Have played on PC and now phone. The shittily done touch controls turned an already frustrating game into something completely unplayable.

experience, Great, Great experience and hard as nails, though I think even for the point of the game being to be hard, the rock next the red metal platform is ridiculously slippery compared to the other rocks, making it a more unrealistically forced annoyance, but beside that it really is an awesome game.

man, perfect, its perfect a man somehow born in a pot and sometimes swings for no reason climbing a mountain to space and what makes you fall is ur anger be calm take it easy
curve, steep, Look, im not even done with this game, and I can tell you, this game is amazing, it's challenging, and while the controls have a horrifically steep learning curve, I've been handling it well. This game is great use of time, despite it's difficulty, as it helps one deal with difficulty, and that is something everyone needs

game, worst, The worst game ever. ON PURPOSE!
game, great, It is a great game the consent is fun but the controls are really stupid like il be using the Hamer and then it will go from up to down without me even touching it
game, fun, It really is a fun game, but you really need to put on a control options.
curve, learning, Don't listen to people complaining about the controls. Yes it is hard and has a learning curve and that's the point. The point isn't really to beat it, it's how you respond when you lose. You can see the passion put into every piece of terrain, Everytime you fall the developer hits you with a philosophy line. One of the most challenging games I've ever played, it's rewarding to see yourself improve with each run. What took you 2 hours one day might take you 5 min the next. This should be 5/5

game, bad, I dont need to explain why is it a bad game but its still a goodgame
section, vertical, As someone who was able to (somewhat consistently) progress past the vertical tunnel section near the start of the game on the PC version, I found myself unable to make it past that section after over a half hour of trying. I kept tweaking the control settings, but it's always either way too sensitive, not sensitive enough, or somehow both. I hated the way that torque scales based on the speed and acceleration of your mouse on PC, but on a phone with touch controls, it is actually unplayable.

masterpiece, Amazing, Amazing, absolute masterpiece. So much detail and creative sections. Sure sometimes I would find the music annoying when I fell, but that just makes the whole experience better. Will play again.

game, damn, I bought the damn game and it took my money then proceedes to tell me to buy it again
game, nice, Very nice game But very frustrating 😕
layer, unnecessary, A game for people who need to up the amount of stress and frustration in their lives. Runs smooth. The controls add an unnecessary layer of frustration however, which made me pass on it.
port, decent, A surprisingly decent port.
sense, false, Terrible. Awful. I hate it. Which is why I rated 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to do. Right from the start, the game tells you, you might beat it, you might not. It doesn't give you a false sense of security, it literally tells you, don't get your hopes up: No amount of forward progress is guaranteed. It tells you the game will make you mad and it encourages you to take breaks if you get too frustrated. This game is so much more than a rage game. It's a valuable life lesson.

game, fantastic, This game is fun with a Carolina reaper on top. It's strange you stress about falling you fall you chill out and just go with it you get to the top. The controls could be a little better but I think that's how Bennett intended it to be. But overall it's worth the 8 bucks and with no adds its just a fantastic game. I definitely recommend buying it😁

game, fun, Please make a joystick control option for this i don't like how all the swiping is locked to the hammer, yes it is okay but because of the controls I got all the way to the 2 buildings near the top of the crane then got pushed off back to the start its a fun game but please add different types of controls so we can try get a feel for a different types of play styles

players, hardcore, I beg everyone DO NOT PLAY THIS PEICE OF TRASH GAME. It is only for the extremely hardcore players. Or else, you will go insane.
game, decent, The controls are okay not bad but not good but can be annoying at times sometimes it feels like the game just freezes a bit time to time but rarely happens But without talking about the cons the game feels fun to play and a decent game to play while bored even if it can make you angry either from the controls or the game
stuff, more, It's really good and fun but they should add more stuff like a item shop
quality, good, It isn't worth the price to be hinest it has good quality but the controlls suck for a mobile player over all it is just a bad game i am not trying to be rude

man, top, Frustrating but rewarding you just want to prove to yourself you can do it LOL don't get me started on watching The rage clips on youtube it'll just encourage you more and you will rage more and more! LOL but when you make it to the top man is it worth it. And always impossible and literally like the first game I've downloaded with no bugs

thing, only, The only thing this $hit wants to do is not cooperate with your £uking finger, bounce off of things and push downwards to the bottom. Play the PC version because you have a mouse to easily use, unlike the mobile version which is ¢rap!

update, last, Almost a year since last update seems Bennet forgot about his game! Devs dont listen and with no updates how can you provide the best gaming experience! No update means the app can not perform as needed with the new technologies and updates! Someone needs to inform noodlecake and Bennet of this because it seems they don't understand why there is updates! Waste of money in my personal opinion. No updates, no leadearboards, no boosts, this game falls short in today's gaming world.

game, good, This game is amazing and rage also but very very very very good game
challenge, fun, This game would probably be a fun challenge except I keep getting this game breaking bug that causes my character to spin his hammer wildly in counter clockwise circles launching me back to the beginning of the game regardless of my progress.
combination, perfect, I broke my phone while playing this game but I still would 100% recommend it to you its the perfect combination of difficult but fun and it's a game you can sit on for hours.
type, certain, Really enjoyed this game. It is probably for a certain personality type... I managed to do it on Samsung S8 but I think Steam and mouse might be a more convenient input setup. I can confirm though it IS possible :)

game, difficult, Legitimately the most difficult and infuriating game I have ever attempted to play, in all the best ways. May have finally found the game that causes me to snap a $1300 device in half. Well played.

fun, frustrating, It fun but frustrating still fun though
game, best, SuperB ..! I these just a best game that really hard to play
rate, ill, Controls suck add mouse compatability then ill rate higher
reason, only, This game is really fun and controllable because i know I've been raging on this game over my skills but the only reason why I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because this game is not free and I think all people should able to experience the game and I don't think people should waste money on a game that's gonna last days if you're that trash at the game

grab, obvious, I wanted to give this game a try again on mobile, and regretted it almost immediately, and now can't get a refund for it. The game is good on pc and I've beat it around 100 times, but porting it to mobile is an obvious cash grab. The game doesn't work on mobile, it's impossible to play like you can on pc. Bennett, I hope you personally read this and understand how greedy this is, and that you're a bad developer for it.

controls, bad, People keep saying the controlls are bad and I also saw one that said it's impossible on mobile. The game is intentionally hard with purposely bad controls. Also the game is very possible. I have beat this game on mobile 25 times and 7 on pc. Both versions are the same mountain with mobile being harder, but still possible. Took me 8hrs to beat my first time, and now I average 13min.

game, good, This game is absolutely broken. I got my hammer stuck in the ground FOREVER. I want a refund and it makes sad that a really good game could get absolutely ruined because people are cheap and want to make not deserved money.
💯, 😊, This game is nice for people with a lot of patience otherwise you'll break your phone. 😊💯
reviews, negative, Don't listen to the negative reviews of this game they are just from people who have no clue what they are doing. This game is very difficult, and it is supposed to be that way. 5/5 stars, would recommend to anyone without anger management issues.
device, good, I would give five star rating but it seems that when I reached the region where sky turns orange I don't know why. Game starts to lag..... Even I have good device If it Wasn't compatible on my device then it should lag in the beginning butvit only lags in oeange sky region. Please take a look at this...... :)(

reviews, other, most of the other reviews on this game are dumb ngl. People dont realise this is supposed to be hard, controls are supposed to be dificult, theres no leaderboard cuz its made to be able to be played offline, everything about this game is fine. People are just uneducated about what theyre buying. Its a great game, easy 5/5 stars.

peaks, tallest, I love how its such a challenge and to me thats the point of the game to test your ability to work from nothing to climb the tallest peaks and every time you fall its give you a memorable historical sentance sooo goood 😁😁😁👌👌👌😁😁😁👌👌👌😍.

lag, little, Aside from the phone screen friction, and a little lag here and there, the game works great! Very fun and intriguing as long as you know how to stay calm and relaxed.
time, big, It's fine. What you would expect from this game on mobile. Not impossible to play. Definitely need to fix the controls big time tho. Should make the control more like a loose analog, not just free for all on the screen.

movements, precise, No controller support. Game is OK but trying to make precise movements with the touch controls is a nightmare.
complaint, biggest, Is this game worth $5? Nope. My biggest complaint is that the controls are terrible. Granted it's a mobile game so you shouldn't expect much anyway, but it's extremely frustrating to get past certain parts only to get launched in the opposite direction because the controls are either unresponsive or over sensitive. The only plus side is that this game is free with the play pass so you don't have to waste your money to try it out if you have that.

option, same, This is such a scam I paid 5dollars but it didn't even download it just showed the same buy option and it won't let me refund so we're the refund? I might just sue you
reviews, poor, This game is pretty addictive. There are poor reviews for functionality and responsiveness, and where they may be right, its still a good game. There are issues with the hammer not moving while mid-air to catch yourself, it just feels like it was made that way. If you go into the game expecting a challenge, let me tell you its well worth it. The creator made this game difficult and those reviews who complain about certain aspects are just complaints. There are ways to overcome the bugs. 💯

people, intelligent, He made the game to hurt you.... it's a frustration numbing agent. Genius! You will get used to falling as part of life is itself. Only intelligent people will understand this and source this element of love from the creator. This is why he said "I made this game for a particular type of person." Most Capricorns will understand the hard climbs we take all the time are just part of the game.

shooter, 3D, The controls are attrocious. You might as well play a 3D shooter programmed by a blind man. Fix the controller support?

test, Fantastic, Fantastic test of patience and determination. I love it!
problem, real, i like the game in general the real problem is that sometimes you charecter moves itself which makes the game annoying and can sometimes screw you up. very difficult but that is what makes the game more fun.
lines, written, This game is absolutely beautiful. Between the well written lines created by Bennett, and the more quotes from others that truly inspires you to keep moving forward. This game is very difficult, but that just makes the ending so much sweeter. I highly recommend this for anyone who's up for a challenge, because this game keeps you on your toes!

weirdness, crazy, Super duper crazy weirdness. If you like this game, you will like it, and if not, you won't. Recommended for people who have taken philosophy 101, or LSD. Preferably both, I guess.

version, mobile, Be warned, if you find this game difficult on PC, the mobile version is like playing Dark Souls for the first time, blindfolded, with your feet, using a trombone as a controller. Why? Because touch screens were not built for controls like this. You rub your finger quickly over the same spot over and over and you lose what little fine tuned control you have (if you had any at all). Had to turn the stupid quotes off. PC version is fine and easy, this version is trash

adjustments, minute, This game DESPERATELY needs controller support! The controls are so unrefined in this game. Also, I lowered my 3 star review because I found out that this game isn't completable on mobile. The controls don't allow you to make minute adjustments to your angle, and as a result players can't pass the first diagnol cave near the start of the game. And before you say anything, I already know how to complete it, and I've already tried many times over. Just take my advice get the PC version instead!

I would recommend updating it and give it something that makes it better this game sucks noodle cake studios it just sucks it has nothing

game, amazing, Its an amazing game
game, fun, There's a difference between a fun game that's hard, and a boring game that's hard. This game attempts to be the former, but fails miserably.

game, good, I need you to understand that the quality of a game is ultimately measured by the enjoyment/dopamine that a player gets. Saying that being frustrated is the point of a game is not going to get you a good game. Also, 50% of the time, The guy with the hammer does a different thing than what I told him to do, meaning that failure is sometimes at the fault of the game, not the player. No game should do this, no matter the point of it. This game is and will always be, a bad game.

bit, little, Definitely as challenging, stressful, and frustrating as I was expecting. The controls could be refined just a little bit further to allow for more precise movement. Definitely a lot of fun as far as mobile games go. Excellent work.

failure, new, This is game is not frustrating. It's as Bennett Foddy says we create the mountain in our attempts to reach the summit. Every time I fall I know that when I make it back up I will feel better. This game is similar to celeste in that regard. In that game its the death count. In this it's falling. In a game like this when you fail you learn how to prevent this new failure. In celeste the first time I beat it I died over 1000 times. Now i can beat with less than 40. You can feel great relief then.

textures, amazing, I've seen alot of youtubers play this game and they always rage, personally I didn't rage at all because it was a fun with amazing textures
series, unique, If you've ever wanted a unique series of cramps in your hands and fingers, this game is for you. You know it's a good game when it makes you mad but also makes you wanna keep playing. It's a quality game for the price, and translates quite nicely to mobile. Pro-tip: mess around with the sensitivity and input acceleration to better suit your gameplay experience. It won't make the game easy, but it will make it easier. Also, PHYSICS.

game, great, Absolutely what i expected, a great game. There is the issue of your finger being in the way but i believe thats just an extra level of added difficulty to an already insanely hard game. You can get used to it though, easier if your more than a casual mobile gamer.

settings, lowest, Do not buy this, it is super laggy, even on the lowest settings, the hammer doesn't even work right lmao. Found out how to fix some of the probs. Screen record with show touch makes its much less laggy for me and wayyyy more responsive.

movements, minor, Used to be decent. Control system has been changed and is now overly gittery and chaotic. They seemed to add an assist system so minor movements will result in massive movements even with minimal sensitivity. No way to change controls, should have an option for a joystick mode instead of what they have. Would not recommend until they revert the changes. Uninstalled

game, decent, The game itself is pretty interesting but if your not the patient and gentle kind, then I wouldn't really recommend this game to you. Overall it's a decent game with a simple purpose . (That is to obviously get over the mountain.) 3 starsl because I suck at it.

journey, fun, Such a fun journey. I cannot explain the amount of happiness and how content I felt at the end. This took me over 3 months to finish but it was very worth it. I actually play the game when im stressed. The sounds are almost ear-candy and the backround ambience is very relaxing. One thing I would add is the option to enable motion blur as I quite like it and some higher-end devices could probably handle it.

level, 2nd, Ok I guess, But i can't pass the 2nd level, at that point the game flicks you offa ledge and when that happended it said oof
interface, better, This game is DIFFICULT. BRUTAL. I recommend playing this on steam. Mouse is an infinitely better control interface than phone touchpad. Love it though.
graphics, good, Ah hell nah man I try this game and gg no one will win this game whatever he did everything is good graphics and controls but soo hard
game, mobile, I think this works better as a mobile game. It's better to play it in small doses. Really satisfying to reach new landmarks on the mountain. Beware the jumpscare.

game, great, it's a great game and I'm just not good at things like this, but I have 2 complaints. it flings me at the speed of light with one wrong swipe and I cant control the hammer sometimes. other than that it's really good and I recommend it.

way, only, This is a frustratingly difficult at times game when using a mouse and keyboard. Touch controls could cause you to need blood pressure medication. I only gave it a 3* because the game itself is good. Just don't play it on mobile unless it's your only way or you're a massochist.
time, first, Dang, this game has been quite the journey. Gave up the first time I tried it and I picked it up again around 3 weeks ago. Was determined to finish it this time and I finally managed to. I love this game's design and aesthetic, and I love how such simple controls can create such dynamic situations and gameplay. Also, despite what I've seen elsewhere, I actually found the commentary to be a great addition. The controls are a bit wonky sometimes, but overall would totally recommend getting it!

For pushing you to your limit making you realize levels of frustration you never have guessed you could have experienced. This game holds a deep meaning that its difficulty contributes to. And if you're beating this on mobile as your first play through then beating it makes you feel much more accomlished than if it were easier. Everything has a place, even if it's not purposefully that way.

game, Unforgiving, Unforgiving game about climbing a mountain. Enjoyment on this game very much depends and how well you persevere and handle setbacks while a voice is egging you on. Very good port for the mobile, there are some inherent extra frustrations due to you sometimes covering too much of the screen due to touch controls but the game experience and feel translates suprisingly well.

anger, much, Its very hard not to give this game 1 star simply because of how much anger it brings me. But thats the point its supposed to be stupidly hard and super frustrating and it does so very well.
love, nice, I like this game is very nice love it
GAME, HARD, Okay, so the thing is, I've beaten this game twice now. Once on PC, and once on the Iphone 7. It's a HARD GAME, so understandable a lot of people leave bad reviews saying "oh the controls suck" and like, its really just them wanting to place blame on something. But since I have beaten it twice on two different platforms, I can honestly say, the android control are really BAD. Great game! Hard game, and I'm still gonna try and beat it. But, why does the iPhone have better controls? Lol

version, good, The good version of annoying
concept, original, The game is really hard but still, it's great. It has a original concept and nice design. It's very unique in its play style. Good game overall. (Exept when you fall to the beginning again)

attempts, unsuccessfull, After weeks of unsuccessfull attempts at scaling an impossible construction with a sledgehammer whilst trapped in a couldron of infinate water I have no choice but to accept that the simple mechanics, the singular goal and the constant beratement for failure makes this game a unique charm to play.

section, first, "Bennett shut the f*** up" is one of the thousands of things that I've said while playing this game, if you don't want to get mad or frustrated I suggest you don't play this game it is very difficult just getting past the first section.
game, nice, Very nice game
person, patient, Honestly, being a patient person to a great degree, this game is inspiring, challenging and humorous. However, I don't agree with the slightest mistake putting the player ALL the way back at the bottom. If people are willing to give the game a chance, then at least give them some hope and incentive that their efforts won't be totally in vain.

person, angry, This game is so frustratingly fun. I'm a very angry person and this game surprisingly calms me down. I literally can play this game for HOURS. My only complaint is that the controls are touchy and that can be rather annoying.

game, Interesting, Interesting game. Yeah, I like it. You can concentrate on how you hook the hammer to climb/fly higher up, or you can rely on your blind luck by just spinning the hammer round like a mad man. You probably will feel like screaming if you manage to get within a few pixels of the top, only to fall a great distance down. But the fun is in the journey, not the destination. 5 stars, because it's really good for what it is.

games, most, This game is fantastic at what it's ment to be doing, and he even let's you refund if you die on the inside, which I did. But I bought the game off steam so don't call me a sissy. This game is astonishing though, which is also proven by the refund policy. (Which most games don't have.) His point isn't to infuriate you, it's to make you work harder so the reward is more fulfilling. If it was as simple as getting over the tree at the beginning then you wouldn't have confidence for barely working.
game, frustrating, This game is just something else. You know it's a frustrating game when your hand gets cramps.
mother, try, It is a MUST try, painstakingly painful, excruciating difficult, notoriously repetitive, meticulously unforgiving, unforgettably memorable, delightfully satisfying, brilliantly crafted, unmistakable unique, completely addictive, mother f'ing of a game!!! Can't wait for a new map or v2. You said it is "designed to hurt a particular type of person" ... I love you and hate you at the same time! Well done ... Just well done!

games, stupid, Now I know every youtuber even markiplier play this game before now is my turn to play this stupid hurting games ever aslo this games is going to be raging and intense.
game, fun, Simply an extremely fun game. It is challenging but that was expected. The controls aren't to bad but can be made better.
game, enraging, Heed my words, my friends. This is the most frustrating, the most infuriating, the most enraging game I have ever played. I have seen many a Youtuber freak out, scream, & even hurl chairs at the wall over this. On mobile, it's much more difficult. But no matter who you are, this will plague you.
game, free, Love game plz free game et multiplayer
game, quick, I've never refunded a game so quick in my life. All I have to say is, its definitely more fun watching other people play it.

game, Nice, Nice game is fun it is so anoing when you are so high up and fall all the way back down
fun, still, The game is a mixture of frustration and fun, every part of the game is near an area where you can lose a lot of progress but its still fun to see how far you can get before you snap. Altogether the experience is like nothing I've seen before, I've also noticed that this company makes a lot of frustrating games. I would recommend to get it if your up for the challenge!

greatness, Solid, Solid greatness can't get enough of it ☺️ not past devil's chimney yet but I'm determined 💪👌
settings, low, I have a phone that can run games like Bully at max settings yet this game at low settings lags like a motherf*cker. Don't waste your time or your money. It's obviously a cash grab with no effort made to optimize it. Touchscreen controls are god awful as well. Skip this one

controls, Bad, Bad controls, and when I got to the lantern part right after the big slippery chunk of metal, there's this small rock you have to get onto, but it was WAAAAY to slippery and I spent about an hour and a half on that part of the game. All I'm asking is to make the rock not as slippery and the lantern vertical tunnel a bit more wide please

master, drunken, Play this. It's like getting used to one orientation on the Xbox and then someone inverts the controls. So learning to play COD with the controls inverted. Maybe it's like a mix between Robinson's gilligans island, Jackie Chan's drunken master, and geometry dash. I'm dyslexic too dev, so special thanks from all of us getting extra fugged. You're creative and sardonic and I like it.

ratings, bad, It's ok t b h the bad ratings is just people getting mad
game, hardest, World hardest dum game
fan, massive, Don't waste your time, I'm a massive fan of the game on pc and have completed it many times But even on the lowest graphics settings this game from 2 years ago still barely runs on a brand new flagship phone. If you own a hypothetical future phone that can run it the experience is much the same as the real version and could probably pass the time pretty well

pot, golden, After 100 wins I didn't get the golden pot
game, Awesome, Awesome game everyone has to play this game
phone, new, Works great, until it doesn't. This game worked great until I got a new phone (Pixel 3a XL) and updated to Android 11, when it proceeded to run at what looks like ~20 fps. It's pretty unplayable at that fps due to the type of game it is. Hopefully this is fixed.
movement, constant, Would easily have my 5 stars if it was compatible with the s pen, the constant movement of my finger on the screen hurts after a while.
game, Good, Good game very frustrating just what I wanted

assemblage, rough, A game inspired by a simple B-Game that came out in 2008, entitled 'Sexy Hiking'. The objective of the game is to simply drag yourself up a mountain using a hammer. The mountain itself is a rough assemblage of seemingly random objects and assets from other games and areas. The player has to make their way up the unforgiving heap whilst constantly being at the risk of falling and losing everything.

movements, precise, I absolutely love this game. Its fun, the commentary is interesting and funny, but its not great on mobile, the controls make your fingers tired and its mich harder to make precise movements, other than that, its worth it's price tag.

changes, big, The game hates you winning the things I could do i can't its like the game won't let you when i completed the game it crashed and wont let me re open thats proving the guy who created gets a kick from you failing and when you win you can't play because you beat the game from a developer point of view there still big changes you need to make before publishing it worst game ive ever played i would rather play the orginal

game, Nice, Nice game...but controls sucks May be I'm new to this so felt like that think I get habite to it
cells, many, As much as this game is fun and distracting i really think you should rethink it being for everyone, i imagine an 8 year old broke their phone because they were mad they fell, i lost so many brain cells playing this game lol
time, first, Dude..... I am literally playing this game for the first time on the day of my marriage. Luckily, my wife apparently "gets it" in the same way I do; i.e., we both find the concept funny and the gameplay surprisingly absorbing. Thanks. It's nice to have weirdness. It makes the world a more beautifully horrible place.

amount, right, I think it is funny as hell! As intended! Annoying too! Just the right amount!
time, first, k know when people play for the first time they will rage and give the game a 1 star review but when you finish it's sooo worth it TRUST me
time, more, What I expected. Similar to the pc version. Hard but not impossible. Will take more time to get the precision/instincts to make conscious progress rather than maniacly swinging the hammer hoping for luck. I'm going to dread the 🍊

critic, harsh, It's confusing and challenging yet gets a bit zen, I don't want to say too much, that could effect user experience but it has introduced me to the concept of b-games and I'm now quite curious to explore more. I'm also a harsh critic when it comes to ratings and this is close to being a 5 star game based on concept, but the initial frustration with understanding would not let me give 5 stars even though that is part of the game experience. This game made me think.

try, first, I come from the PC version. Took me 2 hours on my first try playing the smartphone version. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I think there can be a few performance improvements that will help the game run better. The entire map and the background can simply be just one big picture file, with layering effects. Diogenes can stay how he is. The focus of the camera can render a part of the area it is focusing on. The game was a bit intensive on my phone. That said, GET OVER IT!! HEHEHAHAHAHA!!

control, consistent, Too laggy to get consistent control on a Pixel 3. I understand that difficult controls are the point of the game, that's why I bought it, but this goes beyond difficult controls into pretty much random behavior on this device. Basically no correlation between input and outcome means that progress doesn't feel earned and setbacks don't feel like they're your fault. Unengaging and unsatisfying.

fun, extra, I love it then I hate it but it will not beat me TT much harder on mobile think it makes it extra fun. play this instead of cutting yourself itself cleaner :)
graphics, great, i hate it so much that i love it. great graphics. every time i fall i just want to keep climbing.
satisfaction, pure, Brought 8 hours if pain, all leading to pure satisfaction after beating it.
issues, temporary, Never have I been so angered in my life ,its addicting but will cause temporary anger issues.
spin, weird, Passes the time. It has a weird spin that kinda starts you all over, but thats to be expected with beta testing. At least it makes it more challenging, which gives you a feeling of accomplishment whenever you pass something. I haven't finished it yet, but it's a fun game, and I'm determined to complete it.

reviews, many, I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews. The game is supposed to be a rage game, and it succeeds at doing that. Very well, actually. If you came here expecting a fun game, you're wrong.

game, simple, Controls are whack don't do what you want them to and for such a simple game, more frustrating than anything else deleted after about 2 mins
game, Good, Good game it's frustrating but worth it
game, hard, This is a hard game but you have to keep going and practice, I hated the game before, but then I realized that not being able to do it was my fault, so for 3 days I kept playing and on the third day today, I beat it and it was super rewarding.

satisfaction, pure, When you first launch the game and start your journey you might think this is easy but trust me 15 hours later and many frustrating falls back to the beginning I finally completed it ,which gave me a sense of pure satisfaction and happiness that I finally overcome the seemingly impossible challenge at times. To sum up I would recommend this this game to anyone with a bit of patience and someone who is looking for a great game well worth it's £5 price tag. Pleasure to play thank you creator.

amount, Good, Moves by it's self a. Good amount
people, other, I find this game's setting oddly relaxing. The music is also pretty neat. While it makes other people rage, I find it relaxing to get over this strange mountain.

GAME, AMAZING, SO CHALLENGING BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S AN AMAZING GAME
scam, massive, The character doesn't respond to the controls (touch screen is broken in-game) I want my money back for this massive scam
pot, Golden, While the game is fun I have a problem. My understanding was that if I beat the game 50 times I would unlock a Golden pot. I beat it 50 times and nothing changed. I then beat it again 10 times and nothing. Why?
game, great, This is a great game
fun, Super, Super fun!
