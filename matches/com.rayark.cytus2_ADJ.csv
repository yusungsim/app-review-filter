game, Great, Great rhythm game. Cool story, and beautiful songs, but steep dlcs. The reason for the four stars is that the recents updates kinda suck, with every update there is an issue like the data loss on Android players just recently.

problem, only, Overall the game is extremely good normally this would be 5 stars for me but the only problem is the cloudsave it isnt that attentive or effective because of that i lost all my progress in story but it really isnt much of a problem i can always replay it but i hope the cloudsave gets a bit more fix so it could work properly

game, best, The best rhythm game I ever played, the gameplay and the story is great(and I almost cry becuz the story...), I have installed this game when it's free and there is also a dlc like character and more, so I was planing to buy the character but my wallet can't take it, and I know there is 60% offer thing sometimes, soo when I can have that discount again?, every new month? Or just when anniversary? I will be very thankful if you can answer this (Also sorry for my bad English)

game, Best, Best music game of all time
game, great, Izza great game, it's just hard to get past alot of level locks unless you buy literally every song pack in the game, or ur just got tier at the game, which I'm far from. I'm also not sure how the xp system works, I think B rank gives the most xp though. Other than that, bumping soundtrack from what I heard myself, most of NEKO's songs are nightcore though so I'm not too thrilled lol. The gameplay is awesome and I prefer it over VOEZ honestly, though I do prefer that game's OST (non-dlc)

purchases, restore, No matter what I've tried, I can't access any of the song packs or characters I've purchased. After reinstalling I got access to Miku again, but all of the others are locked and I can't even access the purchase menu. Please add a restore purchases option to remedy this. The cloud save feature does not seem to be working to fix it

game, wonderful, Well, it's a wonderful game. I have played it for a long time. But recently, the capso I get from each song is less than the before. For the former edition, I can get 1-5 capsos, but now, I just can get it 1 or 2 pieces. Besides, the flexibility of the game is worse and worse.

time, right, I've noticed a bug where I cant seem to hit the notes even tho I press it at the right time, I've had this happen in Ivy's summer zephyr (easy) and Robohead's midnight (easy), please fix this soon I'm trying to MM all the songs and the songs I cant MM are easy ones.

thing, only, Love the music as well as the gameplay functionality. The only thing is the loading times can feel like an eternity when you just want to play songs and sometimes when you don't read the story for a hot sec, you can get into some deep water. But the story is super in depth and the mechanics are easy to grasp, but has a high skill cap. This deserves my top pick for a mobile game!

game, good, This is a good game, but, bad business practice. I played the game and it was actually fun. I do enjoy most of the characters, but, just personally don't vibe with some. Thats said, it has a terrible way of monetizing. Plagued with character paywalls to tempt you to unlock more songs rather than grinding level locks to do just that on free characters. No preview of songs attached to each character to give you a more informed decision. The high ~$14 price on each character doesn't help.

game, Amazing, Amazing music game with a good story. Kind of a money grab tho. Very addictive and worth the money you want to spend on the game. Kinda got bored of how the story is told tho. (I don't read it any more just click on it for the new music) definitely a long and difficult learning curve but once you get it it's still challenging. Been playing this game for almost a year now.

work, good, One of the best Rhytm Game that exist in the playstore and android version,, keep up the good work dev
gameplay, great, It's basically an eye candy mixed with some great music and thrilling gameplay. Not to mention the intriguing storyline, it keeps you craving for more. The only drawback which comes to mind is that the beat map of some songs could use a little bit of working on. However it's still 5 star worthy for the gameplay and visuals alone.

game, Cool, Cool game! Everything is fine inside it for me. The song... My favourite is Devilic Sphere in Robo Head. Because this song is very fast and fantastic... I love it because I like the challenging game. Same with the character... The most I want is Conner, Xenon, Kaf, Nora, Neko and Aroma. But sadly, the problem is, all of those characters need to be pay. But everything is great, the game and more thing, just all I want is try to fix that problem that's all.

money, Wasted, What happened? I lost all my progress by the time I had reinstalled the game. I had grinded those levels for days and now my data is gone? Wasted money for the character pack and some song packs but those are remained while the data progress is gone. WTH and I honestly thought I was a BUG.
game, Best, Best game ever
game, Amazing, Amazing game but there's a bug with google play pass when you get the 48h sale popup you can't get out of it. I had to wait 48 hours to be able to play the game again but the things that should be free weren't free anymore.

(eg. Cherry ~ Neko; Conner ~ Xenon) - Steep prices for song packs and characters.
version, full, *-* when will be the full version free to download? . I really love this game but ;-; it's expensive.....

games, harder, This is the rythym game that got me into harder rythym games. So I thank you for that Cytus II. You have earned a positive review, awakening me from my laziness to give accommodations to a deserving game. Thanks for the experience

option, restore, Game ia good. But the IAP bug is horrendous. Don't purchase anything as there is no restore IAP option. If you change your phone, you lose your purchases.

game, great, I mean this cytus is kinda of a great game but what happens if i don't kill Vanessa? It would be a bad ending you know Ivy died because of the Nates team i hate them :-P and Vanessa went mad i get a background called "together forever" . That is pretty sad of this story and thanks to cytus II for being a good creator of this game :) . And anyway there's an update of cytus II and im so excited ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ wooohoo

game, favourite, This is my favourite rhythm game and also i'm a fan at Rayark too...
amount, absurd, the gameplay is amazing all around, i love it so much, but the song selection is greatly limited by the absurd amount of microtransactions. in order to get the extra 14 characters, you need to pay a whopping $142USD for them; not to mention the extra song packs, where if you buy them as discounted as can be are around $90 altogether. absolutely horrendous.

progress, much, Hey guys, I redownloaded the game after a while. I had so much progress already in the storyline, but suddenly, even though I sync my Google Play to my game, my progress isn't loading in like it usually does. Did my data get wiped? Pls fix this thank you.

save, Cloud, Cloud save does not work at all. Yeah, my internet connection is offline.. that's how I could write this review.
Man, total, The calibration fixing thing need to make it easier But sir,when I'm update the game.... It is said this take 122 MB but what happened next? It take 2,5GB like you're redownload it And next is it add your memory another 2.5 GB TOO? That's make the game is 5.55 GB in total Man I'm really like the game but.... My memory capacity is more important
text, Chinese, My device are not support anymore Am can play when game on 2.1-2.3 but now when i enter am alway see Chinese text and blackscreen ...

game, great, I think that cytus 2 is overall a great game. I'd give this game 4 stars, but two big drawbacks hold it back. First, grinding for the story. It's still an annoying mechanic where you have to play songs to advance the story. I wish it was possible to skip the grinding and enjoy the story. Second, calibration. The way rayark has been doing calibration is outdated when games like Arcaea and ADOFAI can detect the calibration with just a few taps. Also, they can go beyond cytus' 0.5 maximum.

game, Great, Great and fun game! It's similar to osu! Edit: If you face an issue with save not loading after update, make sure you have cloud saving enabled under settings every time you start the game so it can sync your progress, then you can safely clear data or play on a diferent device as long as you're signed in with the same google play account. But if you never had cloud saving enabled and have already updated your game, downgrade it to a version that was working then turn on cloud saving.

game, amazing, Absolutely love the game, amazing game play that can be both challenging yet simple. Oh and the music is amazing!
months, few, My game data wiped out?! What happened? I just installed the game after few months then all my data is gone?! Even my Google Play achievements, they're gone! You better fix your cloud save system. Luckily I didn't spend a real money to the game. Please fix and improve the cloud save function of the game.

way, half, I think im only like half way but i really really really am adicted to this game and i just wanted to say to the creaters and staff that their game is really good :)
bug, major, The game is fun but has a major bug. Cloud saving is not very effective. I bought many characters and songs, got a new tablet and was hoping to play. None of my stuff got transferred to the new device... be careful if you decide to upgrade your tech. You will lose everything

holes, huge, Disclaimer : im going to talk about the story , i dont have all the charcters,The writers sacrificed world building for characters so its probabaly best not to think about the huge plot holes that they ignored like (spoiler) why do your military vans have ac that can recirculate if there is a virus out there?????.a lot of dialog feel on the nose due to translations i suggest having it interperted less literaly and more metaphoricaly.

characters, original, I love everything about this Rhythm game! It would be better to make at least half of original characters for free and other half as DLC including Miku and AI-chan! But I'm not disappointed in this, it's really great how u gave us a limited time to install it for free! This Rhythm game is really great!

game, Best, Best game ever! Love it! Play it since 2014. I would just wish for a playlist function since there are now so many chapters (you could add it under the main Menu star thingie) and a statistic function, to see when you had a new score, and the best TP and how often you played the song. That would be nice. And one day a multiplayer function but we can do that in cytus 3

povs, different, Absolutely love the game play and challenge. The story is fantastic, being told by different povs that all eventually intertwine for a beautiful finale. Each person has their own type of music so you don't have to worry about Cytus 2 not having a type of genre you want to hear. 100% would recommend anyone to play this if you like music game challenges

game, best, Cytus II is not only the best mobile game I've ever played, but it's the best rhythm game I've ever played, period. I don't say that lightly as someone who's played everything from DDR to Taiko. The story is extremely fleshed out, the characters are all great, the presentation is clean, and the music is some of the best rhythm games have to offer.

update, recent, For recent update, when i tap into the game, it will display to use headphone page at first, after that, it directly quit the game every time i try. After delete and reinstall again, problem still exist and remain the same. I also found all of these problems are more related to huawei smartphone. So, please fix it asap. I'm eager to try your latest update, don't dissapoint your supporters.

game, actual, I haven't played the actual game yet, (still finishing up some songs on hard mode in the first one) but the notification icon looks cool! All the other icons are this one shade of grey, while this one is actually colored in! It really stands out and I, for one, LOVE IT!

update, last, Since the last update, it became unplayable on my device. It always crashes before I even pick a song. I hope that it's just a bug and will be fixed next patch. Edit- It's fixed now. Thanks Rayark

screen, black, Doesn't launch on android 11, just black screen and force stops on my pixel, works fine on android 10 miui....why???
save, sure, Issue has resolved itself, it seems. Frustrating that that can happen though, so make sure cloud save is enabled. It attaches any content purchases directly to your account.
game, Nice, Nice game overall. Only problem I have is having to pay for most of it.
gameplay, amazing, amazing gameplay, and amazing storytelling. i just wish the song packs were a little more affordable. good job !

market, android, I thought I would never breakdown and actually purchase something from the android market. The first cytus changed that the second has not left me disappointed. I love it.

connection, strong, So i purchased it but wasnt able to download it. I have strong wifi connection and whats wrong with you
problem, new, I feel like there's a new problem with every update since 4.0. Currently I can't get through a song without it getting jittery and registering things as a miss. Personally I wouldn't mind if in the new update they focus solely on bug fixes and optimization instead of adding a bunch of new songs.

device, anew, Played this game in ios a while back but have since got anew Android device. Great game but what I don't understand is why it costs 2 dollars here but it's free on ios. Here's hoping my data transfers over🤞

game, first, Where do I even begin. No matter what I say, I can't start to describe how amazing and incredible this game is. The way it integrates gameplay mechanics with the story and the world of the game is beyond insane. And it pulls off the landing perfectly, while doing 20 flips midair. This is the first rhythm game I play where I'm more invested in the story, mysteries, and characters than the rhythm game aspect, which is nuts considering how much I love rhythm games. Just play the game.
game, best, Cytus 2 One of the best game I ever played Please don't give up this game and keep up the good work!

I was excited to read the story again but it was swapped . You ruined the fun . Its not fair... Come on game creator. On the next update plssss bring back the old cytus 2 main story back...

game, best, One of the best Rhythm game I've ever played
gameplay, Best, Best gameplay and more improved than Cytus 1. Songs are amazing Please add some songs from Cytus 1 like Retrospective and Sanctity to Cyrus II for Connor. It will be a pleasure to listen as well play these songs I just told. Can the Dev's add more story content to main characters? Please? This game needs more DLCs. It will be great to have a Cytus Universe

review, bad, I mostly play cytus offline because of internet connection in my house is really bad,but after the update i cant even play the game offline anymore,i wasn't going to write a bad review about it at first but my internet is really bad and everytime i open the game i can't even play it without getting a notification about my connection and i just really like cytus and still Saving for buying all of the dlc,maybe you can add a options to choose between playing online and offline.
player, avid, I was an avid player but then they started selling DLCs to enable loot boxes, nope, I'm not touching this game again
time, last, Please fix your game... I purchased Kizuna Ai last time then now I can play her songs

one, new, I uses to play this and when I changed my phone, I could not download it to my new one cause it now is a paid game. It used to be free and there were other characters you needed to pay to play, and I can not even play anymore, why would you change that.

endings, different, Came for the rhythm, hooked up with the storyline. It has RPG vibes with its different endings. The game's atmosphere also changes along the story!Story-wise,I find them cool. However, Im giving 4 stars because this game only relies on cloud save to save progress.I get that its not an online game, but I wish it saves progress within google account. I forgot to save my progress with cloud storage leading me losing my progress.Now I have to restart all over from lvl1 again, ugh.I was at lvl54.

launch, first, The game stopped working for me and it gives me an error that says that im offline even though im connected to the internet, i tried to fix it but theres nothing i can do except redownloading the app, at first launch it works as usual, but the second time i launch the app it gives me a "AUTHENTICATION=1" error, please fix the overall game performance for phones in android 10.

game, phenomenal, The game's great, the sounds are too. I don't know what I'm doing wrong - but my songs don't seem to save? All my progress wiped? It's frustrating. I've gotten the compensation and the post that it was fixed and I happily went back on to play again since it really is a phenomenal game. I've updated, but it still doesn't seem to save? Help?
music, best, Still he best music Rhythm game ever!!! They've fixed most of the crashes and I'm back to being ranked in the top 3 most of the time! Love it!
thing, only, It was nice that I got a deal on it for free! :D I enjoy it so much, and will never uninstall!! The only thing that I kinda wish you could do it get more of the story to some of them... :(

u, best, This game's definitely one of the best rythm oriented gameplay u can get in the store. Other than that, well this game is for rich players. U like the song buy it. If not, stick with the free characters. Not gonna blame em cos the DJs seem to be payed as I came across YouTube channel of some of them commenting about their song on Cytus. Don't have any prove tho. I'm f2p btw L0L!

people, Many, I lost my game data. Many people are loosing too. Fix it plz...
optimisation, awful, You thought that the awful optimisation is bad enough but guess what; THE RECENT (ver 4.2) UPDATE WIPES YOUR ENTIRE PROGRESS CLEAN!!! and I absolutely despise grinding in this game just to proceed story-wise or just obtaining tracks in general because of how convoluted it can be. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR PROGRESS!!

stuff, new, Focusing too much on adding new stuff instead of fixing the actual gameplay performance problems. Game has always been horribly optimized but WAS still playable, but last update changed that. There is a consistent constant stuttering EVERY 3 SECONDS in-game which turns random notes into misses, basically making it unplayable now. UPDATE: 6 updates and nearing half-a-year later, still happening. If it helps, I'm on Android 10.

lags, Constant, As much as I love this game, please optimize the game. Constant lags, menu loading time takes too long, my device easily heats up, occasional crashes, songs sometimes glitching out.

Please do better and have a dedicated update just for bug fixes

game, made, Unquestionably one of the most well made and polished game on smartphones. The songs and pieces that can be played are mostly made by talented artists or composers and the story and gameplay is incredible, especially for free. There are some In App purchases but they're only for extra content and to help Rayark continue and develop as a company.

game, cool, Besides being a very cool rhythm game, Cytus II has a wonderful and immersive storyline, which I enjoyed fully. The writing is elegant, every character feels alive. The music is also diverse too, which a bunch of different genres to chose from. My only complains are the paywalls and DLCs that lock you out of content you will enjoy, but other than that, the whole game and story can be played without any other purchases besides the initial one. Overall, it's a fun game to play, and a nice story.

story, nice, Besides being a very cool rhythm game, Cytus II has a wonderful and immersive storyline, which I enjoyed fully. The writing is elegant, every character feels alive. The music is also diverse too, which a bunch of different genres to chose from.

version, newest, I like this game, very much. but it keeps stopping after i played for 2 days. I've done everything but it keeps stopping and it's bothering me. i already reinstall it to the newest version and always cleaning my storage until 25 gb (capacity 32 gb) but it keeps stopping. can you fix this? thank you :)
game, Good, Good game but it kinda sucks that we need to play online not like the previous version

ways, worst, I've played Cytus since 2017. The premise of the game itself is genius and no rhythm game can ever replicate how fun it can be. Unfortunately, a lot of the charts in this are either painfully boring or super overcharted in the worst ways possible, and its only been getting worse since version 3.7. Wish Rayark would get some new blood in the charters, cause the leading few have all gone stale.

game, crazy, Very crazy and cool rhythm game. The best advice I can give is that you have 2 thumbs. Use both of them.

things, unlockable, why is it that paff has 2 unlockable things that clearly state "get 300 combo on song *x* on ANY DIFFICULTY" but if you try it on easy you'll find that it is literally impossible. example: fireflies (funk fiction remix), which is one of the two, on easy full combo is 174...but ANY DIFFICULTY...ANY? really? you sure?

game, great, It's an extremely great game that I play over and over. The one problem is, I have to play over and over. It's not really storage efficient for updates and fills a phone quickly. Otherwise it's an amazing game. Edit: Turn on cloud save in-game . . .

music, great, At first it was pretty confusing but after some time I get the hang of it. It has great music. My favourite is restriction by robohead. It has nice storyline. The story uncovers itself as you play the game. Very nice 12/10 would recommend to friend

mode, offline, OK .Need offline mode :v
game, Great, Great game, but the cost of everything is too high. Pay for the game, pay for the songs, pay for side story + song packs, and other systems made to get you to spend even more. One or two of these are fine, but this many is too much. I love cytus, but I don't want to spend so much to play.

game, good, Damn Pricey... But a good game nonetheless
update, recent, Since the most recent update, I've had to reinstall the game 5 times due to repeared issues. The game can hang when either trying to sync or download a song. The only way I've found this is to force stop it, which seems to have a decent chance of breaking the game requiring a reinstall. If it weren't for that issue I'd give the game 5 stars. The gameplay is fun and the pricing for additional content I feel is very reasonable.

game, best, By far the best rhythm game on Android, period. Quite possibly in the running among top rhythm games ever. The story is weird and wonderful and the way you engage with the game is unique. There's hardly ever a time I don't enjoy with Cytus.

game, Good, The pricing is reasonable. Even though theres more in app purchases id say itd be no problem. As long as theres no bugs and stuff. Good game. Would recommend.

He is my favorite (also Joe!) and I keep playing his music 😊 I know he is not the main characters but hopefully (someday) you might consider to add more of his music 😁 update 29/9/21: please make this available to be played offline again T^T

game, phenomenal, Ight so I started playing this game years ago, and finally started to pick up it again recently... All I have to say is damn. What a phenomenal game. Obviously it has it's flaws but it really does bring the payoff. From the music to the story, just an all around enjoyable experience- especially if you have the patience and time like me to complete it all. I am blown away by this game, after all, it came completely out of left field. This game truly left an impression on me. Well done Rayark.

version~, full, Got for free. Can't play need to buy the full version~ what a waste~
lot, whole, I appreciate the game a whole lot, in fact I consider it one of the best game on the store if I don't take into account the pricing. The main issue is that even after buying the game you have to pay more if you want content outside the "free" one you paid. The price tags for packs are just screaming cash grab. You get around 10 songs per character (basically a musical theme) and each character cost ~11€, there are like 15 characters to buy, there is also (30) song packs costing 5.5€ for 5 songs.

issue, big, The story of this Game is great, honestly some stuff is just shockingly good. Now, the big issue is... Yes the paywalls. This game offers a lot of free content, but to get the full experience and parts of the story (from what I can tell) you have to go through paywalls. Onto Carachter and design and graphics, I love Neko she's adourable, Zeno is also a very interesting character, and Paff Has in my opinion the best song collection. The audio quality is great, the intro is amazing Over All 8/10

price, asking, I love it. Always wanted to get the game but I'm not able to buy it, however once I saw it was on sale I downloaded and didn't regret it at all whatsoever. 11/10 game, I 100% recommend and is worth the asking price
game, excellent, I didn't even know if I liked rhythm games before I played this. That should say how good this game is. Apart from being an excellent rhythm game, it also has a pretty good story. Overall, it's a really great game.

change, recent, As usual, the game is great and fun to play, but i have a problem with RayArk's recent change in selling games to customers. Put a full price on your game and its content. Why do i have to pay price for a game, to find out that the game and all of its content is literally chopped in half by microtransactions? I understand that some of the composers demand money from you using their songs in your game, but the whole thing feels like one of the typical Chinese money grabbing games.

game, great, This is a great rhythm game to play on a tablet. The songs aren't my favorite genre but they're good and well-integrated with the controls. Lots of free content and though there's even more paid content, I haven't felt the urge to buy anything yet. Which is good, because the stuff is expensive! The game has a story that sparks curiosity and the way in which you uncover the lore is fun and engaging. I signed up for just a rhythm game, and was pleasantly surprised by the worldbuilding.

game, best, Absolutely the best rhythm game on mobile so far
fun, more, I love the game. It helps me not get bored whenever I'm out and makes the day more fun. But srsly, pls remove the cannot connect net authentication failed message. It keeps spamming it. I purchased the game because its great to play offline. Remove this message that keeps spamming when it can't connect to the net. This same problem is also in Cytus 1. Fix this spam message in both the games and remove it. I don't want to see it. If we face problems, we can contact, no need to spam. Remove pls!!!

games, favourite, Was going to give this game a 5-stars, but since Offline mode removed from the system, i can't give 5-stars. Even if Cytus 2 is one of my favourite games, and it's still is. Please return Offline mode.🙏

complaint, cool, Pretty cool only complaint is I don't like easy mode cause it's slow and boring and hard to chaos is sometimes to slow for me or is impossibly fast not in reaction speed but what you atcually have to do to requires and extra second which makes the game more difficult but I wish you had a I between I love going fast but doing the extra movements that requires an extra second really slow me down

updates, recent, The game become so laggy after the recent updates and i can't play it offline anymore that pissed me off
game, Awesome, Awesome game and the devs are really helpful with issues. Edit: What happened? Why can't I play offline anymore? :c
game, good, It's a very good game give it a week try Vibe check
game, Great, Great game
game, great, It's a great game but there's 2 problems I never had until now. First, we can't play offline anymore? I really liked the fact that I can play it wherever whenever and now I can't. Secondly, I turned on Cloud Save because I didn't want my progress to be lost and now every time I sync, it just stays on syncing and I don't know why. I have to actually go to the start screen again to get rid of that but it happens to every song I do nowadays...please consider fixing those it's really fun
game, best, The best rhythm game I've ever played but ever since 4.0 update I've encountered longer loading and crashing on the opening scene. Please fix i wanna play again

graphics, nice, Very very very nice graphics. However, absolutely no explanation on how to use this game. So for that, I have to un-install it still confused.
game, Thai, Thai game was actually amazing if you didn't have to gamble to get the glitch versions of songs it would be even better. But some of the songs are amazing and the character have some awesome backstory. Also great job at making nekosaikou such a hatable unimportant character.

plss, Offline, Offline mode plss
characters, many, One word. AWESOMEE !! I didn't think I'd like the circle tap style as I was used to the tile one, but man this is something else !! The Chaos levels are the best !! The character designs, way of revealing the story through posts and chats, the UI, the graphics and the music ofc, all are top notch. Still early on in the story, wanna see what happens yayy! Also there are many later characters too (most of em i cant afford :') cuz im broke). Try it out !!

tutorial, called, Omg. 5 min and I'm still reading instructions and can't start yet. The so called tutorial is so slow and boring. This game is gone.
elements, digital, Love all the Games made by you. The Essence of the music the rhythm, that touches your soul and make you emotional and energetic. The music is so great that I had to listen it again and again also not the least the story impressive all the digital elements. Can you just add voice-over for the message or the narrative in all characters voice that would be amazing love to see that in future. Regards for your future games.

time, long, Rayark is rhythm. Since coming along a long time ago with Cytus, they have never stopped dominating the mobile rhythm game market. Cytus II is amazing. They have outdone themselves and even using a social media feed to tell the story. Utter genius.

features, offline, Edit: Thanks for bringing back the offline features of this game!
game, favorite, Was my favorite game, it still is btw. It's just I grinded this game for a very long period of time and sadly was forced to Uninstall after awhile I decided to install again and all of my progress was gone even though I remember saving my progress. Secondly i believe they removed the feature to play offline which made me very sad. But other than that, it's a very wonderful game with beautiful visuals and addictive gameplay that you can spend 100+ hours without getting bored or tired.

game, good, Worth your $1.99. This game's pretty good. The story on this game is just decent. The maps are very well made, chaos maps are balanced to the point where they are just perfect to test your skills and the easy/hard ones are also made to be just challenging enough to improve your skills. I give a 9/10.

icons, popular, For people like me that doesnt have money to afford, atleast make some of those popular icons like kaf and Kizuna Ai playable even just half of their songs and the rest is unlockable through purchase cuz literally its a rip-off, even though its for supporting the devs, anyway 2 stars still, besides that gameplay is absolutely fine but the IAP dragged it down. syncing data on cloud and not google is not a good move cuz before it was working but now it reset my progress jeez

game, Super, Super fun rhythm game! The levels are balanced and there is a ton of replayability with the level system! My only criticisms falls on the character level lock system and the limited songs of a certain punk album which will not be named... just wish there was more than 3 songs available at the start...

game, awesome, Is really bad that every time you update the game we have to download again all the 1.5GB of it, espite of saying is just and update of 260mb. Apart from that, is an awesome game.
game, Good, Good game. Unfortunately the monetisation is pretty bad. The game requires an Internet connection now too, which it didn't used to :/
move, Bad, Bad move Rayark. You just lost a lot of players here in my country due to the internet requirement update. I have been playing this game for a very long time. One of the reasons I like this game was that the game can be played offline and so I can play during my travels.

prices, reasonable, The game is amazing. But the fact that there's over $300 of in app purchases and a third of it is characters and story content is laughable. I have no problem supporting developers further a game I love but locking lore behind a credit card is ridiculous and not even for reasonable prices either smh

game, favorite, Used to be my favorite game, but the removal of offline play is a deal breaker for me. Not sure what Rayark was thinking with that. Game data cannot be transferred between operating systems, and the leaderboard system is a joke. With that said, in terms of gameplay this is the best rhythm game out there. Great songs, handles smoothly, and a nice range of difficulty. Great story as well. I really want to give this game 5 stars and keep buying DLC, but there's just too many deal breakers.
play, offline, Used to be my favorite game, but the removal of offline play is a deal breaker for me. Not sure what Rayark was thinking with that.

games, fun, One of the most fun rhythm games I've played. There's no ads, no lives so your gameplay is never interrupted. The songs are really good, and the story mode is interesting. Love the gameplay, though it can be frustrating as it's very easy to miss notes when your fingers are in the way. Definitely worth a try

requirement, Constant, Constant Internet connection requirement is a complete bs. Don't treat the game like it's some kind of MOBA. People play this because it's the best one out of the rythm games out there and the internet authentication process happens once in awhile.

space, enough, Can't download it. I have more than enough space. I have a good connection. Deemo DLS just fine...it's something on your end. I've payed a lot for this game and I'm really angry that I can't play it I have a android Motorola. Edit: This issue is still not fixed when it was 2020 when it was brought to your attention rayark. Your rates dropped from 5 to 2 then 1 stars...I have 4gs available on my phone...there is no excuse. And now the support staff is dead

version, latest, This used to not be a problem, but I can no longer play this game offline even when I am on the latest version. It it a huge inconvenience that I have to authenticate every time I open the app.

games, favourite, After finishing the game, I think I can confidently say that this game has become one of my all time most favourite games, the unique style of rhythm game is fun and given the right charts can be incredibly varied, any DLC is completely worth it, and the story, world and characters are absolutely phenomenal, I absolutely couldn't recommend it more, it is incredibly saddening to me that the story is over, unless Rayark has something planned. Farewell, Cytus II, I will forever wait for III.

authentication, online, So now the game needs an online authentication now, why? This is supposed to be my on the go offline game and now you're bringing this in for what reason? You're making a good go bad for this reason. I downloaded it for one reason. Its a fun offline game that works amazingly on my phone and I love it for that reason. Nothing comes close to Cytus 2. But please fix this major issue

design, Simpler, Simpler yet cooler design, a fresh take on storytelling yet still stunning (if not even better) as the first game. And of course, the song selection is just spot on. Update: Just heard that you must have internet on to play this game. Not a chance I will even update it. In fact I've deleted it. I will wait until whether they decide to walk back on that or not. If they do, I will happily come back. If they don't, farewell.

update, newest, Edit - 5 stars down to 3 stars Game itself is still great, but the fact that the newest update made internet connection mandatory is a straight downgrade and very inconvenient. This sort of move should not be support. I will return this to a comprehensive 5 star review once they change this back.

effort, much, Really disappointing that so much effort has been lost.
update, recent, Literally unplayable for me. Spent over a hundred dollars on song packs over the years only to have the most recent update stop you from playing unless you're connected to wifi. I only have wifi at home, and I don't play this game at home. Feels like I've been robbed. This should be illegal.
graphics, sheer, As much as I'd like to give this 5 stars for the sheer graphics, I simply can't for the fact I bought and installed but can't get past the intro without a security error hence force closing the app and not letting me play.
game, absolute, This was my absolute favorite mobile game pretty much ever, particularly because I could play it offline during commutes or flights. I just tried to play it on a plane for the first time in a couple years and it now requires connection for auth? What?????? Please go back to being able to play offline. I've dropped so much money buying every song pack and character, I don't want to use data or pay for flight wifi to play.

update, new, When the new update came I lost all my data for the game but I'm willing to play it all over again. The real problem is I have the play pass, so I should get free characters without having to pay again, but that is not the case. Every time when I'm finished with one song, there's this pop up that I have to pay 1 cent for new characters and every time when I press the pop up, it doesn't register and I have to restart the entire game again. Plz fix this because honestly it's getting me pissed.

player, single, Without warning the game has changed to online only for absolutely no reason. Then, their servers are down right now, so I can't play a single-player game I paid a lot of money for because their servers are down, which is something that makes absolutely no sense to happen to a single-player game that doesn't have any reason to be online outside of syncing and purchases. Also suddenly changing to online-only with no warning after I'd spent a lot of money is a terrible business practice.

amount, positive, better than Cytus(1) at least. Still, the overwhelmingly positive amount of reviews confuses me.
version, pirated, It's extremely frustrating that all the data is wiped. I played some songs just for the sake of the storyline and I need to replay them again. Can't even get myself to open the app and restart all progress. Should have just downloaded the pirated version.
update, new, After the new update, the game is so much smaller on my screen! Its already hard enough as it is and now everything is smaller. Smh
game, Best, Best rhythm game in mobile. 🔥 Though, I want to be able to just play the game even without internet connection. I dont need cloud save.
storage, whole, I still love this game and it's music! Neko#oωo for life lol :p It's kinda hard to get really really good with thumbs but it's possible. Make sure you turn on cloud save before getting this update :3 Speaking of.. I don't really understand why the update is so huge :c I know it's done this in the past but I'm worried it might wipe my whole phone storage and I had like 5 GB available before even getting it. Update stays at 100% when it's still updating
games, favorite, Used to be one of my favorite OFFLINE games, played it when ever I went on a trip since connection was unstable along the way, now we'll, kinda pointless since no longer offline.
game, Amazing, Amazing game, played the first one for HOURS so I knew I had to get this one. At first getting used to the new note types was kind of awkward, but I soon grew to like them. The "swipe" notes are still a little iffy sometimes in my experience, however. I posted my original reciew on the 4th of September 2019, now almost 2 years later I'm still playing this game. It's still just as fun. I've racked up days of playtime but it never gets boring.

game, Best, Best rhythm game I've ever played! The story is amazing and the IM feels like the real world equivalent. Edit: The recent 4.2 update has caused data loss issues for android 11 users that didn't use cloud saving. If you are just now updating please save your progress before updating. Also Rayark, the 4.2 update doesn't fully fit the screen of a A20 Samsung. Please add a screen aspect ratio option to allow users to fix this locally. Thanks!

issue, lost, Thanks for fixing the lost progress issue, but my latest progress from capso! still lost. I am sure turning on my cloud save before 4.2 update, but it still lost...

combo, full, I'm so done with this game! It keeps glitching every time the song speeds up so thanks to that I miss the notes and I can't have the full combo.
😍, ending, I love the ending 😍
game, best, Still to this day, Rayark Inc with Cytus holds the crown for the best rhythm game available in the platform. No one does it like Cytus. But, it's been awhile and it seems that the devs are not responding correctly. So please hear us the fans : BRING BACK THE OFFLINE AVAILABILITY! it is such as ridiculous thing to BUY the game and still not capable to play it offline. You guys did it on Cytus I but took it away as well after some time. Just why??

update, Last, Last update fixed the loading time issue, Now the game feels more smoother than before. Thank you.
screen, black, I can't open this game after 4.2 update. If I open it it only shows a black screen
songs, Nice, Nice songs, chaos difficulty is ridiculous
one, second, Gameplay and music from the original Cyrus is superior to this. Something about this second one is just off-putting and overwhelming. The story and the on and off reading of comments in each chapter or character is messy and feels unnecessary, tedious even. A rather let down in comparison to the glorious original.

update, recent, Because of the recent update I lost all of my progress... Years of playing this game for nothing... I am very disappointed.
❤, favourite, This game is my favourite ❤️but something missing like no player ranking.I hope this game add player ranking to challenge in the world
connection, persistent, 2 star for now, it now needs persistent internet connection in-game,authentication always pops out when not connected to the internet,make it offline again while playing a chart.
ride, good, well, i got some experience it in, also lost an account on it, quite a good ride and perfect time to restart

headphones, good, This game feels amazing and I've enjoyed it quite a lot. Really nice to wind down, plug in my good headphones, and just vibe with the music
depth, more, Quality Rhythm game. If you like to try something new and get into Rhythm, this is the spot. Let it be known this is also a story base rhythm game, which adds more depth to playing, but most people might not like this feature if all they want was straight game play. Contains DLC at a price that I think is worth for the effort put into this game. Rayark tends to put their money into developing more content for their games. This is a Unique experience and immersive rhythm game unlike others.

save, Cloud, Cloud save is useless. It did not even save my game progress like score and data.
progress, save, I've never enjoyed saying 'I was so close' until I played this game Edit: The 4.2 data made me lose all my save progress, so I lost hours of progress as a result. Not really ideal....
wut, Online, Online wut? And so lag
times, many, no matter how many times I have downloaded this game but it never can be installed in my phone but anyway great game if you can install it

update, recent, Used to love this game, but the recent update restarted my entire game even though cloud save was turned on. Seems like there's a lot of glitches for android going unnoticed by the Rayark team lately.

state, early, I love this game. I really do... but why does Rayark have to reset the progress after every update? I've lost my progress at least thrice now from before cloud save and after too cause I had a very early state saved. Just please Rayark I don't want to have to redo the entire storyline multiple times because of updates. (This review was written right after the 4.1.0 update) Ps with the new update the game no longer fills the screen of my S20 Ultra and I feel like it makes the game look worse

update, last, I'm not gonna remove my 5 stars because the game is really great, but all of my progress was deleted I think after the last update...haven't had problems in all these years so hopefully it'll get fixed soon.
issue, only, Superfun game with no ads. The only issue is whenever it updates it deletes all my data wich is very anoying.
cutscene, 1st, Recently the game bugged and restart story progress all the way back to the 1st cutscene when the cloud save was all the way at the end of the game, Lucky that I had a cloud save, but for someone who didn't have a cloud save would be screwed by the recent update that reset the story progress to the start.

release, early, What can I say???! It's freakin' perfect!! The music, the charts, the emotions, the story, everything is perfect, been playing this since it's early release of the game and still addicted to it till now. The best music game ever!! Your money won't go to waste by giving the team a little support 😉

updates, recent, As a rhythm game, it is pretty great-- one of my favorited even. However, the cloud save does not seem to be functioning well since the recent updates. Even when using the same device, I lose the character levels, songs, and scores and only retain the ones I had before the recent updates.

rhythms, complex, This game is just amazing! I love the design and graphics as it looks very cool to play and the songs are also very good with complex rhythms. Everything is good except the paywall for the story and characters...
game, new, My game resetted after the update for some reason. Please solve the problem asap! My characters lvl all went back down to lvl 0 basically like starting a new game. I wouldnt want to continue if i need to replay everything
update, recent, The game is really fun but the most recent update has been crashing the game for me and a lot of other people. After a month this still hasn't been resolved. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.

games, favorite, This is one of my all time favorite rhythm games and it's my intention to get 100TP on easy and hard charts. My review is rated as such because recently, I've been trying to save my progress on Cloud. When I attempt to save to cloud from the settings, the app either freezes or crashes. As a loyal fan of Cytus 2, I plea to have this problem/bug fixed. Thanks in advance!

game, good, I cant play the game, its crashing after a minute in. Bugs aside, it's a really good rythum game. Story is amazing but the problem is that its told in a complex way. Before, there were less characters to follow, less logs to read after each level up. Now theres 22 characters and leveling up is easier but it so much to read. It overwhelming, a easy solution is to hide a couple characters like Ivy, Crystal Punk, Vanessa, until the other characters have reached a specific level, then reveal them.

songs, nice, Game is good and fun, nice songs too its just that you need to pay again to enjoy all the games' content
characters, free, Not my style, but works fine. Just one thing, I'd like there to be more free characters and a clearer interface. At first, I was kind of lost. I didn't know where to go and what was what. Please do something about that.

The best rhythm game ever🤩🤩

seconds, few, Please help! I've been trying to play the game but every time I open it, it hangs a few seconds into the intro of the animation, just before the drums kick in. At some point after reinstalling it, I was able to get through but only after managing to hit skip. I tried replaying the animation in the archive but it hangs in the same spot. Now, the animation doesn't play at all.. So far, the rest of the game works fine. It's only that intro.. please have this fixed, thank you!

difficulties, harder, Been a lot of stuttering that didn't used to exist. Really need to get this fixed because the game is unplayable in this state, especially on harder difficulties.
fun, much, So much fun!
mistake, best, Accidentally bought it. Was the best mistake I've ever made The music, the effects, the story, the vocals, oh my god this game is incredible. Would heavily reccomend for anyone who likes rythm games and music in general
story, Beautiful, Cytus 2 is much better than cytus. Beautiful story with next level music. Oh Man, Download it now
level, next, Cytus 2 is much better than cytus. Beautiful story with next level music. Oh Man, Download it now
characters, other, I really love the game! Worth paying for, I'm so glad I download the game, the storyline is so awesome, you can feel sadness, happiness and hates in the game, I really love the songs, most of them are my type of songs but the others aren't not my type but still I play them coz they sound good at the end. I finished the game and I have to say that the story is deep and awesome, and sad. Too bad that the other characters are needed to be paid to be played but I love the game!
others, many, Its been crashing after roughly 2 minutes into using the app. It seems like im not the only one as well. Theres also a stutter issue when playing a song that can be a little rough. Love the game, always have. However these 2 issues are keeping me from playing. Please fix it when you can. I and many others miss the game greatly.
game, Great, Great game, really fun, but a lot of content is locked behind an insanely high pay wall, and after already paying for a game, im fine with a game having powerups you can buy with money, but having content locked behind a pay wall im not okay with, it's probably one of the best mobile rhythm games though, so im stuck with it

update, recent, I really love cytus 2, but my game doesn't want to open any more after recent update :/. I still think it's a 5 star in my opinion though.
game, solid, A very solid rhythm game with an intriguing story and generous difficulty curve. Lots of paid $10 DLC packs available, but a lot of unlockable free content as well. Excellent performance and praiseworthy stylistic UI flair culminate in a game that is easily worth the price of admission.

game, Good, Good game but absurdly overpriced music packs Really liked this game when I got into it that was until I got bored of the default music pack and decided to try other songs, and oh boy was I surprised, the pricing is so bad that it almost made me leave the game, for example for the cost of 4-5 packs you could get all the music packs + upcoming packs in muse dash with a free xp boost, now I'm not saying that this is a bad game, however they could've charged the game more instead of the DLC

game, great, great game. Its just like osu but in mobile. the beats are sync to my touch (this may vary through devices). the songs are abundances (free and paid) and they're all fantastic songs. although, the in-app purchase songs are kinda expensive lol.

game, Cool, Cool game, just gotta wonder why characters over Giraff.J gotta be paid access and why the entire Capso System has to first be paid for in order to use, when the game already costs money. Just curious on that.
star, Extra, (Edit: Extra star for adding DLC song bundles.) Great art, great music, great story, but the IAP is ridiculous. If your going to do this at least offer an all characters dlc bundle or season pass type thing. $120 to get the full story so far is utter nonsense especially if you want all the black market packs which raises it to $220. It's a great rhythm game and If it gets a console release with ALL the DLC I'll DEFINITELY give it a raving 5-Star review on whatever I get it on.

update, latest, The game keeps crashing since the latest update it became unplayable for me, 2 updates ago the game was working well and it doesn't crash but now it does hopefully you can fix this soon i still rate 4 stars because me and my friends had fun with this game back then
update, last, After this last update the game keeps crashing in the opening video or while loading, after I tap the screen in the "tap the screen to continue" screen.
game, best, Still the best rhythm game in android, and i already play Cytus since 2015 i never bored playing this game!
game, great, It's a great rhythm game, but too bad most of the song are paid in game
game, great, Kinda like Osu! But it's a great game and has a story line that you can ignore or play along with
hope, last, After I updated the game, it keeps crashing. I restarted my phone but it still keeps on crashing. My last hope is clearing its data, so guess what? Its still keeps crashing and my data has been erased even though it is connected to my google play account. Another data to waste to redownload this game. I'll edit my review later if I solved it or not. Edit: Its working again, but I lost my progress even though I cloud saved it. ):> Edit2: yep, its still crashing, pls. Optimize it :<
game, nice, Pretty nice game, i like this gameplay
screen, black, So in actually this game is good and great, but something that still the problem is that the game always hard to install in this device (maybe that's because of my device too) like the app says data not fully downloaded or just black screen, so I think it still need to be fixed on that.
update, new, Hi! Im so happy about the new update! But there is a BIG issue. It wont let me save the score of the song, like the data and Im scared that Il have to switch my phone or reset it and the game will be loaded to a lower level( the game reseted one time and thanks god I saved the data) I tried to play different characters and try to save the data, but the game crashes or locks my screen. Sorry for the rating, but Im really upset about this... Do you think you can solve it?

characters, other, Giving it 4 stars. This game is really good that I've bought some other characters just to play. I really hope that they add some free characters and songs. And hoping that they add some new skins for Neko and others, also hoping that they add new endings and extend the story 'coz it's really coolll!!! UPDATE!: bruhh the update takes over my phone storage. The update shows 81 mb but it feels like I downloaded a 3 Gigabyte worth of app.

game, Phenomenal, Phenomenal game. I remember waiting anxiously for it to release in my high-school homeroom, and I've been playing it since the day it came out. Beautiful artwork, story, and music. The game is completely realized and provides more than enough content to fully enjoy the game without having to make a single additional purchase; however, if you do choose to buy an expansion it's more than worth the money. Rayark knocked it out of the park with this one, a 10/10 experience.

game, Excellent, Excellent game, better than OSU. But the cloud save fonction is broken on my phone now. The game send an error message every time saying: internet connection failed. I would have given 5 star if not for that bug.

improvement, only, Loading times are now worse compared to back then. The only improvement that I like is that the story database has now a filter. Anyway, i really hope that there would be an option to lower or disable some menu transitions or graphics.
pack, miku, I really love the miku pack. I hope for more collaborations and please add cytus or deemo songs

mess, unplayable, The game has become an unplayable mess
issue, only, It Worth to play I love it.The only issue is loading screen take too long.
issue, only, I love this game a lot. The story is engaging and the gameplay is fun and challenging enough that it doesn't get boring. The only issue is that if you delete the app, your progress isn't saved with google play. I've gotten new phones and redownloaded the app, only to have to level up my characters to level eighty all over again, which takes super long every time. This game is great if you never switch phones or delete the app, but if you do either of those things, you have to start from scratch.

games, best, One of the best games Play store have, love this!
game, premium, A very premium game indeed. It's a storyline we didn't know we needed. Definitely worth the buy, great replay value, I heard. But story alone is quite long, I've been playing for almost a week and I barely made a dent in the plot.

updates, last, too laggy after the last 2 updates, now it wont open.
songs, more, If adding more songs makes the game increasingly unstable you should stop adding songs and make a new game or fix the issue.

update, recent, Changing my rating to 1 star because the recent update broke the game. Every time I try to boot it up the game instantly crashes. Never had problems with this game until now.
experience, last, Ok ok, from my last experience, a lot of the songs were paid but putting that aside, my main problem with it is how oftenly it requires us to login with internet in order to grant us access to the game. I get that it's for security reasons, but seriously. If I had internet all the time I wouldn't be looking for an offline game. It's way better with Cytus, where you need to check in only once or twice a week.

stuff, Good, Good stuff
update, new, I've always liked this game, but the new update seems to be crashing the game all the time. I've tried reinstalling it, but it didn't help. If something new in the game is making that happen, I can't even try to fix it since it crashes 3-20 seconds within opening the app. I hope this gets fixed so I can play again.
game, Perfect, Perfect music game
devices, small, It's hard to play on small screen devices
loading, Long, Damn, Rayark, you really ****ed this game up. Now the game is pisspoor in terms of performance too. Long loading times that freeze often and constant stutters during gameplay which is absolutely unacceptable in a rhythm game. These problems did not exist in my phone before the 4.0 update. Just, wow. Guess my phone doesn't meet this game's standards anymore. Cool.

space, much, I had given this game 5 stars but now I gotta change my rating. As it keeps getting updated, it now takes up too much GB space on my phone. I have had to delete apps just to be able to play and then redownload them when I'm done. I have invested $$ money in this game and I'd hate to delete it again since I'll lose all my progress, but if there are going to be more updates I'll probably have to delete this game permanently from my phone since I won't be able to play it. 😩

stories, Great, Rayark: Great stories in exchange for your emotions getting kicked in the testicles.
bit, kinda, Its been a while now, and i found the tap circle fx kinda bit pixelated and the older version is so satisfying whenever you click on it, can you make a feature where you can also put the older ver. of tapping circles as a selectable feature, i recently play more on Cytus than CytusII because of it. I think itll help a lot

section, little, Wow this game is just incredible and fun, the music is outstanding and it really bring you in the atmosphere when reading the little message section feels like another world and i didnt think it was possible for me to ever think so high of any game till i played this game, must try.
account, correct, Unfortunate. I love Cytus, and I have it on both my phone and iPad, but today, I decided to play it during work break, only to find that it started all over again. My phone is new, but I've never had this issue as long as I'm logged into the correct Google account, which I always am. I'm not raging pissed since I have my iPad, but I had my million master records on my phone, so it's... Ok, I guess I'm a little pissed.
game, Great, Great game.
characters, other, hoping to have other characters for free. 😁 really love this game
bit, little, Can you decrease the space a little bit
update, latest, Ever since the latest update, the game gets stuck in the loading screen, hope this issue gets fixed soon 🙏 Edit 29/7 : Great, forget the loading screen now I can't even start the game anymore
game, great, It seems to be a great game, but it's currently unplayable.
game, Awesome, Awesome music game, beautiful art. Two glaring problems with it though. First is the tempo line changes in certain songs sometimes too radically it almost feels like a cheap way to ramp up the difficulty and turn it into a pure reaction game. Second is the unskippable story scenes, and the enormous amount of story related messages that are mandatory to go through one by one. I still give it five stars because I feel a lot of care is being put in which is more than I can say for most mobile games

time, SECOND, Love the game, but I've had to reinstall the app to get it working again, and a SECOND time, my data just doesn't load. All progress lost. Please focus on the game data not clearing itself after an update. Otherwise great game.

time, limited, its been 2 years since this happened, i started playing cytus 2 ever since the made this game free for a limited time. in 2019, im on the third title screen and all of my characters are maxed out, even the first newly released free character, but one day, suddenly the game went weird, intro's text became chinese then crashed and it stops from there which led me no choice but to reinstall the game, not knowing that it'll remove all of my progress of less than 2 years of grinding please help...

tentacles, alien, I like the art style. More than anything else. It is pretty confusing in terms of layout and I couldn't enjoy it on my Tab S6, just bad to handle, unless you got alien tentacles instead of fingers. Also, the permissions are ridiculous! Body sensor, microphone, contacts, camera.. r u kidding me? Plus, crashed/unresponsive blackscreened on opening..
tracks, cool, I honestly enjoy the game. It's got a lot of content, a lot of cool tracks and charts, and visually is very polished. But the game NEEDS to fix it's inputs. I'm not sure if it's bad optimization or poor programming or just a bug but having tight and responsive controls should be the main focus of your rythm game, not how many songs you have. Not being able to get passed a B because the game doesn't count every note is really annoying. Wouldn't reccomend in it's current state :/.

storage, enough, This game is good! Love the story telling of this game. One solution for the lagging may be due to not having enough storage, I suggest deleting some of the unused games to clear space for cytus, this lowers the chance of lagging. The solution works for me and my sibling, however I do not know about others. I hope Cythus would fix the lagging and bugs, so that new players would have a better first impression of the game, and old players won't feel like their being cheated of their money.

drops, slow, okay since the update I experienced slow loading time frame rate drops, and I'm not the only one experiencing this issue, many people pointed it out. please fix it

update, next, The game update is really awesome but when it comes to performance, it takes really long to load each character. IM takes long to load too. I will update my rating if changes are made or it will become worse on the next update (which I hope not)
updates, Most, Most recent updates seem to have broken the game for me, unfortunately. I can only go into the app for about 15 seconds before it closes unexpectedly, not even with a error message. Hopefully something can be done soon because the updates kinda got me excited.

bit, little, It's good for me. The loading is a little bit slow but it's okay. Overall, it's satisfying.
update, recent, It keeps crashing since the most recent update. It was fine before??
times, multiple, very disappointed. the game has frozen on the home screen, multiple times, constantly lags, constantly glitches, and overall has ruined my love for the game. I even uninstalled the app and ended up clearing my data multiple times, just to have my game ruined by the same issues. 😐

untill, amazing, I've been playing this game for months now and it was amazing untill the last update, it gets stuck at loading screen and it's lagging a lot. I'll give it five star rating again after this issue is fixed. Update: Even after the latest update nothing's fixed.

crashes, more, I really love the game and the elements of it, but more and more the crashes and FPS draw is getting more bothersome, please fix it
level, whole, seriously this took rhythm games to a whole new level that gives a futuristic experience I think you should check it out #-^

game, Great, Great game but it can be costly. For all content and all character unlocks looking at round eighty to one hundred dollars. So beware.
games, best, I liked the first Cytus but it doesn't even compare to this one in how good it is. Plays like the original but actually gives you context about the world. The more you play, the more you learn and you just become immersed in it. The graphics are beautiful, the music rocks... And they did not have to go that hard on the intro but they did and I love it. 10/10 - one of the best mobile games I've played.

sailing, smooth, Really good in my opinion never really had anything bad from this game just one time I opened it and close but after that it went smooth sailing.
characters, playable, Where did all of my songs go?! I nearly maxed out the playable characters. It had been a couple montbs since I last played but I never uninstalled the game. Irritating that my progress was wiped clean.
game, Good, Good game but you guys just never fix bugs The latest update made everything laggy, the music at the opening was out of sync, it takes too long to load any character now, ruining my imersion in the story. I've seen other reviews conokaining about this as well. Please fix this.

share, fair, Quality wise, it's the creme of the crop. However, the game has its fair share of bugs and long loading screens. Also, the DLCs are extremely overpriced.

game, best, The best rhythm game i've ever play, the sound is cool

news, Good, Thank you devs! I wrote a review earlier this month complaining about the bugs and load times. Good news, theyre gone! Cytus II is back to its former glory. Very responsive, quick-paced, and challenging without it being impossible to figure out. Really the only thing bugging me is the somewhat grindy part of the game. I understand that there is lore and thats why characters should be grinded out, but it seems more forced upon you. This is mostly just my own take however. Its good and fun. N-Joy!

game, good, good game overall but on my nokia the loading screen is pretty long unlike my old samsung where I played there it was pretty fast
game, favorite, This is my favorite music game in mobile, I really recommend it, many songs need payment but there's also a lot of free too that are also good

game, good, Pretty good game but I have a slight problem,First of all it's so slow to load,Like everytime I open a character,I need to wait so long than what I remember in the past,And also everytime I cleared a song,THIS GAME KEEPS FREEZING!and because of that my score can't even get added and I'm very frustrated because of that😤

hours, many, Cytus II vastly improves from its predecessor in its styling, story telling, and mechanics. The drive to play the game is spurred on by the story and while it starts slow, a bit grindy at first, it quickly ramps up as the song selection increases overtime and you start hunting perfects. I've killed many hours on flights and on road trips with this game and am extremely happy overall. However, this is only true when it works. Each update has a chance of breaking the game until the next. It's sad.
scores, previous, I love this game but after the update sometimes the game just froze after playing some songs. Whats really annoying is you beating your previous scores and then the game just frozes
story, same, Well, the same old story: new device, lost all progress. Oh sure, all the stuff I paid for is accessible, but EVERYTHING is back to lvl. 1. So when I said 'accessible' I really meant 'unlockable again'. Done with this. Rayark, you just lost a former shark.

story, best, Cytus 2 has the best story I've seen in a mobile game. Period. 5 stars for that masterpiece! However, the game does have flaws. It crashes and freezes every now and then, it is a heavy game using too much system resources, it consumes battery like hell and has some annoying charts, some with flick notes that just refuse to register properly half of the time. Some charts are basically unreadable and some notes can be hit before the scan line reaches it. Also, has a bit too many costly paywalls.

app, new, New and Cool World. I like how it made use of a new Twitter app 😅 What i like most is the new world, some puzzle and cool characters. Made me think of how future will be if technology is more active. Good job. ❤️ P.S. i think the issue now is how the game loads and sometimes it takes minutes

margin, larger, Both Cytus 1 and 2 are more "forgiving" rhythm games, allowing a larger margin of inaccuracy than many others I've played before. However, it's still not easy, especially when you get to those higher difficulties. Warning: Chaos lvl and beyond may require more than 2 fingers! The game usually runs smooth as silk for me, but it sometimes lags or crashes. Sometimes the in-game videos (cutscenes basically) fail to play as well, so I need to play them again. Thankfully, you can rewatch all of them.

game, good, i really like the game, from its character to its plot and especially the fun levels. it's just that the game keeps hanging and forcing me to leave it. would definitely bump it up if the issue is fixed, it's a good game apart from that though.
accounts, other, I am so upset. I've spent hundreds of hours on this game, maxed every character, even spent money on Connor, and after this update, the game stopped working. I reinstalled it and tried to log into my google play account but every time I try, it fails and crashes the app. It only lets me log into other accounts that have no progress. I had such good scores, MM on most chaos levels, it's all gone now.

amount, high, The story is really interesting and amazing. But as a f2p player, my gameplay is limited because i'd have to pay an unreasonably high amount of money to unlock characters and other extra feature. My game have been lagging very hard recently too, its making me miss notes, please fix it soon

thing, Only, I absolutely love this game. Only thing is, after I have the first 3 at lvl 25, and ivy at lvl 10, the credits play, I hear the lines, "can you hear me?" And "vanessa" and then a song plays to a black screen. I waited for almost 5 minutes and didn't find anything? I re started the app but won't unlock their lvls... should I just wait longer?

update, last, Don't know what the company did on the last update, but it seems the touch DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY ANYMORE!! Gotta say this game hooked me so much, love the songs and all, but is not 5 stars because of 1 huge reason... apart from them selling you the game (however I don't regret buying it, at all) and reach some point where you gotta buy more songs and characters so you can still play it completely which is not fair, AND THE PRICES ARE NOT LOW. Please change this!!!

songs, fun, The game is great with fun songs, but the reason I didn't give 5 stars because the game had issues with game froze or display stop after completing the song. And I really hate have to close the game and reopen back just for playing. Otherwise it'll be perfect...
Experience, Terrible, Terrible Experience i have grind my levels offline and after I went online it suddenly showed me an an Æsir game then all went black after playing...then all my progress collapse and left with an error game not fully downloaded. WTH, such a dissapointment after wasting data downloading this game 2x issue not fix. Just got lucky I haven't purchase anything yet. Such a shame Iwas having a blast playing it then this made it terrible
bit, little, I think this update is a little bit disappointing the game is LAGING A LOT and i can't play properly because of the game sometimes crashing pls fix this because i can't enjoy the game.
games, best, Honestly one of the best mobile Rythm games out there. It has a pretty good story, as well as some really fantastic maps of all difficulties. The core gameplay idea behind the game is also great to keep me interested

😭, black, I can't open the app.. all black 😭 where did my 2GB go?!
MUCH, SOOO, LOOVE THIS SOOO MUCH Been playing cytus since the beginning of cytus (1). Just as I did buy everything in cytus 1, i did the same for this one too. I've done maxing up the base characters and got to the last glitch/story/credits...its amazing. everything abt this game is amazing. if there's another 1 in the making, I'll be supporting that too. hehehe. 🤩

thing, good, Only good thing about this game is the music and the story, but be prepared to spend a lot since more than half the characters are paid on an already paid game, the game's story is ambiguous at best without knowing the story of the paid characters. Game is overcharted to the point where charts have notes where there shouldn't be. The game drops inputs like a b*tch, specifically on long/multiple drag notes and on the horrendous flick notes, click-drag notes are specially bad.

characters, paid, Only good thing about this game is the music and the story, but be prepared to spend a lot since more than half the characters are paid on an already paid game, the game's story is ambiguous at best without knowing the story of the paid characters.

songs, other, I love the gameplay and all but the prices for other songs are REDICULOUS. 10$ for a new song? 1 or 2 dollars is understandable, but you could spare us our wallets.

music, decent, Why does this game have a story? I just wanted to play rhythm game with some decent music.
screen, black, ok vlgame but there is lots of crashes. i'm literally writing this review right after a crash happened the crashes aren't really frustrating but it's during songs that I think are catchy like for example aventyr every time I get to the screen where I'm gonna play it freezes and if I try to do anything else it's just a black screen and the most recent crash was when i was abt to play I'm just gonna call it "happiness" once it started it immediately froze but the music was still playing

packs, overpriced, Game is good, but i cant understand why there are so overpriced song packs. This should all be free because people already bought the game in the first place...

scenes, able, you should probably make the toturial say that its the toturial or have options like I have played this before or I am new to this game cause if you put the toturial after skip able cut scenes then the person is just gonna think its another scene the game is very fun.
things, long, Fun game but the long press things keeps making me think I have to- nvm it's fun
game, great, Well it is a great game but most of the characters are not free
download, free, Thanks for free download
game, fun, It's a fun game with great design but since the last update I've been experiencing alot of crashes. I hope the next update will fix it but for now it's almost unplayable which is a pity

good, Good, Good good
intro, Unskippable, Unskippable intro.
ending, first, Stuck in the first ending... The song won't stop even if I close the game
space, much, I love the game and all the songs. But when it updates, it gets weird. I have to unistall and re - install the game to update it. Because it will take up to much space if I just let it update normally.
transportation, public, Way better than Piano Tiles. I can't take public transportation without playing this. My only problem are these stories included in the game. I DO NOT CARE for the story at all. I just want to play! Add a frigging skip button. Such a waste of time. Also, why are some characters locked/maxed in their level? Just let me keep leveling them. This is my favorite game ever, but it has some really stupid minor flaws.

quality, superb, This game has a superb quality. I recommend it if you have play pass.
game, mobile, Rayark, please look into a bug that crashed the game mid play, also some characters take long to load (eg. the giraffe guy) Also bought all the story characters on sale, marking my highest mobile game purchase and still this is the only game that I've ever spent money on, BECAUSE ITS WORTH IT, cant wait for Deemo 2

musicians, actual, Okay, I like to concept of this rhythm game but it's been poorly executed. First they really need to have actual musicians review their tabs for the songs. Some of them are soo terrible, off beat, and unnatural. Second, massive pay walls everywhere. You already pay a big chuck to play the game and then it's only a couple songs. The rest of the song packs a ludicrously priced. $5 per song and they are poorly tabbed at that.

game, entire, Extremely disappointing. The story and music is ok, but the controls are buggy and hardly register. It constantly lags and crashes. Loading is ludicrously long and i need to restart the entire game just to switch screens. Not worth it.
version, first, Yes awesome and the first version so awesome i rate 5 starssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssasssssssssssssssssssssss!
game, cool, Pretty cool tech themed rhythm game

update, last, Optimization and performance has been really poor for the last update.
option, only, I like the game, though I've encountered some bugs, one of them is after I finished playing a song, the score display gets stuck and doesn't move so th only option is to close the app which makes the score erased, another thing is app crashes, happens sometimes, good thing is not in the middle of the game, though not in the middle of it, the app freezes sometimes for a few secs ending up me missing the notes. That's all I'll hope this gets fixed soon, I like this game thanks you!
