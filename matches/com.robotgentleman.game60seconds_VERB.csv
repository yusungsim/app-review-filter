suffers, from, flaw, This game is great,however it suffers from a massive flaw,the controls. I can't stress how many times i died from the klunky controls where its either hyper sensitive or just no.Terrible doesn't even describe it,if its fixed i would gladly give a 5 star review

was, to, it, I just gotta say, great game! I love the animation style, and the whole game is very fun to play. I just wish that there was a little bit more to it, some type of progression. Something like a career mode where you can earn a currency and spend it to level up different aspects, such as the items that spawn in your house, being able to level up from two hand spots to four, a cooler that spawns that has 5 food and 5 water, an upgrade that gives you more time to collect, etc.

do, with, bugs, could do better with bugs
playing, on, phone, The game is what you expect to buy a family surviving the apocalypse and playing the game on your phone. What I didn't expect when I brought the game is everytime when you start your game and gather supplies it would lag pretty bad. That's only problem I had and the pretty good at that point. I still don't know if it my phone or the games problem and would like to solve it.
used, to, them, The controls are not as bad as some other reviews may suggest; you just have to get used to them. All grabable items are highlighted in white, when you approach an item to select wait for the white outline to turn green, the item will now be in your reach to grab. I hope this is useful to help others figure out how to play. I have no complaints on this game other than it does become repetitive after a while. (although there are many different endings and challenges you can make an attempt at)

turn, on, Chromebook, Quite hard to turn the camera on Chromebook...
play, on, pc, First off i recommend you play this on pc but over all this is a fine mobile port
gets, at, times, Fun game, gets frustrating at times, but really great at others
play, on, rides, Super fun!!! And I love the challenges! It's great to play on car rides and whenever I have no internet. I would totally recommend this! Slightly addictive, but not that you would constantly play it. You play it whenever!
saw, from, YouTubers, Let me tell you something, when I saw what was available on mobile I got it right away, I only saw this game from the YouTubers I watched, after I got it, it had so much more then what I saw a year ago, and I won like a champ on my first try and smiling at the end of the day, recommended to anyone who likes a addictive game.

addicting, in, ways, Very fun got to think about how to survive man a lot of hard thinking sometimes to make sure you out live your other play throughs. Never know how it's going to end! That's the best part about the game very addicting in good ways! Keep the great work up!
break, on, collision, If objects could break easier on collision it would make the game 5x less frustrating.
agree, with, others, Fun game but I have to agree with others when mentioning the beginning when you're tasked with scavenging. It feels broken.
tasked, with, scavenging, Fun game but I have to agree with others when mentioning the beginning when you're tasked with scavenging. It feels broken.
end, with, anything, The game is fun, however in the collecting phase at the beginning it is SUPER hard to control the movement. Most of the time I can't get him to turn so I barely end up with anything. If the controls could be fixed, it would be even more fun!
play, with, modes, Super fun addicted game. Good to make time pass by. Easy to play with different modes
died, to, cats, Yessss! 116 days! This really shows I have no life. Anyways I died to the dumbass fridge cats >:/. But anyways that was fun. The game is good so yeah (also I was on little boy mode so the 116 days might not be as cool but shush I'm happy)
get, through, game, Hard to get through even one game on easy. It's not intuitive nor does it have any sort of manual. I love the idea but the execution needs a bit of work. The easiest mode should also allow for more time to grab items at the start. Why are family members not at all interested in getting in the bunker???

reintroduced, as, REATOMIZED", Pretty decent for what you get... HORRIBLE controls in the "collection phase" killed the fifth star...still fun as hell..... UPDATE....game has been fixed and reintroduced as "REATOMIZED"......DEVELOPERS SCREWING ME OUT OF MONEY YET AGAIN.........Zero stars for being a Greedy Commie

updated, in, year, DEAD GAME. Devs haven't updated in over a year.. good but gets boring fast.
pay, for, game, It's ridiculous you have to pay money for this game. It's also not that good of a game. I wouldn't play it for a very long trip. ☹️

take, on, phone, The movement feels very sluggish, dont take it on phone, stick with pc
pay, for, game, Bought the game and after an error I tried to uninstall it to reinstall and now it wants to charge me again. No. Why am I being forced to pay for a game I just paid for?! Don't bother.
reccomend, to, everyone, I enjoy playing this game, I reccomend it to everyone
running, on, computer, Hard to use while running on computer and gets very boring easily but intresting and good game
get, on, mobile, Love.it but can you make it easyier. to get stuff on mobile and freplay can u add dat
walking, on, ice, Movement is veey difficult in the apocalyspe gamemode. It's like your walking on ice.
do, with, joystick, The game was pretty nice it had nice graphics nice gameplay but my only problem is that moving around is very hard to do with the joystick
has, by, end, Very fun and I think it has suspenseful moments by the end
Stayed, on, screen, Downloaded it and it wouldnt load. Stayed on the loading screen. Disappointed
left, in, dust, There is now another separate paid version that has been updated/reworked and expanded. Sad to see that past purchasers have been left in the atomic dust. Unless this is really cheap I would buy the new version instead so you don't miss out on anything.

beat, on, try, I love the game i almost beat it on my first try but i did not even on little boy which it the easyist difficulty settings.

get, into, bunker, Game is not worth $4 lucky I have the game pass the concept isn't bad but the system for trying to pick up items is incredibly poorly designed. When you get into the bunker its incredibly boring the only thing you can really do is press a notebook and read a few pages maybe make a simple decision. The game is incredibly limited with very few variations to the story.
scavenging, like, version, I really love this game. I wish that the atomized version of this was smoother with scavenging like this version is!! It's so creative and I love playing. Although, I think that if the parents die or get captured, that you should be able to play as the kids,,,

make, at, game, It's like the fallout of mobile and it does look like fallout love the mechanics,story,and the fact that you have to make a strategy at the start great game love it.
happens, to, characters, It is a lot of pressure but it is a lot of fun I am not disappointed the game has great quality and is fun kinda wish you could check and see what happens to the characters when the go outside but other than that I love the game
play, with, challenges, This is a great game! I would 100% recommend it, Lots of ways to play the Game with challenges, survival Scavenging and full on apocalypse! The Easy, normal and hard modes are also pretty balanced! Cons: Sometimes movement in the house can be glitchy makeing it slightly hard to get stuff, Costs money (but I personally think its worth it) I could go on about this game but ill leave you with this,

think, through, choices, Pretty cool game. A lot of endings. Although, it takes brain. You really must think through your choices, it's not just random. The game is unpredictable most of the time but that's what makes it fun, wondering would could happen next! You really gotta think about who you're gonna send out and think about endings! Honestly, it is not an easy game. It's actually quite hard. I think my only complaint really is the entertainment I get out of it. It does get boring , sometimes I fail after I get really far and then try again and again. After so many tries, the game can get *so* boring, a lot of reading has to be done too. I'm fully aware that this game Is *not* new, yet , I don't think it's changed much.

play, on, page, Theres a bug that i cant play on the main page it froze and it keeps doing that and i can play if you fix the bug i give 5 stars thank you
controls, for, scavenging, The fact that your paying rm16 for this game is ridiculous , everything is basically same as pc version , great game but movement controls for scavenging is sosososo bad 😶 fix the movement issue and it'll be fine
stuck, on, things, I want to love this game but the scavenger controls are complete trash. You get stuck on mundane things around your house scavenging. Remove the crashing into lamps and everything in the house which block off sectors once the shotty controls bump you into them.

play, on, mode, The game has really good potential...but the controls in the beginning when you have to run and collect food are so hard to use...many times I'm not able to move my character around...or they move too much. The game is also incredibly hard to play on apocalypse mode. Even on easy...i have never "won". I have done 10 play through and not a single time did I make it past 50 days without dying from something. I'd really like to continue playing...it has good promise, but I will prob stop soon

download, for, devices, Do not download for mobile devices but u can its jusf hard to play wif omly play on pc
read, in, guess, Poor control, plus I don't care to read a storyline in a game guess this is why I play survival games that needs no story or what's happening give me a vile of hp and thirst and sickness and leave it at that

hit, in, front, The game is very good indeed, but the controls to move the adults are very bad, you can't move the camera fast because you will hit anything in front of you and sometimes when you are close to a wall the character just stick to it and you can't move any longer, please fix the controls, improve them by trying them in game :3

entertaing, at, school, I like doing the challenges 😊 it's really fun and entertaing at school, my friends find my outbursts hilarious 😑
use, for, part, Fun! Controls are hard to use for the scavenge part which made it not as fun :/ but still worth a try!
have, for, beginning, Not as fun as you'd expect as you only get to have fun for the beginning of the round but after its just a matter of choosing what to do and it can get boring after a while.

played, in, heart, Its the best game I've played in a year heart 60 seconds
update, in, update, I cant update im in the 2016 update
send, outside, you, I love this game but I wish when u send someone outside you control them
look, at, bottom, Amazing 😍 But... The challenges are really hard. But when you complete them you earn hats and other stuff. And it shows you what you have to get before you start. And it also shows you who the decorations are for if you look at the bottom
Fun, for, hours, Fun for a few hours then becomes repetitive
recommend, on, mobile, It's a great game on PC but on mobile the beginning 60 seconds of a game needs such precise movement sometimes that it's very difficult to get a good run on mobile, wouldn't recommend on mobile but on PC 100% fine and 5 outta 5 game
control, on, phone, Really hard to control on cell phone. Tried to download it for my desktop, but there is other game stuff you have to have before you can actually get the game. Would not recommend to play on cell.

act, in, drill, I love this game it shows you how to act in a real drill and it's only 4 dollars I love it.
contacted, for, refund, I had an unauthorized charge for this game, came to found out it was my brother. I contacted you guys multiple times for a refund but never got a response. Now you guys have forced me to contact google support. These people steal your money even if you didnt buy it.
located, throughout, house, The control scheme is terrible. Sensitivity is extremely high in the rotation of movement and the walking makes it difficult to use the screen to see what and where items are located throughout the house. You use the left have of the screen to move, which your hand would cover a good chunk of the screen and it's the same with the rotation used on the right side. Definitely not worth having on a portable device.

using, on, cromebook, I love this game however using it on my cromebook is just the pits. Please allow me to use a mouse and I would give 1000 stars.
PRONOUNCE, ON, OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, OMG!! I THINK I JUST BEATED THE GAME BECAUSE IT SAID THE ENDS BUT THE KIDS WERE STILL ALIVE SO I THINK THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT I'M SAD THAT TED DIDN'T COME HOME BUT OH MY GOD I GOT SO MUCH XP PLUS I GOT ME AND MARY JANE I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU PRONOUNCE HER NAME ON DAY 9 WOW OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!
navigate, with, way, The beginning part where you're in the house and collecting stuff is pretty unplayable. I tried to play it, I really did, but I could not navigate with the way the collision system works. I got stuck on practically every obstacle.

missing, from, it, Interesting game, but something is missing from it. I can't place what it is. It was fun while it lasted but it didn't keep my attention long.
useing, for, it, Really fun game so many twists and all of that tje longest I survived for was 101days and i won 😅 Fun game I did not buy it (yet) (If im aloud to😒) Im useing play pass for it so I reccomend to buy and play it passes 15mins---1hr of fun 🤙🤙🤙🤙Recommend for everyone🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙

playing, in, middle, Feel asleep while playing this in the middle of the day.
ties, with, perasecs, I love the part that ties this game with 60 perasecs. "Astro civilin"
played, on, computer, boring, i also played it on computer so it was diffucult
Like, With, This, It's A Challenging Game And It Has Originality. I Like The Art Style With This Also It's Suggested To Download This It's A Cool Game
clicking, on, arrow, It's... OK and has promise, but it's a bit too clunky and you don't really do much, quite a lot of just clicking on the forward arrow.
going, to, screen, game keeps going to a black screen plz fix
play, on, phone, Great game but when you play on phone it's hard😄
occurring, in, order, Good, but not as good as the second game. Controls are messy, especially in the collection phase, and every run is practically the same, with the same random events occurring in the same order most of the time.
get, past, screen, Looked fun, can't get past loading screen. Not worth it, and it's obvious the creators don't actually care.
move, throughout, house, This game is so fun and interesting I would definitely recommend this game.one problem though is the controls to move throughout the house is a little lagging and to grab stuff is very hard
got, after, games, Very good game the reason I give it 3 stars is when u start and u have to grab iteams to survive it's terribly hard to control but the game is fun. I got bored a bit after 3 games so maybe make it a bit funner
say, for, it, It's a good game, and that's all the good things I have to say for it. The controls are terrible and the selection process are worse than not intuitive, they hardly work at all. With time and effort it can be learned, but rather than doing that Id recommend just getting it on a different platform instead.

seeing, to, game, Game is really nice to play. Haven't been seeing any updates to this game in terms of scenarios. I played for quite a bit, and now it's just getting a bit boring for me, personally. Still a great game.

Gets, after, min, Gets boring after like 5 min
optimized, for, screens, Not optimized for non-16:9 screens. Controls are a nightmare. You tap on joystick and it appears in absolutely different place, away from your finger, which makes it impossible to play the game.

gets, after, while, Controls are god awful, want a good nuclear apocalypse game? Get sheltered, so much better than this piece of garbage on phone. Edit- I did, the controls and horrid and the overall game gets boring after a while.
get, at, stage, I love the game but here I have some new endings avatar ending if you don't get the scientist ending and your at the last stage you get a robot from them and if you fix the robot enough it will save you the the Santa ending is if you help Santa prepare for chromas hell save you

bought, on, mobile, I reallt love this game! I bought it on mobile because it was way more expensive on steam!
pay, for, this, Why do you have to pay for this
has, to, it, Fun game, has a horrible histories type vibe to it with the art style and humour. Scavenge can be kinda clunky but it's a part of the challenge I guess, enjoyed though, would recommend.

get, in, game, I CAN'T EVEN PLAY It won't let me get in the game I got this a few months ago and it stopped working DO NOT BUY
left, because, starvation, Its GREAT! But.. mutant Mary jane was starving so I fed her. But then it said "Mary jane has left the bunker because of starvation"
add, like, keyboard, It's a pretty decent game. But if you can add external devices like a keyboard that would be better. Just wondering if you can add this feature
HAD, TO, SUPPLIES, Best game ever! I LITTERLY WAS SO ADDICTED I ACTTED LIKE I HAD 60 SECONDS TO DO EVERYTHING AND HAD A DREAM I HAD 60 SECONDS TO COLLECT SUPPLIES BEFORE A TKRNADO CAME! Ik its a tornado and not a nuke, BUT STILL CLOSE! Worth the money and i would pay 50$ for the game!

play, without, WiFi, Now this game is about a situation most people don't know about by gives you a good view, and there lots of challenges and you can make up your own! And you can play it without WiFi which I have a problem finding. But anyway this is a good game and would recommend! :)
glich, for, me, I love it it doesn't glich for me so I give it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
give, ⭐, ⭐, I love it it doesn't glich for me so I give it 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
happen, in, life, Its scary to think it might happen in real life
account, for, play, This really deserve s a 0 stars because I didn't even get to play the stupid game I've waited 1HOUR for it to load but it never did this "game" sucks:edit:nevermind I relized I had to get and account for Google play and then I could play I give it a 5
control, for, players, Play pass review: its pretty poggers i must say, reding gets boring though. But its a price to pay; pther then that the game is prwtty well made. Maybe update the scavenging controls though, its hard to control for new players. :)
join, like, %, Rlly fun aside from the controls and when ever i try join the game like 90% of the time i get froze at the 60 secs can load screen and i cant do anything and ill keep trying to join but it wont work.

Fun, on, toilet, Fun on the toilet
missed, on, hours, I just want a refund but I missed out on the 48 hours it's to late please help 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
stuck, on, thethings, AMAZING controls are amazing but i gwt stuck on thethings in the house but its not bad at all defenitaly download this!!!
playing, on, computer, I love the game but im playing it on a computer and it would only let me use the joystick
Beware, of, refunds, I couldn't move my thumbs ticket that well while getting supplies. Plus it won't let me refund my stuff. Beware of no refunds.
move, around, walking, Pretty bad but kind of good because you can barely move the screen around the walking barely works and it's not even 60 seconds it should be called 30 seconds because of how fast the timer is I wish you could have non useful items because I would just grab whatever I can grab but I would get the end because I didn't grab anything Important fix these thing and it will be a higher review
pay, for, it, Would love to see the DLC, I would definitely pay for it, and I think others would too!
make, to, shelter, The game was awful especially the controls it was extremely hard to control and I couldn't make it to the shelter in time because of the stupid controls so if you fix the controls I will give a higher review.

compared, to, version, Mobile controls makes the initial 60 seconds grabbing rush a bit rough, compared to PC version, but other than that it is a solid resource management game.
play, on, mobile, The games fine just really hard to play on mobile
paid, for, game, I paid for this game and it doesn't let me download. Doesn't let me refunded it. This is a scam!!!!!!
gets, after, while, It's a pretty cool game but it's pretty long and after a while it gets boring. Also the controls aren't very easy to use.
scavenge, in, house, I wish I could go scavenge for supplies the same way I scavenge in the house. The game has potential but unfortunatly the way it is right now is difficult to really enjoy.
won, on, day, I won on day like 8 kinda lame how its that easy
get, in, game, I spent a WHOLE HOUR it won't load or get me in the game Robot Gentleman has to fix this
work, for, me, The controls really don't work for me and it waste the time
skipped, to, scenario, Worth the effort. I played the first couple of scenarios (i.e. the drill, etc) and was just about to uninstall, thinking this game wasn't quite for me.. and then I skipped to the 4th and last scenario which was just "Survival"... and I'm glad I did because it turns out I just wasnt a fan of the "Scavenge" scenario (yet). The game has great replayability, solid music, and pleasant sense of humor. I'll be playing this game for some time to come now. :)

got, to, shelter, Loved the game. Just the game was glitched and said "The end" every time I got to the shelter. I get that if you don't gather important stuff you loose. But I gathered everything but the lock and I still got the "The End"

have, on, computer, Love the game. However i have it on the computer as well and am curious as to why there is not truck on the mobil version.
got, On, top, I did not enjoy my experience. The waiter would not give me time to order. On top of that they still even got my order wrong
smooth, with, responce, I kinda like it but its just not much there, intro is good but shelter begs for more. mostly its laggy n not smooth with responce, why in not having jaksht going on, it missing somting to be even called a game. Xpeia z4

glitch, For, me, I love the game! But there are some bugs. For me they glitch.
refund, on, play, It is an ok game but will not let me refund it on Google play
loading, since, yesterday, The game isnt loading since yesterday
scavenge, for, secs, Lots of potential, need an option of upping the 60 sec clock, also it would be great if you got chances to go back and scavenge for another 30 secs when you send someone up?? I think each family member should count as one item. Unless I'm missing something the whole game is based on choices in a diary. You cant interact with anything in the shelter.

take, to, shelter, I thought this was the game I saw all those years ago and it's still just as clunky. I guess it's part of the gameplay but the stiff and awkward controls kill this for me, plus the fact that family members can't take themselves to the shelter. Are they crippled? Handicapped? Just plain stupid probably, regardless of their intelligence level they should be able to bring themselves to a damn hole in the floor. So, the controls & lack of family ability to walk are what made me uninstall.😞🖕🏾🚬

played, for, years, I've played this for years I deleted it because I got grounded but I just redownloaded it and its amazing I love it
suck, for, seconds, I enjoy this game a lot. I would love to give you guys five stars but the controls suck for the 60 seconds we have to get equipment and supplies. Otherwise this game rocks.
got, For, me, Fun game, I used to see it a lot. For me it got a little boring after time and I would get stuck while trying to scavenge.

play, in, 2020, It's Really Good I play it everyday even though I play in 2020 and I have won 16 time and it's so fun almost everyday I listen to 60 Seconds the musical from random encounters

grab, in, minute, The game is fine I like to grab what I can in a minute but moving around is pretty hard on mobile to get everything I need :,) and it can be laggy and slow sometimes when stuff is loading.
make, like, launch, their is a few thing that show that they tried to make people injoy the game but the cost makes some people have to turn away from getting the game because they don't have money but the game is End of the world survival 💯 % but, the beginning they should make like a uninspired launch of a dangerous wepon and when you first play the nuclear bomb launch should be on TV 📺, he gets up and then goes in the start passion and then it goes to the start of that game. Over all it is a good game.

keep, except, controls, Awesome game despite the cost I saw one of my favorite youtubers play it and wanted to try it myself it's a great game that can keep you entertained for a while, except the controls at the beginning to gather items are hard on PC. Otherwise great game and I love it!

play, on, PC, It's cool but I'd rather you play on PC because like it's very bad cuz like the controls are very bad and it's just it's just messes you up still great game but it's just a controls
freezes, on, screen, It is a 5 star game but I rated 4 stars because I can only get one game out of it before it freezes on the home screen. It might just be my phone, but it could also be a bug. Other than that it is an amazing game and it is so much fun!! 10/10 would recommend
Stuck, on, screen, Same as others have said. Stuck on loading screen so I can't even play.
spend, on, rip, Its probably the worst game you could ever spend money on its a total rip off dont make my mistake take my word for it.

survive, on, expeditions, 60 seconds is a good offline game you have to figure out what to do and to grab and survive the Wasteland on expeditions
move, on, mobile, Its an okay game, but its kinda hard to move around on mobile.
work, for, me, unfortunately, the game won't work for me and is stuck on the the title screen.

is, after, playthroughs, Good but short, after a few playthroughs and all the challenges there is nothing much to do.
control, at, start, Hard to control at the start of the round
edit, into, one, HEY DEVELOPERS! Please edit the image of the water bottle into a much bigger one. So that a glass turns into a bottle, you know what I'm saying? Otherwise it's too unrealistic, no one can survive 4 days without water after they just had 1 little glass. Soup is good. Water is too small. I'm only talking about the look of them, not game mechanics.

got, in, bunker, Whenever i got in the bunker it would kick me out of the whole game
scavenging, for, things, Amazing. Only complaint is that when you are scavenging for things its super hard to collect them because walking is hard.
paid, for, this, Doesn't even work. I paid for this and it was stuck on a picture for 10 mins straight. Don't get this app it's a waste of money. I just bought a picture. Edit: I reinstalled this game multiple times. it will sit on the soup can screen forever. I never even got to play the game. This game should be fixed immediately, or taken down.

running, around, controls, I didn't enjoy this game as much as 60 parsecs. In the beginning when you're running around the controls feel really awkward and aren't really optimised for touchscreen gameplay. I know it's supposed to feel a little clumsy but it's crossed the threshold of goofy and entered frustrating. The apocalyptic setting also crossed the line of dark humour a little. All in all a little bit worse than 60 Parsecs, which is a shame because I really enjoyed that.

give, like, stuff, I like this game so much and give me like the good stuff I did only the stuff and then I survived
waiting, for, refund, I am so tired of waiting for refund
pay, for, game, The game is fun but gets boring after reading the same things over and over. I don't see why you have to pay for the game when it is just a story/bunker survival game. I won't hate on the game because it is entertaining but I just dont get the point in having to pay for it other than the creators wanting to make a quick buck.

add, to, ipad, Good game saw my fav youtuber play it so please also add 60 parsecs to ipad also bc i saw my fav youtuber play it too!!! 😀😀😀
stuck, on, something, This is incredibly frustrating, even when I have food water and the rest of my family in the shelter I get stuck on something and dont have a chance to get to the shelter and even tho they had food and water I died and had to restart its annoying and I'm not playing it

hesaw, on, it, I want to refund this purchase but i cannot since its out of google play store policy could you give me refund gentle robot because i was at a sleep over at my friends house and i forgot my tablet there and since hesaw money on it he bought this app and played it but i told him not to so i am very upset currently because i didnt plan on buying this game.thanks
reminds, of, Fallout, Amazing game with great throwback feels. It reminds me of Fallout a LOT. The only things I think don't work very well are how weird the controls are and respond, and during the scavenge section, the other family members are completely brain-dead.
bought, on, store, I bought this on the app store about a year or so ago, and it was as fun as I thought it would be! I tried playing another round again recently, and the game no longer loads up. Truly sad since it was so fun, hopefully the developer fixes this one day!
mean, by, call, Hey,i wanna refund bucause i cant send you anything. I mean by email call and more. It is to bad bucause the price the colecting the surviving stuff its al hard hard hard
play, like, gloom, This game is awsome it realy gets youre adrenaline up and pumping and huge youtuber play it like gloom,cubscputs,and more
get, on, game, It used to be fun but now i cant even get on the game. Itll show the loading screen but it kicks me off. Ive had the game for a couple months though and its really fun even though ive never had an ending. I downloaded it because my favourite youtuber KubzScouts played it and i really wanted to try it. I would have given 5 stars if it still worked

ported, to, mobile, The game is great, I'm glad it got ported over to mobile.
gets, into, bunker, Its an ok game, but its a pain to actually start good. If you want to get good equipment you can't hold much of it, plus your family is required. You also can't play the game unless everyone gets into the bunker (from personal experience when i last played). The controls are also super finicky. You can be holding forward on the "joystick" thingy but you'll barely move at all. Plus you can be right next to the biggest item and it be impossible for you to grab it. There's no grab button, just pres

gets, after, game, Boring, has potential but all your doing is reading ... the characters dont even move or have small animations when sending them out or equipping them.. Just alot of reading ,it gets old after 1 game I wish I never wasted the money lol
seen, on, Drea, As seen on Drea
play, on, tho, Great game really fun not that easy to play on mobile tho
had, on, it, Purchased game and didnt download. Went to see what happened and noticed it still had the price on it. So I assumed it didnt purchase so tried again and got an error saying I already owned the game. Still charged twice for it. Edited 9/20/20. Second charge was automatically cancelled and I am now able to download the game. Still dont know what happened.

stand, in, area, Do not like it and you only stand in that stupid little area where you do nothing waiting for somebody to die or see how much days you survive that's a poor game nobody gives about this game

played, in, way, I love this game it's dark but in a fun way I've played this game like a million times and I still love it to this day my only complaint is that getting what you need in the beginning is super hard to do because you have to face what you're trying to pick up which is hard cuz it's really wonky but overall great game 10/10

puts, on, me, The game is great. I love having a time limit it puts more pressure on me. But the thing I dislike is when you get stuck one an object. Then it takes away more time to get off. Or haveing and two objects blocking the door way. But over all the game is amazing!
used, to, it, This game is so much fun!!😍😝 its easy to play when you get used to it and its just really fun to play in down time!🤍 I love it!! And if you watch KubScouts its easier to play!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😝😝
added, in, controls, A little iffy. The mobile contols are hard when your collecting stuff, but it would be nice if you added in controls for a touchscreen chromebook that works on the keyboard. Thank you!

gets, for, game, It gets kinda boring for a game the is 3.99 their should be a little more gameplay and it gets really glitchy not all the time butt some times. I mean I'll recomend to play it but not spend 4 dollars on it

Use, In, Minute, Honestly, I Recommend Playing This, Though My Sister Has To Do The Food Scavenging. I Like To Use The Random Mode Where You Don't Have To Select Your Items From The Start In One Minute. And If You Aren't As Good As Playing On The Scavenging Version, Just Pick The Random Mode. And Honestly, By The Time I'm Writing This, I Still Haven't Got Mutant Mary Jane But It's My Dream.

get, on, computer, Pretty good. You get more challenges on computer but pay more. You lose nothing from the basic gameplay which is so nice. Definetly worth it.

moving, on, phone, good game but just chalinging moving around on A phone
surprising, in, game, Very good strategy game for people who like reading, random chance, and nuclear explosions! There are things I have never seen still surprising me today in this game.
look, at, object, Really good game just need to improve the grab you have to directly look at the object you want to pick up
grab, from, house, The game is good! You have to grab stuff from your house, I love it! Plz make more😁
spent, on, game, I am extremely aggravated I spent 3 dollars on this game for it not to load in on my HTC phone!

get, to, bunker, This game was fun until now. Everytime I play the sixity seconds its fine but when I get to the bunker it says 'The End' and wont let me play. This has happened repeatedly. Its disappointing for a 4 dollar game. If you can fix it then no complaints from me.
sign, into, account, Good idea but not well executed. Controls and screen freeze/lag badly and regularly have to sign into Google account which is all very annoying. Very quick learning curve which is great and graphics are nice. Only played classic apocalypse but majority of the game was reading out of a notebook and didn't have opportunities to leave to scavenge. Lost interest in reading the somewhat repetitive notebook around day 5 and only hung in hoping I would be able to do something else. Alas no.

mean, from, me, Fun but really hard i mean really hard at least from me
control, on, screen, The controls are on the left side of the screen and way too difficult to maneuver! Would be fun if you could just control him on the screen like every other game. Glad I did not purchase this!

gets, for, me, It's an OK game it gets boring for me but I'm sure if you give it a try you would love it.
load, into, game, I cannot even load into a game I paid for! And the support is not responding after weeks of of contacting them! Happy to change my review if they got back to me.

get, in, shelter, I keep losing every time I do scavenge I get in the shelter and everyone is dead and I dont even do anything
made, with, lots, Very fun game, well made and very funny with lots of diffrent situations and challenges. Only thing I would like to see is more interactive play like in the first 60 seconds for the scavenging, maybe when one of your characters goes exploring you could play as them? Maybe narration aswell, I don't mind reading but I was playing for an hour yesterday and can get a bit cloying having to read to play. Other than that fantastic highly recommend.

try, for, myself, Extremely fun! I've watched numerous YouTubers play this game and thought to try it out for myself. It's very smooth, the controls are easy to understand and you only need them for 60 seconds of the game anyway. 😂 You basically have 60 seconds to scavenge materials from your house and then survive as long as possible with your resources. It's great if you're into survival and fallout/post-apocalyptic games.

pops, in, mind, Boring game the the Scavenging part at the beginning of the game is horribly done can't get nothing can't get out of the rooms I always get blocked by things n that's the only fun part the rest is reading maybe kuz I've played this war of mine it instantly pops up in my mind and is done better
work, on, 😢, Love the game but it doesn't work on my Iplus 8 😢
used, to, it, So the 60 seconds part kinda sucks but after doing the challenges you get used to it. It isn't that bad after you do the 60 seconds like 20 times. I love the game play and again the challenges. I would like to see more challenges in the future though. Great game

make, to, shelter, Doesn't work right, items don't want to pick up, sometimes the game doesn't think you're in the safezone despite dropping items, items don't always make it to the shelter, and sometimes even people. Trash game that needs fixing, tried 10 time and didn't even make it to the actual survival aspect because of issues in the first part.

gets, in, opinion, Fun a lot of replay ability but it in my opinion gets boring pretty fast
like, for, reasons, I like this game very much for some tipical reasons.You can end your game in alot opportunities, many games dont typicaly have these and so makes the game even boring.There is alot of choices you can do in this game .I suggest if you are looking for a game to play it has to be 60 seconds.You can even watch various videos made on this game like Kubz Scouts and many more!

move, on, mobile, Controls could be better can barely move on mobile
playing, at, night, It's a time killer! It's fun and good for playing at night.
play, on, iPad, I play this game on iPad. This game has great challenges and all that stuff. I absolutely love this game. Can't describe how much I do. A thing you could add though, is a cup once some of the water is used. I understand that probably don't bring cups into the shelter, but if they could, that would be great. Another thing they could do is bring blankets. That would make them more comfortable if you think of this as a real life situation. But in total this game is GREAT. Thanks.

love, in, shelter, I love it when i run my best food and water is four and supplies are good and I have tablet, I love when I'm running and... in the shelter to but I only have one thing to say:thar should be a push button like Timmys toys are in the way and you have 10 seconds left,but it take 2-4 seconds to push it out of your path But I hope this game gets better and better.
ranging, from, chalinges, It worth the money it goves many difrent modes to play ranging from chalinges to actule game play i soggest if you can get it

get, in, position, Interesting concept but the controls are terrible! A lot of the time is spent backing up and getting to get in the right position to grab and drop off an item. Immediately uninstalled.
play, on, phone, Omg best game easy to play on phone but i gave it only 4 stars cause it is really hard to play the game on a laptop that is not touthscreen saddly but still really good game

hate, as, app, I honestly hate this as an app and would like a refund for it. The controls are absolutely terrible even on easy. Besides that it would actually be a good game but considering you have to rely on the controls to gather stuff, it completely takes the fun out of it.

waiting, for, something, I think it could be really fun but I cant figure out the controls once I'm in the actual shelter. Maybe I'm dumb..that's possible. But other than reading the manual, I have NOTHING to do. Am I not waiting long enough for something to happen? AM I dumb? Is there instructions that tell u how to do things?
made, in, 2018, The controls ar AWFUL really Awful I HATE T he controls Omg- I made this in 2018 it's actually a good game I play it on laptop now!

use, in, start, I've always wanted to play it and when I did it wasn't what I really expected but I used to watch Markiplier play it. The controls can use a little bit of work in the start of the game.
think, of, things, Very fun and entertaining, also it makes you think of the things people would go through in a nuclear war, I find this game very entertaining.
go, in, war, Very fun and entertaining, also it makes you think of the things people would go through in a nuclear war, I find this game very entertaining.
makes, during, part, The controls are awful! It takes so many taps to pick up items and to select rations that the game is super frustrating. I enjoy the gameplay for the most part but during the scavenging part the lack of response grabbing things makes the game near unplayable in my opinion.

survive, with, bunker, 60 seconds is so much fun you can get all the supplies you need yourself or you can survive with a already packed bunker and try to survive you can send people outside to get more water food and other supplies it is so much fun I really recommend this game for anyone.

done, in, minutes, I bought it an hour ago but it keeps saying your order is processing it will be done in a few minutes ITS BEEN AN HOUR!
gets, after, while, I like the game but it gets boring after a while that's why I gave it 3 stars
suffice, as, killer, It's okay...I appreciate where the developers were going, but sadly I just never felt fully gripped. The experience is very repetitive and doesn't really suffice as a true time-killer due to the lack of actual gripping gameplay or narrative.

play, with, friends, I love this app it's so fun and challenging! I would've put a five but I think you guys should add a multiplayer so we chould play with friends , like your friends can be like deloris , timmy , maryjane, or the dad. And get stuff together. It probably dont make sense. Plzz take up on my suggestion!! Thank you!

stuck, in, front, It's fun except the furniture gets stuck in front of the doors sometimes and then I have to restart
prefer, to, version, I actually prefer this to the PC version, because the start gathering phase controls are odd. The whole reading the story thing is kinda boring, but it makes it a whole lot easier and cheap to make.
threw, over, mug, I HATE THIS APP SO MUCH, OMG! My grandson used this and threw up his orange juice all over my favorite mug. Smh wow that's truly a good game wow. It's so over rated I hate it, delete this Satan spawn of an app, Edit: Yes I know I added 5 stars, it means bad review smh.
freezes, on, screen, It always freezes on the loading screen!😬😬😬😬😬😬
got, because, Scouts, It is a pretty good game I only got this because of Kubz Scouts if you know who that is but the touch sensitivity can be better and add more endings etc and I would give 5 stars but overall good game.
cares, about, scout, Who cares about kubz scout or gloom playing the game
Challenging, for, me, Its Challenging for for me at least which makes it fun
play, for, years, I've been watching Kubz Scouts play for years! Amazing game and I like that you can apply different strategies and how real life mechanics are set in place. (Water every 5 days, on the sixth you die. Food every 9 days on the tenth day you may die depending on the level) it's an awesome game and I would recommend! Samsung Galaxy J3 luna pro Edit: Ive switched phones and it works just as great on Galaxy S10+ and my boyfriend has it on his Iphone 11 pro max and it works great for him too.

Got, after, day, Got very boring after one day
love, during, mode, Great game but me and many others, from YouTube, would love to have a multiplayer mode, during this mode it would be Tsar Bomb automatically. You would have to pick your character and the game could randomly decide whether Ted or Dolores are in charge of the food. Mary-Jane and Timmy could help collect stuff when first gathering equipment but only have two slots and as Mary-Jane is larger she could walk slower. During the time your character is out scavenging each day they could be out looking.
played, in, time, Its the best game i have played in a life time !!!!!!
bought, during, distancing, Tomato soup tastes gross (I bought 10 cans of them during social distancing).
stuck, on, screen, Is it only me who is stuck on the opening screen I dint know how to come onto the game and play as it freezes each time I go on it can someone please help me.

recommend, to, anyone, Love the game I recommend it to anyone over 12 years old

hoped, for, challenges, Kinda hoped for the mini challenges to update i did them a l l :(
spend, on, game, I spend 5 dollars on this game and it wont even load
looking, for, food, It's OK but on tablet it like very glitchy and when I do that scavenge looking for food and when I stop it just take me to here but please fix that
recommend, for, use, Hard to play. It is very hard to scavenge around. I thought it was going to be a lot more like the PC version, but it's not. It's a fun game, but is just hard to use. I wouldn't recommend it for mobile use.
Keeps, on, edge, Terrific. Keeps you on edge for the entire round, and lets you choose what you want to play. Great job developers, definitely worth the price!
stuck, on, screen, This game sucks because it keeps on getting stuck on the same screen.I HATE this game.
reatomized, with, it, No reason for 1 star so 5 stars but can you put reatomized with it too

use, as, one, Really great and interesting game, I really enjoy survival games that use resource management as one of the core mechanics and this game nailed it. Only complaint is the controls in the beginning stage when you scavenge for resources is very wonky. You turn, then walk, then turn, then walk, all the while you are trying to move past everything you have accidentally knocked over. I hope the creators continue with this ambition though. Great game, despite the crappy controls.

results, in, disadvantage, A good game with a frustrating port. While the day-to-day bunker gameplay works fine, the 60 second scavanging run is horrible on tablet. The performance of this 3D section is pretty bad, and there are no graphical settings. The touch controlls don't work very well, using an unreliable virtual joystick. This results in a big disadvantage, compared with the pc version. You would need 10 additional seconds to collect the same amount. You restart that section 10-20 times to get decent items.

become, after, while, Incredible title. A unique concept, cool artstyle, and fun gameplay make this a perfect buy, especially considering it's cheap pricetag. The gameplay is addicting and challenging: it offers a perfect blend between skill and RNG. Admittedly, the gameplay can become quite stale after a while, but as long as you set goals to motivate yourself, that shouldn't happen for a very long time. I Highly recommend this game!
