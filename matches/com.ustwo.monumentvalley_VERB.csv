beat, in, hrs, Not worth the money. It was easy. I beat it in probably 1n half hrs almost not trying. Ive spent less on games that lasted months. I want a refund.

put, into, game, Definitely worth every second you put into this game. I really enjoyed every aspect of the game, development to art. Thanks for a great puzzle game❤️.
blew, through, them, Wish I could give this a million stars!!! The creators of these Monument Valley games are absolutely brilliant! Just can't express how amazing it is... Just sad I blew through them all b/c I couldn't put it down. (And per suggestion in Monument Valley 1 I made a sizable donation to do 1 of my favorite charities.) Hoping for 3rd soon!!

pay, for, levels, It's an okay game but it's not nearly as long as it should be for a paid app, and the fact that you're asked to pay for extra levels once you've already paid to download the game? I found that to be outrageous. Don't buy this game if you're expecting hours of fun. You get maybe one hour of game play and then have to pay for more.

agree, with, reviews, Beautiful, peaceful game with some very nice storytelling. I agree with some reviews that it's not very difficult, but I don't think that's a bad thing, it's sort of a meditative experience.
included, in, level, I absolutely love this game I see no problems with it, there's no ads and no bugs from my knowledge. It's just pure gameplay and I find it really cool that the levels are set up the way they are, and how there are so many illusions included in one level! If you're looking for a fun puzzle game this is definitely what you want!

finish, in, day, Lovely, clever little game. The Escher style layouts are very interesting and some times tricky to see your way out. Only downside is that it is not very long, and you can finish it in a day.
imitated, to, death, Such a cool idea but now that it has been imitated to death it's interesting to go back to the original and see how it holds up. Answer: not so well. There's hardly a game here, it's all super linear with the next step being obvious 80% of the time.
completed, in, days, I completed both versions of this game in less than two days. It is joyfully confusing, and so incredibly fun. Huge props to the developers for designing such a clean and crisp game, and for coming up with amazing levels that are all so entertaining.

played, for, time, I played this game for the first time many years ago. Monument Valley (including its associated expansions and sequel) still stands as my favorite.

see, with, eyes, The game is beautiful, the soundtrack is so relaxing; and the puzzles are amazing. The way the game challanges you to see the world with other eyes in order to solve the puzzles is incredible. The logic of the game can be hard to grasp at first, but once you understand it, each level is a joy. Level 6 really touched me.

use, for, games, A very well made, yet short game. Takes under 2 hours to complete. It makes sense to use Play Pass for games like this, instead of buying them (but you might want to buy this and support the developer instead).
blowing, at, time, This is one of my favourite games ever. Its so beautiful. The puzzles arent too tricky but mind blowing at the same time. Its got a lot of the impossible triangle and stuff and i love that kind of thing. Such a beautiful game thats very high on my list. Definitely not a waste of money.

Respect, for, masterpiece, Stunning visual arts, simple gameplay. Respect the developers for this masterpiece!
wait, until, Monument, Awesome and fun puzzle game, can't wait until Monument 3.

know, about, update, Re-download when i came to know about The Lost First update. 4 amazing beautifully crafted levels and a serene BGM to go with. Thank you for the update and I've signed the Play4Forests petition, i hope everyone does as well. We must save what's left of our forests before it's too late.

go, into, software, Excellent game. The people complaining that they have to pay have no idea how much work, time and money go into designing software like this.
borders, on, bizarre, A special kind of game only for a special kind of player. The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but its the graphics, the atmosphere and most all the mere game play - which borders on the bizarre for some and is just pure fun for others - that makes this worth every $ I spend for it.

unwind, from, day, A very nice brain teaser to unwind from a hard day at work. I also love the second game
Finished, in, hour, Not worth the money. Finished in about an hour. Avoid
went, through, levels, I had a great challenge for when I had first went through all the levels
Finished, in, sitting, Beautiful and enjoyable but not terribly challenging and much too short. Finished in a sitting.
holds, As, game, As a puzzle game, it still holds plenty of wonderful designed levels that push the grey matter. Excellent graphics & superb musical accompaniment.
forget, about, stress, Never has a mobile game had me forget about all the daily stress until now. Beautiful experience, bravo!
▶, over, PLAY, WOW ! HATS OFF THE THE CREATOR'S OF THIS GORGEOUS MINDANDBODY OF WORK !! JUST AMAZINGLY DONE GREAT JOB I've Never wanted to leave a review but this game is one that Has to be recognized for it's geniusly done work it keeps the mind wondering and planning ahead .. great Time pass and over just a VERY GOOD PLAY ▶️
played, with, headphones, Tranquil and challenging This is a relaxing yet slightly challenging game. Best played with headphones. It's a few hours of fun. Fun to go back and play again after a few months.

play, after, stroke, Loads beautifully now on my S20 ultra I've had the monument Valley games since they came out the graphics are exemplary truly love these games had to relearn how to play again after my stroke and i believe these games have been helping me with everyday problem solving it took a while but I am definitely getting there i only wish you could make these games for the Nintendo switch i would definitely buy them again for that as well these games are magnificent big high 5 Devs well done 👏

rotating, in, minds, Wonderful game! I imagine the creators rotating streets and buildings in their minds trying to get around more efficiently.
engaging, for, stars, Too easy. Too expensive for what it is. Still it's engaging, fun, but too easy, too short and too expensive for what you get, hence the 3 stars. I do enjoy the coloring, gamelan and sound. It could be a bit harder and longer is all. 😂😂😂😂😂 cue the perverted.
pay, for, games, Simply brilliant. Simple and brilliant. I rarely pay for mobile games, but this and the follow up are great value for money.
invested, in, story, One of the better games I have played. The story is super good and the game makes you feel invested in the story which is written amazingly. All in all I think you should give it a try because in my opinion its on of the best games out there

look, To, Moon, Wanted another puzzle game but not another Room 🛋️. This is not too hard or long; nice ambient music 🎶. If you want a story look elsewhere e.g. To The Moon, Dr. Who's Lonely Assassins. Play Pass ▶️ makes this worth it with the bonus games and the sequel for no extra 💲. First month is free. *No they didn't pay me to say that. 😏
put, into, game, Really peaceful game, you can see the detail and love put into this game.
pay, for, game•, •It's so fun,And it's a game for all ages to enjoy but I'm very upset that you have to pay for the second game•
filled, with, conundrums, Meditative, non competitive, cooperative, no threats, no violence, just beautiful and filled with topological conundrums.
feel, after, while, Nice little game to while an afternoon away. 10 levels is just enough. Less and it wouldn't have been worth it. More and I would have gotten sick of it as thing do start to feel repetitive after a while. The graphics are very nice as is the music although, there again, things do start to sound repetitive after a few levels. Not a bad game though. Maybe I've just played too many of these kind of games over the years.

check, for, errors, Was playing this game and really love it already... got stuck & wasn't sure where 2 go next, and then had a good look round on app and seen products/merch on the app and went to check it out. Wouldn't let me click any products at all says click bit link didn't work & to check for spelling errors etc... would of loved them prints... they look so cool.. plz fix this..!!! X game maybe have a hint option also to help..?
take, for, anything, I am not a gamer, just a busy German Mother who does not take time for anything! But this game captured me, it's very detailed with the blowing skirt and dangling legs. I think the creators should get a reward for this outstanding game. Keep up the good work! I am intrigued by your skills! And that's the brutal truth!
PLAYED, IN, LIFE, BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!! This game is absolute total magic!!! I have never played or even seen a game like this!!! It's so amazing the way each puzzle comes together. Reminds me of the very beginning of Game Of Thrones with all the moving oragami that creates the GOT map of the cities. In this game every puzzle is brain food, it moves like magic with hidden slots & doorways that create absolute masterpieces for a little fairy to find her way thru.

mentioned, in, interview, loved this game. super beautiful and calming. Ariana Grande mentioned it in her Allure interview as an inspiration for her No Tears Left To Cry music video!

care, about, story, The game is such a fun puzzle game some levvles will stump you a bit but the music and grafics are awsome but the story to the game is kind of confusing but if you care about the story or not your still gonna have a great time.
frustrated, in, way, Very good game, puzzles are challenging but in an attainable and rewarding way, I never got frustrated. The visuals and soundtrack are beautiful. All in all a very well put together game well worth the price.
buy, by, developer, Such a lovely, relaxing yet mind bending game. I would buy any amount of similar games by this developer.
play, for, time, I cant believe I never reviewed this. I own both this and its sequel. They're stunning. No notes. I wish I could play them for the first time again.
tinkering, with, object, This game is peaceful yet thought provoking. If you like puzzles this is your type of game. It gives you the mental experience of tinkering around with a new mechanical object by playing with spacial awareness in a musical creative way.

play, on, inch, *Update* My original review included that I could not play this on my 14 inch 2 in 1 Chromebook. I figured out that you have to play it through Google Games and fold it to tablet "mode". worked fine and looks gorgeous on a large screen. It is a bit short. Played the extra level that you have to find in the menu. Will probably buy the extra levels. Love the music and parts of chapters had me stumped a bit but figured them out. Will probably play both games many times. A fun and relaxing game.

Reminds, of, Fez, Super innovative little gem. Reminds me of Fez. Like taking a walk in Escher's artwork. Short, to the point, no filler, doesn't get old, and until the very end introduces pleasent mind-breaking surprises. Nevertheless, I missed some more challenging levels that test your understanding of the mechanics.

played, on, mobile, One of the best games I have played on mobile.
resolved, in, hours, Enjoyed. Short game play, resolved all levels in just a couple hours but very much enjoyed.
working, in, phone, Played this game 3 years ago, but now in my phone this game is not working just black screen appear please solve my problem
passed, on, one, Beautiful game but far too short and unchallenging. I'd rate the difficulty suitable for age group 6 to 10 years old. I wish more developers would give a clue in the description as to what age group the game is intended for or have some sort of complexity rating... I would have passed on this one. Also, it says that progress is saved to pick up where you left off. That wasn't the case for me even registered with Google play, I had to begin a chapter from the beginning if I left the game.

get, to, goal, Love this relaxing game where you have to work out route to get the character to the goal
add, to, scam, Beware! This game is EXTREMELY SHORT!!! I feel like all the positive reviews just add to the scam that is this game.
played, through, times, Amazing puzzle game. Did hunter s. Thompson help develop? When do we get #3? Love, and have played through multiple times.
hoping, for, Monument, Best game ever, hoping for Monument 3
finished, in, minutes, I finished in 40 minutes. Really fun.
made, into, game, A masterpiece. The game devs took sacred geometry and made it into a beautiful, fun, surprising, and challenging game. The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the complexity of the puzzles is a winning combination. The mystical, fantastical elements made me smile. Can't wait to finish this and play Monument Valley 2!

rid, of, one, 1 star for deleting my review. Pay to get rid of this one again.
give, on, part, Very beautiful game, the puzzles are very creative but not so difficult that you give up. I did give up on one part of a puzzle and when I looked up the answer I felt so dumb because of how easy it was! Lovely story as well as graphics, well worth the purchase.
challenging, in, game, Beautiful and challenging in a relaxing way game. Definitely worth the money spent.
develop, like, this, Love this game! They need to develop more like this..
was, in, chapter, I just played the most horrible architectural puzzle game called Odie's dimension. Story text was off screen, horrible sensitivity, and in the third chapter there was a walking pattern to go through that was utterly ridiculous. As I'm playing the third chapter all I can think is "Man I need to re-download Monument Valley." I re-download Monument Valley and uninstall Odie's Dimension and I haven't even passed the second chapter and I want to worship the devs. Thanks for making such a great game😁

think, outside, box, This game was an unexpected surprise! I love puzzle games that make you think outside the box. Monument Valley definitely delivered in the most beautiful way! My only complaint is that I didn't want the game to end, but it did. Immediately bought MV2 and was not disappointed. I hope the devs continue this story!

bending, at, times, A beautiful work of interactive art. Visually mind bending at times but not difficult; it tricks you into thinking you're being smarter than you're ever really required to be.
DISSAPOINTED, Like, others, Very interesting and immersive concept. Flawless puzzles and encountered no glitches and bugs. Like many others, I am DISSAPOINTED. For a game with such a high rating, (4.8 / 5) I thought this game will be fullfilling. But you can easily finish this game in an hour and a half. I would liked it to be longer and harder like the IDA's Dream Chapter / Chapter 10 as I breezed through all the puzzles. I appreciate the quality > quantity but this game would be 10x better if it had quality AND quantity

PAY, TO, WAY, I wish I could tell you how much I loved playing this game not only one but TWO IT WAS AMAZING AND SMOOTH AND YES I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE WAY IT MOVES 👍👍👍 IS THERE ANYMORE COMING OUT SOON??
challenging, at, parts, Beautiful game and the puzzles are challenging at some parts. It was amazing. Great job.
look, at, perspectives, Loved this game, helps you look at different perspectives. It's interesting as well, ended too soon though. I remember getting this game for free, was one of the lucky ones xd
come, on, developers, Flawless in every detail, however, there must be an easier way to leave the game. There is no exit button anywhere. How does one leave the game? Please add one. Update 1: 12/9/20 Please find an easier way to leave the game. Perhaps in the next update? Update 2: (25/11/20) Still no exit button. Update 3: (24/5/21) Incredibly, still no exit button. Why make leaving the app so complicated? Update 4: Still no exit button !! (23/6/21). Update #5: Still no exit button--come on developers !! (10/7/21).
add, to, library, Why is it not possible to add this to my family library?
look, at, walk, Loved it! It's on my YouTube, Aelaofalba Its a beautiful game with such unique puzzles, one or two I even had to cheat on and look at a walk through because they just get harder as you go on. Nevertheless it was really fun and a pleasure to play such beautiful artwork. Can't wait for the 2nd one.

grew, with, father, Beautiful game. Interesting, challenging but not so much that it pisses you off. It's very meditative and it's easy to lose track of time while playing. I grew up with a father who loves MC Escher and had multiple prints in our home. I would stare at those as a child wondering where each door lead and wondering what it would be like to be IN those drawings. This game gives you that ability. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

paying, for, game, I guess paying 4 dollars for a short game isn't really worth it if you're going to make us pay for an extra 8 chapters

beat, between, dinner, Seriously? 4.99 for a game I beat between dinner and bed time. If there were about 50 more levels it would be worth it....but 10. Rip off.
say, on, price, Stunning graphics, and the soundtrack is perfect. Got it for free with Google Play Pass so cant say much on price, recommended no matter what.
makes, for, it, I absolutely loved everything about this game. The graphics, the sound and character design, the puzzles, the story... It's a bit of a shame the game is pretty quick to finish playing, but I'm not complaining, everything else definitely makes up for it
fascinates, in, sleep, Brilliant. Soundtrack gives me chills crawling down my entire body and the beautiful appearance and genius geometric puzzle design fascinates me in my sleep. Definitely worth those two caps, maybe three if you feel like getting yourself the dlc which lets you continue your epic journey and may be even better than the game alone!
play, for, nights, It was brilliant, but it was over too soon. relaxing game, was very well made then it was over!!.i had stupidly assumed that i could play it for a few nights at least. dissapointing. I cant see how one plays it again as there is only one way to solve each puzzle. I prefere a game that i can play for longer than an hour. But its still well made and beautiful and worth buying. Just dont expect to be playing it for long and you wont be dissapointed by it. Its truly beautiful.

Finished, in, days, I loved it. It was fairly easy though for me atleast. Finished it in 3 days with 25-40 minutes of gameplay each day!

need, on, play, THIS is precisely the sort of game that we need on Google play... and not just because it is gorgeous, polished to perfection and immersive. You pay upfront very little money for an amazing game... and (big surprise) you actually don't regret spending money on google play!!! In fact you feel really good about what you paid for as being super worth it even if it were double or triple the cost. What a concept, huh?

beat, in, hour, While game is phenomenal it is definitely not worth the price. I beat it in an hour and is very easy. This is worth 2$ max
listen, to, it, Amazing game! Where do I even begin? The soundtrack is incredible, and I can listen to it for hours. The animations are smooth as hell, and I love them. The puzzles are intriguing and every one is better than it's predecessor. This game is worth every penny, and is suitable for pretty much every age (I'd say 7+, because the puzzles may be a bit hard on younger children).

Thank, for, fun, My favorite apps!! These are so delightful! Thank you for all the fun! Please make more....😊
opening, to, up, Excellent game, 1 problem, both games (Mon 1 and this one) offline opening the game my license is not recognized I have to hook-up to get it to open, stealers. Short game but actually good for replaying.
attached, to, box, Absolutely beautiful game with highly creative geometric mechanics. The music is top notch and the lack of it in certain levels proved a very powerful atmosphere. Some of the screenshots from this game are my wallpapers right now. P.s. I never thought I would get emotionally attached to a yellow semi-conscious box.
go, through, them, This game is really fun but way too short for the price. The interface is cool but not the most practical I felt. It was difficult to view each of the levels and required a lot of effort to go through them all. The gameplay is really well done and extremely fun but too little for the price
Storytelling, before, Souls, This game if an amazing example of a certain type of storytelling. With limited dialog and a long journey, it was Dark Soul as Storytelling before Dark Souls was a thing. I only with there was more of it.
progressing, through, kind, Fantastic puzzle game with great aesthetics. The story for the game is a bit more abstract but you feel like ur progressing through some kind of narrative. The character models are cute too. Perfect mobile game, lots of short levels with easy pickup and play
done, after, that, I love this game. It certainly has a number of cognitive benefits. I was very excited to purchase the "no ad" version because the ads were very disruptive; but I still receive an annoying number ads. I was charged abt $1.00 more than advertised. Also, you are only allowed to play the game a few times per day. It will let you watch an ad to get another turn; but after that, you're done for the day. That's not exactly what I had in mind when I bought the game. Otherwise, would have rated 5 stars.

took, With, levels, I really loved the game but for the price it was way too short and the puzzles are pretty easy. With only 10 levels, it only took me an hour or so to finish.
complete, in, life, Monument Valley is an amazing game. A brilliant experience that everyone should attempt to complete at least once in their life. The graphics, sounds and games are brilliant and I loved every minute of it. I wish there was a Monument Valley 3, 4 and 5.
pay, for, amount, This is such a cute little game. I could sit and play these all day every day. I don't know that I would pay for the little amount there is to do, but if there was a daily puzzle or a lot more chapters I would for sure pay a small one time fee.
play, to, finish, It was simple. So simple. And yet I couldn't stop. Not until the end. The very, very end. The only mobile game I've ever played and felt so compelled to play to finish. 10/10
played, for, Makin, That was the best game I ve ever played thanks for Makin it good and I will definitely buy the second version ❤❤
played, through, game, I played this game when I was 8 and it was amazing. 6 years later and I still love it just as much, I've played through the entire game multiple times now and it has never stopped being a challenge. I'm absolutely in love with the designs of the characters as well as the levels themselves and appreciate the way the game makes you really have to think.
think, in, ways, Beautiful game. Beautiful mechanics. Artwork is amazing. Will make you think in ways you probably never have before in order to solve the puzzle.

puts, to, rest, It's a fun game and really puts your imagination to the rest! I used to play this a long time ago but just recently re-downloaded it. Once you get the gist of it you can go through it quickly, but the fact that there are different levels with different difficulties is really great!

fall, in, love, Beautiful MC Escher Style Game - the ingenuity is absolutely incredible. I love this game so much that I framed and put up 3 of the prints in my daughter's nursery 4 years ago. Anyone that has a love of geometrical architecture will also fall in love.
play, with, me, Very enjoyable, not crazy difficult, my 6 year old likes to play along with me.
has, to, it, Where do I begin?! This game is absolutely phenomenal. Each level has its own unique characteristics and charm to it. The idea of manipulating environments built upon impossible architecture is amazing. The entire game has this mysterious and mesmerising, whilst also calming atmosphere. The OST, with its ambiance and mystery really complements everything else. This strange world is my home away from home. On top of all this, there's a captivating and engaging story! A brilliant gem! 100/100!! 🙂

finish, in, hours, A very fun game but also very short. You can finish it in a few hours.
challenging, for, me, Amazing game idea with great minimalistic graphics, but for me the puzzles aren't challenging enough and that wouldn't be a problem if I didn't pay 5$ for a game I completed in under 2h... I had way more hours of fun with games half as expensive so here are 4* :/

beat, in, days, Very much enjoy this game so much i beat it in 2 days
make, with, dlcs, An Awesome indie game you actually have to make part 3 it's so awesome a creative game and some much of thinking in my opinion in this 3D world liked the idea and the gameplay I'm actually a fan of this series right now i hope you make part 3 soon with more dlcs and levels and continue making games like this and more series you actually can do it
based, on, illusion, Such a cool idea to build a game based on an optical illusion, and it's so much fun! Perfect level of difficulty all the way through, including Forgotten Shores. I can't even imagine conceptualizing and designing the levels; it must've been a huge challenge to make this game. I also love the atmosphere, the music, and the sound design. Looking forward to playing the second one.
relaxing, for, people, Love this game. Epic! Amazing consept and utilization of game dynamics. Highly addictive and relaxing for people who love puzzle games. One of the few games that I can play over and over again without losing an appreciation for its creativity, flow, and design. Simply put: beautiful. A work of art. Worth every penny.

play, during, flight, The game is really great, but watch out - in case you want to play it during a flight, don't forget to launch the app before! I used the app only less than a week ago, and then when I opened it while in plane mode it tried to validate the license and failed due to the lack of connectivity. Very frustrating.

impressed, with, mechanics, Mind Blowing Reality Bending Puzzles. There has never been a mobile game that has ever impressed me with its mechanics and graphics.
beat, in, hours, Game is pretty sweet no doubt about it. But it's way to short to be 5 bucks. You can beat the game in a few hours or less
Look, to, more, Awesome gameplay, very creative levels,good challenges! Look forward to more from these guys :)
played, on, time, The best puzzle game I've played on a long time. Stunning graphics and optical illusions!
got, into, game, Enchanting. My granddaughter Olivia got me into this game; as she knew I would appreciate the beauty of the graphics; especially being a huge admirer of fine architecture and sacred geometry. Beautifully immersive and Zen like; it has the magic of feeling led into wondrous corridors of psychological significance.

think, in, which, I enjoyed the way in which you must think three dimensionally. I was disappointed when I completed all levels only because I wanted to keep playing.
playing, on, tablet, I enjoyed this game. Challenging, and the music is nice. Finished it too soon though. Also finished the side story and the second game. Saw my five year old playing it on her tablet, and she was enjoying the challenge.
Played, on, Pass, Played on Play Pass. Excellent puzzle game and beautiful visuals. Love the Escher inspired puzzles. Recommended.
fell, in, love, LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME!!❤️⭐❤️ This game is the sole reason I'm playing games again. The 3D puzzle game play blew me away! I fell in love with the storyline, the art the mechanic's of the game. It looks so easy yet it's really NOT! LoL can't recommend enough!❤️⭐❤️
pay, for, game, The game is truly incredible. It is a really immersive, challenging but rewarding game. Music is wonderful and it's very relaxing. Gave 4 stars because it's just kind of weird to pay $5 for a game that you can completely finish in one sitting.

make, for, it, I had downloaded and finished this game over 2 years ago and came back to find it because I loved it so much. Definitely a stand out game with gorgeous graphics and audio. The storyline is a little lackluster but the landscapes really make up for it. Loved this.
find, at, time, Rare to find a game this esthetically beautiful plus meaningful at the same time. I truly enjoyed playing this game, from Ida's complex journey and the lessons she (and the player) can learn from it is amazing. The levels are far from easy but very logically challenging. Highly recommend!

detailed, with, puzzles, I enjoyed this game. It was beautifully detailed with very perplexing puzzles. Often it was a matter of stopping and coming back to see what I had missed that was right in front of me. The storyline was engaging and the controls were fairly straightforward to use. I appreciate the effort put into this game by the developers.

add, on, levels, Amazing!!!!! Unique and brilliant (both this ages ago, and also like to replay it and the bonus add on levels. Can't recommend it highly enough.
do, with, levels, Pretty excellent. Could do with a few more levels.
beat, in, day, Although very fun and a little challenging, I thought there would be more than 10 levels for a paid app. I beat the game in a day. Now what?!
completed, in, time, Enjoyable! I completed the game in two days time including the dlc and the side story with a total of about 1 1/2hrs to 2hrs. Then I played MV2 and completed that in a day. This is one great franchise to continue on with, I will be looking forward to seeing MV 3, 4 and so on... I'm ready for a storyline with twins searching for each other as they use the elements. You could introduce an app where we could create levels that could be playable by others with each new game that's released.

went, to, orange, This game is one of the most frustrating game I have ever played. so i was on level eight I went to the orange one with the kid. I went in a door then I couldn't get out and I couldn't beat the level so I had to redownload it then it crashes one of the worst games ever

pushed, to, game, Art and music are great. The rest, meh. I was pushed to this game because it has good story and puzzling. While those elements exist, they are somewhat bland. But the artistic styling and music is amazing!
think, outside, box, A really fun puzzle game that forces you to think outside the box, though it's not annoyingly difficult. The main portion of the game can be completed within a couple of hours if you play straight through. There's also a bonus set of levels you can purchase for about half the price of the main game, and it's just as enjoyable. The way the moveable objects in the game produce musical notes of various instruments is clever and adds to the enjoyment. The background music is also very calming.

sort, for, video, (SPOILER kind of) This game is a brilliant example of story telling and puzzle. I initally sort this game out for a YouTube video, and was only gonna play the first 5 levels. But I got hooked, and decided to complete it (and get 2 videos out of it). The ending was nice, after level 9 when the little girl put the flower down. This game is bitter sweet. On top of that, I have the DLC to play and the standalone adventure. Thank you for a brilliant brilliant game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.

playing, for, periods, I loved the storyline and the art, and the levels weren't super frustrating, so it kept me playing for very long periods of time. It kept the story moving, and it provided a nice balance between full enjoying the storytelling, soundtrack, and gameplay.
based, on, perspective, A very enjoyable game for me at 59 and my Grandkids at 5 and 6. I've always liked M. C. Escher, it's really cool to see a game based on his perspective bending art. The ethereal music is a perfect fit to the game. The story line is also interesting with its focus on redemption.
made, because, inventiveness, This game actually made me smile because of its inventiveness, but don't expect a head-scratching kind of puzzler; this is more like an endearing journey with puzzle mechanics. But it's cool.
used, in, Curriculum, This game should be used in the Curriculum of Army training programs for LEADERSHIP purposes and DECISIONMAKING.

fulfilling, in, nature, Beautiful geometric puzzles. Simplistic gameplay, but fulfilling in its nature. Only thing lacking is its length. More levels would be awesome! Thumbs up from me! Great little game devs!

theank, about, puzzles, The game in reaily very good . I enjoyed every second of the gameplay but the game is too short it took me only 1 or 1.5 hour to finish the game it would be more fun if the gameplay gets more harder and i could spend more time to theank about those puzzles......thanks to the developers.....🥰🥰
passed, by, times, Is it art or is it a game? Well, its actually both. I'm an audiophile who loves puzzles and a life long fan of Escher. Someone actually made a game for me! I think the ONLY thing I would change is the icon. It really doesn't give any clue to the amazement that lurks within. I passed the game by a few times as the icon looked kinda dull. Amazing game deserves an amazingly instantly recognizable brand icon! One of the best games I've ever played, ever! 10/10
play, for, ages, If you like Escher paintings and labrynths, then this is the game for you! Very aesthetically pleasing, mind stimulating, and easy to play for all ages. As a math teacher id encourage even my students to play this game for its geometric ingenuity. Much worth the few $ for purchase.

get, after, while, Pro: So beautiful in graphic design and music Con: Can get a little repetitive after a while
felt, With, exception, This is a great game, but unfortunately, as someone with experience with non-euclidean and perspective based puzzle games (Portal, Superliminal, and Light Matter) the majority of the levels were very easy. With the exception of the final level in both the base game and paid DLC, and the Citadel of Deceit (which I particularly enjoyed), no other levels felt even remotely challenging
made, in, future, Great app, each level is puzzling as it says and the storyline was amazing. Hope more games like this are made in rhe future
lasted, for, years, Absolutely gorgeous and moving, it left an impression on me that's lasted for years.
get, through, them, While I enjoyed the game it is way, way too short for a game that costs $6. It has only 10 levels and while they are very pretty they are not overly challenging so you get through them very quickly. Disappointing.
price, for, amount, No ads, Beautiful imaginative and relaxing puzzles. Not sure at it is worth he price for the amount of game play. It Can be done in a few hours. But worth the price not to have the flow of the game interrupted.

played, through, times, Probably my favorite game of all time on a mobile phone. I've played through several times and it never gets old for me. Beautifully designed 10/10, highly recommend
live, in, Valley, this is the game that started me loving games. every time I replay it, it's such an experience. I would live in Monument Valley if I could
finished, in, seating, it's a very beautiful game, was disappointed that it's only 10 levels, specially that it's not a free game. i finished it in one seating, i wish it could've been at least 20 levels.
find, on, Spotify, Simply beautiful! Mind-bending gameplay; very pleasing visuals; and a soundtrack you have to go and find on Spotify to listen to again!
loves, with, me, Noone loves it with me only she ina he could betray such a curley sue cc
completed, in, days, It's a good game but I completed it in a few days and now I'm bored. And I can't go any further because you have to buy everything
rated, under, star, Not sure how it can be rated under 5 star. Perfect game for your phone. 1-3 minute puzzles to waste a little time.
obsessed, with, game, I have never been a "gamer". Played a few puzzle games in the past but I am totally obsessed with this game. Incredibly immersive. You won't want to put it down. I was constantly amazed at the imagination that went into all of the different challenges. Can't even wrap my head around it! Believe me, you definitely want to play this game. I can't wait to start Monument Valley 2

got, after, couple, This is a visually beautiful game but after a couple of times playing it I got slightly bored.
die, in, minecraft, This is one of the most soothing games I have ever played. Everytime I die in minecraft, (or some other video game) and rage quit, I'd play this game. Its so calming and beautiful 😍 😌
bring, to, life, This is a truly beautiful and ingenious game. The narrative is simple but warm. Some of the levels can be a little linear but they're so well designed it's hard not to appreciate. Its simple yet vibrant aesthetic and mind bending architecture bring the world to life. I just wish there was more of it. Edit: There's now more of it 5*
loved, for, challenge, Loved the game, beautiful music and presentation and the core perspective based mechanic is cool. Would have loved for more challenge at certain points and also for it to be longer given its price
played, on, psp, This is fantastic! It reminded me a lot of a game I played on psp back in the day called Echo. I really loved the graphics and the sound design! Worth a play!!
feels, like, box, A beautiful game, it almost feels like an interactive music box. Not much left to surprise you when you already know the solutions but it's a fun stress reliever to replay
played, on, android, Best game I've played on android. It's subtle, stylish and has a lot of substance. Some of the best level design I've ever seen and easily one of the best puzzle games of all time without doubt. It does exactly what it sets out to do and does it perfectly
worked, for, masterpiece, Outstanding and peaceful game. I can't imagine how hard the team worked for such a masterpiece Thanks.

played, for, minutes, THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME! I've only played this for like 10 to 20 minutes and it's already super relaxing and cool!
tried, during, trial, Great fun. Keeps you thinking but isn't difficult. I tried this game during a free trial of Google Play Pass so I did not purchase it. It was free with Play Pass. If I had purchased this game I would've been disappointed that I finished it in one day. I also download MV2, again it was included in Play Pass so no purchase required. The second version was even better but it was over just as quickly as the first.

challenges, at, times, Brilliant game that really challenges your perception at times
recommend, to, everyone, I love the story and the art Would highly recommend to everyone who has free time over a long weekend to get worth every cent I paid

Finished, in, sitting, Beautiful animations, good puzzles and lovely music. Only downside is that it's really short. Finished it in one sitting.
recommend, to, anyone, Some easy levels are really difficult and some harder levels are easy great storyline simple graphics definitely recommend to anyone who likes problem solving.
paying, for, Pass, Not too long. Difficulty is just right. Beautiful visual and audio. This is one of the games that make paying for the Play Pass worth it. Worth buying as well though.
played, with, old, I played it with my 8 year old and she loved it
captivating, with, graphics, Edited to add that i re downloaded the games and am playing them again. So enjoyable and wish the creators would continue the "series". Beautiful. ❤️ I absolutely loved this and Monument Valley 2. Wonderfully captivating with it's smooth graphics, brilliant illusionary puzzles and dreamlike story. I hope the developers continue the MV games.
described, to, friends, This is beautiful and intriguing game. The art and music are gorgeous and the puzzles and illusions are absolutely enchanting. I've described it to friends like a book of poetry, each new level feeling like another poem.

WAIT, FOR, MORE, I played until I couldn't play anymore. GREAT JOB, AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE
played, in, time, Honestly the prettiest game I've ever played in a long time
feels, like, puzzles, Absolutely one of the best! Beautiful graphics, sound design, and what feels like very natural puzzles that are fun and reasonable instead of frustrating and ridiculous. One of the few mobile games I look forward too tapping open.
Goin, up, stairs, Goin up the stairs and goin down the stairs and goin up the sideways stairs! This game reminds me of Fez, minus the frustration and confusion. Best mobile game I've played, by a mile!

ask, for, money, I had fun BUTTTTT, there are only 10 levels witg 1 or 2 "DLC's". So not worth the money, and then ask for more money to play monument valley 2? Finished the whole thing is 1 night which is sad
think, for, 4, Amazing game, but for $4 or $5, I would think there would be more than 10 levels!!! Finished the game in less than 24 hours. Sad.

played, besides, cod, The best game I have ever played besides cod and terraria
finished, in, hour, I was REALLY enjoying this game. Good satisfying puzzles (not too easy, not too frustrating either), visually dynamic, soothing music, etc. But then it was over. I finished the WHOLE game in just over an hour. I know there is a second version now, but I don't think its worth the money for such short play time. Amazing game, but it's disappointingly short.
messed, with, mind, Very Fun and interesting game. I highly recommend buying it. It really messed with your mind and sucks you in. Really good time burner but also is a puzzle game at the same time. 👌
forced, like, pace, Nice puzzler. I especially like the slow pace and atmospheric music, it kind of forced me to relax, plan my movements and then execute. Sort of a mindfulness app really. Great job devs!
playing, through, levels, Beautiful and enjoyable puzzles, super smooth. I love sitting and playing through all the levels. I also played Ida's Dream, which was free, and it had been developed for a charity and they suggested making a donation, so I went and donated to a local shelter. I love the games even more that they suggest a donation rather than paying for those few levels!

Got, through, it, Good but extremely short. Got through it maybe in less than an hour. Since head scratchers but overall very easy. Was hoping for something like "the room" series level of difficulty. It's a well made game, but really should be twice as long for the price.

brought, to, tears, Never thought it possible, but the beauty of this game brought me to tears !!! KUDOS TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM !!!! \♡/
benefits, from, interface, One of the truly great mobile games that actually benefits from a touch interface and pick up and play model. To say nothing of the strong visual design and approachable level of difficulty. Elegant and delightful.
executed, in, detail, Optically pleasing, meticulously created artwork. The music and sound effects are carefully selected and executed in detail. The mind-bending optical illusion, making use of the "impossible" geometry is a true innovation in gaming (at least in mobile gaming as much as I am aware of). In short, a true gem in mobile gaming and, in fact, a piece of art.
played, in, bed, Wow! Beautiful game. I played every night per level in my bed before shutting my eyes to sleep. It took about 1 week journey to complete. It was easy at first then it got more challenging. I have no idea how my mind figures the puzzle when I was about to give up...then 💥 💥 💥 conscious took over and the puzzle connected for that level. I really have great fun with this purchase game. Please keep up the great work. Going to make another purchased and continue the magical experience ✨ 😌.

click, on, it, I bought it, but it says I still need to buy it, even though when I click on it it says already owned
think, in, dimensions, Nice diversion and makes one think in three dimensions. I like the music but generally turn off so not to bother other people.
look, into, it, Loved the game, both 1 and 2! Guys, check out the game "Odie's Dimension", you might want to look into it since it's a rip-off of your game.
aspire, to, what, This level of quality is what every mobile game should aspire to.
leave, for, game, I will always leave space for this game.
finish, in, minutes, This an amazing game i even finish the game in just 10 minutes a day I WANT IN THE NEXT UPDATE ADD MORE CHAPTERS. I cant stop playing monument valley 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

found, in, level, Beautiful, fun, calming, sometimes emotional. An amazing example of how great a mobile game can be. I've almost finished the Forgotten Shores expansion, will probably get Ida's dream too. Only found 1 bug so far, in the Waterfall level.
enchanting, At, times, Beautiful. Delightful. At times even enchanting.
go, on, sale, Beatiful, but very short... not very challenging either. Wait for it to go on sale, or you may wind up being disappointed as I was.
expecting, for, price, It's a very cool, visually stunning game that keeps your brain working. However, for the price, I was expecting more content. Finished in probably ~2hrs total play time.
turning, of, objects, Puzzles are pretty easy. Mostly all turning of objects in your mind to see new connections. Some remembering of how to use optical illusions to your advantage. I enjoy this sort of thing for casual entertainment.

limit, to, ten, I love this game so much. Please add more levels, don't limit it to ten. I've played it four times and it's getting boring. I do notice difference but would love for the story to keep continuing so I can master new levels

is, of, story, Really enjoyed this - very relaxing and clever, though if you are used to puzzle games of any sort you'll find this far too easy. Only gets 5 stars for the add on pack which is an extra £1.50. The main game on it's own is good but it's short and finishes just as it seems to be going somewhere interesting. The add on is much more interesting, to me anyway. What there is of the 'story' is pretentious nonsense!
cried, over, totem, So beautiful. Loved how it made me think. Almost cried over the totem. Relaxing at the same time it is engaging.

thinking, outside, box, This game is a pure happiness and joy for those who love geometry, thinking outside the box, beautiful visuals and fantasy.
drive, due, puzzles, Brilliant. Definitely very challenging and keeps you thinking, so if you don't want a boring game this is not boring. Might drive you nuts sometimes due to the complex puzzles, but it's worth continuing to the end to see the outcomes & the gorgeous graphics (the optical illusion artist M.C. Escher would love both games if he were still alive) and colors. I am going to post the next game, now.

playing, through, content, Great sound and visuals. Captivating puzzles. After playing through all the content my only complaint is that there isn't more of it. Eagerly looking forward to MV2.

play, in, mobile, Is one of the best games that I have play in mobile in this year. Every thing is great, the story, the design of each level, the music the way of playing. Thanks so much to all the team of developers looking forward for more games of you.

quit, in, all, I love this game it has a great story line and the art is amazing the way you move around and the characters you meet are awesome the puzzles and monuments are hard but not to hard that you would quit all in all it is the best game you can get on the play store. I love it and I think you would to.

buying, for, price, Basically this game is more than awesome. The graphics are wonderful and the story too. BUT... buying this game for that price I imagined several hours of gaming. But you can finish this game pretty fast.
bored, with, it, It is a great game but when you are finished and bored with it it is sad that you can't get your money back though
addicted, to, them, So impressed! I was very skeptical of this game at first, didnt think it'd be something I liked, boy was I WRONG, THIS GAME IS SUPER FUN AND INTRIGUING!! Just downloaded 2 and can't wait to start playing it now. I hope yall develop more so I can get addicted to them as well!!!
wait, for, second, Love! I love this game, I played the first one and couldnt wait for a second! Now ive played all the levels and 1 again I really, really, really hope they bring out a 3rd. Woukd defo buy! Again!
buy, for, hour, Good enough to buy for a hour or two of gameplay. Great music and character. Puzzle is cool.
gone, into, game, This game is has the most amazing graphics and storyline , I definitely recommend it!!! You can really tell how much work has gone into the game . The same goes for monument Vally 2 , and I might even like it more . The way it combines beautifully illustrations , a amazing storyline and interesting challenges is outstanding. It's definitely worth the price!!!!!!!! :)

using, for, platforms, Unique, amazing, and fun game. Only issue really was that the controls were little wonky when using the spinners for platforms, or whole puzzle, etc. Would over shoot or under shoot there objective point a lot. Hopefully we will see a monument 3 or something similar soon.
according, to, game, I just played first game so according to this, very best game in mobile. If there will be a game that take the first place, It would be just second game of this. Very best.
have, with, it, The game is absolutely gorgeous, relaxing and mesmerising, all of that is true. That being said, it offers close to no challenge and is rather short. It is not a bad game but it is more of an experience than it is a game in the strictest sense of the term. As long as you're aware of what you're buying you'll probably have a good time with it though.
created, for, play, It's a neat pocket experience with nice visuals and puzzles created for mobile play in mind.

recommend, for, anyone, A really well done non-euclidean game. I wish I could give it 5 stars because it was beautiful and extremely creative in it's game development and design (bravo devs). However, it was really short. Took under an hour to complete all content. The other downside to this game is that it was not challenging. I would recommend it for anyone looking for laid back puzzles and a cool non-euclidean game design despite the downsides. Not worth the price to me but I don't regret the purchase either.

got, through, thing, I can't believe how short this game was. It's beautiful but I got through the whole thing in an hour. Very disappointing that there weren't more levels (and harder levels) for $4.

manipulate, to, points, This is an exceptionally amazing game! The solutions to the puzzles seem impossible at first, but are so seeming right there as you walk your path and manipulate the path to different view points. How some of them came together had me say "Wow, that's amazing!" on more than one occasion. This game makes your brain have to think outside of the box. One of the greatest games I've ever played. Will absolutely be looking at the developer's other titles. Brilliantly done guys and gals!

wander, in, world, I am delighted with this game. I got to wander in a world like that created by Escher solving puzzles that would make my eyes cross. I really like the game.
use, for, logic, This game is so enjoyable and relaxing. I'm actually letting my kids use this for both logic and reasoning and as part of pur MC Escher module.
pay, for, what, By far the best optical illusion game I've ever played. Edit: To those people who rated this game 1 star because they had to pay money to play, it's a premium game. Most good games are pay to play. This is a great game, and if you have to pay, just pay. It's 5 bucks and you get what you pay for. It cost extra to play new levels because they updated it, just like how you still have to pay for DLC's, even if you already bought the game. You're paying extra, for additional content.

short, for, price, Game is beautiful, but by far to short for the price
played, for, hour, It is fantastic but too little, i played it for 1 hour and it is done. I have paid 3$ for 1 hour of playing. So sad
think, outside, box, Great Game, love the way it forces you to think outside the box
contributed, to, creation, A beautiful & thoughtful game. Gentle story with wonderful imagery. Lovely music that compliments each chapter. The puzzles really make you think, but no pressure or stress. Take as much time as you like to complete and savour each level. I didn't want it to end. Well done artists and musicians and all who contributed to the creation of this gem of a game. 🌟
went, through, game, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME! It was extremely challenging for me because I tend not to pay attention like I should. Some of the solutions made me groan because I spent so long ignoring the obvious. I went through the whole game in less than a week and am currently downloading the second! Keep it coming!

travel, through, desert, Beautiful game on all levels - graphics, colors and sound. I like princess interaction with crows! The game was very meditative and overall it was like a gasp of crispy fresh air in oasis after long travel through the desert. The 19th level gave me run for the money, I even restarted the level, because thought I have missed something. Lol About some people complaints about price - it's much cheaper what you spend to go to movie theater to find out that movie was crappy. Thank you for the game!

Lol About some people complaints about price - it's much cheaper what you spend to go to movie theater to find out that movie was crappy. Thank you for the game!

play, as, treat, A lovely, and beautifully designed game. I found myself saving leveles to play as a treat. DOWNLOAD THIS!
finished, in, days, Great follow on to the first monument valley game, but unfortunately because I am so good at the mind games I finished them both in 2 days ... 1 day for first and 1 day for second ... Wud definitely recommend playing tho ... Good mind game
was, for, $, Having played, I would say there's enough content for maybe $2. More like $1.50. However, the music and interactions are quite enjoyable, and I do wish there was more for less $!!
put, Unlike, nothing, Unlike nothing I've come across before, very intelligently put together I love it.
engages, after, day, Very relaxing, almost therapeutic. And I like how it engages my brain especially after a long day of brain dead job.
made, through, labor, Clean, thoughtful and sacred. This is a sweet little game with a bit of general spirituality to it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and think the developers made this through a labor of love. Really well made, and part 2 is just as good, if not better. Thanks for making this game!
donate, to, someone, I dont know how to express my feelings,my whole experience playing this game,the ending,tiny messages like donate to someone worthy & close to you, the whole storyline,I just love your works,please release more of these if possible not paid
play, on, it, Incredible! The graphics are so beautiful and the storyline is great too. You can let little kids just play around on it, and its really challenging for adults as well. It really is a game that anyone could play and enjoy.

found, in, awe, A beautiful graphic dimensional game, each level is so creative and visually stunning that I found myself just in awe. A wonderful concept with a heart warming story line of finding your way in the world. This game really pushed the way you see things and should look at everything with a different perspective. Wish there were more of these games.
