gave, due, errors, Previously gave it a one star due to technical errors on my side. However after playing the game I have cummed my pants not once but a minimum of seven times. Would play again.

Love, to, death, Love it to death and yes i made a pun
piles, on, u, It was fun but it kinda piles things on u
rate, during, tutorial, Asked me to rate during tutorial.
forced, to, it, Fun to play and when you try to go fast or when you are forced to it gets challenging
had, for, one, I don't usually rate games but I had to for this one. It's one of the best mobile games I've played in a long time and I couldn't stop playing it until I beat it. DEFINETLY would recommend!

go, to, heaven, An ok daft timewasting game. You have to decide whether someone should go to heaven or hell (or later purgatory) based on their characteristics. Basically a new characteristic gets added per level. You get points for different horsemen of the apocalypse but it wasn't clear what the point of that is

selected, at, time, EDIT: Yeah lol that review was really old so I'm redoing it. I had indeed selected the incorrect save slot at the time, I'm just a dumbass lmao xD Excellent game, no complaints, full stars! The gameplay is simple yet challenging and the humor in the game is really well done for the most part. Only complaint is it's not made explicitly clear that the horseman's points are bad and you want as few as possible, but that's a minor thing and really no big deal. Well worth the price!! :D

save, to, cloud, Doesn't save to cloud
have, with, game, The only problem I have with this game is in later levels the ways to determine if you send a person to heaven, hell, or Purgatory become very contradictory and I can't tell who goes where or what the heck is going on and it gets very difficult to progress because of this.

loved, like, papers, Great concept, like papers please except more fast paced, loved it! I also loved the Dying Light reference
helped, with, adhd, I loved it, it really helped with my adhd
Needs, in, calls, Needs fixes in phone calls
put, into, game, Peace, Death! is not a bad game, but it isn't a good one, either. The graphics are pretty good, though, and the gameplay can be somewhat fun, but it gets boring very quickly. Still, I can definitely appreciate the effort that the developers put into the game.
pay, to, details, Fun and entertaining! You really have to pay attention to details
Takes, to, long, Takes to long to start. Uninstalled.
add, to, charm, Surprisingly addictive! The pixelated graphics & cheesy character lines add to the charm. Difficulty increases at a good rate. Highly recommend.

pay, to, person, You have to pay really closely attention to every person. Miss one thing you lose a life on a elevator but one really obvious thing makes you lose. Every game there is something new to find. 5 out of 5 game

ruin, for, me, If you like Papers, Please this is probably a game you'll enjoy. Not as story-driven and immensely more silly. The major complaint I have is the cages that appear 99% of the time in endless mode, which singlehandedly ruin the experience for me. Once in a great while, you randomly get to play without them and the game is infinitely better. They should do away with them completely.

worked, up, text, Fun game. The language needs some work. Reads like a translator app worked up the text.
kill, in, plane, A great simple game to kill time in a train plane or automobile.
reminds, of, papers, This game is really fun, it reminds me of papers, please and that's what I like about it. It can get tricky if you go too fast but overall it's fun and a great time killer.

hide, from, me, You can't hide your blood stains from me. To HELL!
distinguishing, on, feet, Honestly great time killer but one issue I've found so far is distinguishing blood on the individuals feet and blood under the feet to similar and makes it tough to choose. Really should distinguish it more.
looking, for, alternative, Been looking for an alternative to "Papers Please" for a phone and found something even a little better. Probably my favourite game for a phone.

Keeps, on, toes, Pretty fun game!!! Keeps me on my toesüòÅ
play, on, phone, Game is good, but it's not comfortable to play on phone.
gets, with, day, This is such a fun game, I've been playing every now and then this past month and it's so fun, the strategy in the game gets harder and harder with each day and I can't describe how good it is so just get it
made, to, play, Terribly slow to start, never made it to game play
go, To, hell, To hell and back we go
compared, to, some, Very cheap compared to some of the games I've played, plus with how long the story is and how it's constantly introducing new features, it's definitely worth the $2 (USD)!
gets, at, end, It is confusing at first but it gets better at the end
means, in, level, Game's fine, though the UI is confusing. Takes a while to work out exactly where to tap to do some things, and the effects of a selection aren't always self explanatory. For example, the 'influence' of the horsemen isn't well explained, and while 'more work' probably means more clients in the next level, is that permanent?
sounds, for, me, First of all, this game is fantastic. Amazing time waster when you're bored, it's fun, gameplay is smooth. I have encountered a bug though, because for me the audio always sounds slightly behind. You know? Like when youtube bugs out and the audio is always slightly behind what's going on in the video. Other than that, zero issues whatsoever, would give it 5 stars but the bug makes it a little irritating sometimes.

focused, on, recognition, A surprisingly good game focused on pattern recognition and discerning differences as well as holding a multitude of rules in your head. I'm using in jokes a short and tight gameplay loop and a overarching narrative framing all make it a fun time waster

gets, after, minutes, Fun but gets boring after 30 minutes, and there isn't any narrative to suck you in. Edit: Downgraded to 2 stars as it isn't worth the 2.99$ it costs if you don't have play pass.

's, to, it, Game itself is good, but I don't really see any point of playing it but simply for timekilling. Okay, you get further levels with harder difficulty, but there's no more to it. Still, decent game, I do recommend but for killing boredom mostly.
amounts, to, what, The graphics aren't good enough for a game like this, to tell all these differences apart really fast but I guess that's the point. Just a repetitive memory game is what it amounts to but the concept is really cool.
standing, in, lines, Alot of fun. Simple but very entertaining game. Great for standing in BS lockdown lines at the store.

distract, for, bit, I suppose it's good for people who simply want to distract for a bit, but it's boring as hell (pun intended).
feels, like, seasons, This game is probably fun if you share the developer's values or ethics. It's not a freedom of choice. It feels like the last 2 seasons of Doctor Who. Way too liberal.
works, in, way, This game is amazing and definitely worth playing. The concept is well thought out and works in an amazing way. The game does get harder as you go but is still easy enough to not get stuck on a level for way to long. I would definitely recommend this to everyone in know.

come, across, it, This is a fun game and it's funny. Just happened to come across it and tried it out only to like it a lot! Quick and fun, not to difficult and not a huge time waster. I definitely recommend it.
Inspired, with, none, Its fine. "Inspired" by Papers Please, but with none of that game's complexity or nuance. Pretty simple and reasonably fun but not something to keep you coming back.
sending, to, hell, Fun sending people to hell : )
wasted, on, game, It was not that fun but i could not refund it so i wasted money on a game i dont want
changed, about, game, FUN GAME!!! It has good graphics and it's fun. At first I thought this was the worst game in the world but then I changed my mind about the game.
play, as, reaper, Minimalist Excellence It's a cute game where you play as a grim reaper and have to decide which afterlife people belong in. There are plenty of easter eggs and the game gets progressively harder in the best way. There is also some type of ranking bit where you get points for different horsemen but I have no clue how it works. But I'm sure you'd like it if you're into strategic leveling.

play, for, hours, Very fun game can play for hours and it doesn't get boring.
lived, to, hype, I say jacksepticeye play this game and so i bought it and it lived up to the hype is a really well made good game congrats on the succsess guys!
inspect, for, weapons, Not my jam. Others may like sorting games, but not for me. I left a low rating because it seemed different than it was. Instead of being a dive into moral choices, I was simply asked to inspect for weapons and horns.
based, on, things, Terrible, stupid game. It's a ridiculous concept. I don't understand how this is a paid-for game. Literally just sorting people in two categories based on certain things. That's it. Gutted I paid for this.

reminds, of, papers, Really fun game, reminds me of papers please. Cartoon art style and humor is enjoyable. The overall gameplay is fun. But sometimes it may glitch out either because of my fingers or phone when I try swiping to a certain side. But overall it's a really fun enjoyable game.

introduced, with, something, Amazing game! I love the humor, the concept, and the gameplay! Though it is repetetive at times, you are guaranteed to be introduced with something new with almost every level!
get, for, it, Pretty addictive once you get a pattern down for it. The four horseman interactions could be more immersive but other than that it's a really good play.
Entertaining, for, HOURS, Entertaining for HOURS If you've played Papers Please, this is essentially a similar game except your rejectees get sent to a fiery afterlife. It plays in a way that you can Binge on. I do wish there was someway to restart a level, or to skip the intro. Just because I know some people like myself are perfectionists. A very fun game overall though.

Getting, to, mode, This game is a ton of fun? I highly recommend it. Getting to endless mode is great. My only question is how to save the brain from the zombies!

based, on, mechanic, Its great art and everything is good, except the gameplay is based on just a very simple mechanic. And it tends to get repetitive, I'm gonna keep playing for longer and update this more than two stars if it gets better.
Put, in, game, Put some cool music in the game pls
end, in, Heaven, Just like papers please. People appear, and you have to work out if they end up in Heaven, Hell or Purgatory. More and more obstacles and pop up challenges thrown at you during gameplay. Very good.

sank, into, this, I thought it would just be a little time waster nothing to fancy. However pleasantly surprised I just sank an hour of my life into this on first place. Its easy to pick up, challenging to master and great for a quick blast or a long game. Brilliant and well worth the price.

sent, to, purgatory, Giving this game 2 stars for terrible controls. I don't get it. It says if there is blood on the floor and they have no weapon and have no horns and no blood on the body, they can be sent to purgatory. But it counts it as a mistake saying either guardian lazy or blood on the floor. Edit for developer: This IS a bug. I am not the first to complain about it and I READ EVERYTHING. Your game has a bug. Accept it, fix it, and use better English when responding to reviews.

feels, after, day, I guess it's funny and cool at first, but I get no sense of direction or story. I just follow the instructions and basically do the same. I don't know, feels pointless after the first day or two.
work, for, death, challenging, fun, and addictive game expierience. wouldnt want to work for death any other way.
send, to, heaven, It's... not bad, but not good. The controls are wonky, and you aren't told much about how some mechanics work so you must just... take a guess and pray you are right. The characters you send to heaven or hell... seeing memes is fun, but after a few levels it just gets tiring. And let's not talk about the language settings... Spain's flag with a sombrero de charro? A whole a** mexican hat with Spain's flag? Really? All in all, a kinda fun game but not worth it.

made, on, play, One of the best purchases I made on google play, only thing it misses is cloud save (or I just didn't make one last time I was playing)
Send, to, heaven, Fun detail watching puzzle game. Send the good to heaven, and the bad to hell.
perfect, for, me, Love it, great to pass the time and perfect for me!
work, for, guys, Very fun game! Similar to Papers, Please, but I found it more enjoyable. I wish it had more detailed explanations sometimes. Doesn't really explain much what the "influence" does. It asks you if you want to work for the other guys, but the only guidance is "You work for death, the others are his competition". So, should I not take those jobs? Other than that, the basic mechanic of this game is very solid.

m, in, time, I really wanted to like this game, and im sure in time I may have even grown to love it as much as the other reviews seem to claim. But alas, I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. There's no tutorial, no description. I clicked on the guy with the flag; what do I do? Theres no American flag, am I choosing my language? I clicked on the other guy with the tool and get a pop up and then the guy slips into the abyss and drops right back down. How do I even start the game?

get, on, levels, A. nice funny game I enjoy so far. But half the time I don't understand what's going on actually (the UI is not intuitive) and I don't understand why I get Bs on levels I passed without a single mistake. I replayed such levels like 3-5 times and still getting Bs. Oh well. It would be good to know why at least.

Played, for, hours, Dont bother installing this trash game. Played for 3 hours last night, opened it up today and no progress saved.
get, to, point, It was fun, but being colorblind makes it hard. Also the tutorial is garbage and you really have to want it to get to the point that you know what your doing. I still don't understand most of the menus.
Went, to, lanng, Went to french lanng. I don't speak french
sending, with, firearms, Seriously bias game sending all people with firearms to hell, trying to basically brainwash people into a way of thinking about firearms, no thanks keep your agenda

Pay, to, details, This is a blast. Pay attention to the details before you send souls to their destinations or you will fail like I have :( I do think that a better explanation could've been provided for your relationship with the Four Horsemen. Overall though, this game is a blast. It is....NICE!!!

leaves, with, feeling, Fun, ever more challenging series of 'spot the difference' type puzzler. Esoteric at it's core, the developer leaves the player with a strange judgmental feeling. The graphics are distinct and clean. It gets a bit repetitive and can be slightly difficult to understand the navigation.
play, for, months, This game offer a basic mechanic which is easy to learn but its getting more complicated and fun the more days you progressed. The in-game guide is well-written, I didnt play the game for 3 months but when I came back I just have to read the guide and continued. The dialogs in this game are also humorous and fun to read
points, for, localisations, Cheap, hilarious and very engaging. Really worth its price. Bonus points for suberb localisations!
send, to, hell, Love the concept, however the graphics make it difficult sometimes to see the special characteristics to send someone to hell.
install, on, phone, Boo! Unbelievable! I didn't install this on my phone and yet there it is
do, on, screen, It looks cool, but I can barely understand what any of the buttons do on the screen, there needs to be way more feedback and information than just fingers pointing where I can click. Even starting the game was difficult; Who would think the dark silhouette in the background is the START button? And the screen before you start a round and can purchase stuff: Are you able to scroll that menu? I'd hope so, because if you barely tap an option, it purchases it without any confirmation. Come on.

So much that I have a screenshot of comments that we're emailed to me from Google where you make fun of individuals that have Mental Health issues. It's a "lol" laughing matter to you. You've since changed your comment to, yet, another unprofessional one that you think is cute. I PROMISE YOU THIS. Since working from home I have a lot of time on my hands.

Stuck, on, lvl, Stuck on a lvl that says stuff can be washed away and send to purgatory but fails me regardless of my decision on where to send them. It is not clear! First it says blood on floor can be washed, then on body can. According to prior levels they should remain the same and if no hell signs work bit it just says failed each time.

got, with, Pass, I got it with the Google Play Pass honestly it's a great game
do, by, it, Fun game with a cool retro pc game feel! If u like the game then do right by it. Its dishonest and unhelpful to anyone to rate 1 star just bc u wanna make ur big principled stand on a mobile game devs little $2 game, and this game would be rated higher if not for the ppl doing that. Not asking u lie if u genuinely hated it, but 30 secs to at least give an honest rating and help give real feedback to the devs of games u enjoy isnt some big offensive request, Karen.
compared, to, papers, Kind of simple and boring. I don't get the appeal. And someone compared this to papers please, which isn't even in the same league. I refunded it after a hour. Pass.

work, for, fate, Very memory based the longer you play when you work for fate, your job gets much harder from the cards you have to flip.
played, for, mins, I played this app for 20 mins and am already bored with it. Decent idea, but really monotonous.
fell, in, love, I absolutely fell in love with this game when I saw Markiplier I think it was playing this the Reaper cat is my favorite xD
sending, to, hell, Really cute game. You'd think it's just sending people to hell or heaven but NO! There's more that keep the levels interesting, plots, insites on the 4 horsemen, and unique characters!

Reminds, of, papers, Reminds me of papers please and I love that game
Played, through, game, Played through about half the game. Its a clever concept but it gets old fast. Its just a simple game about making split second decisions sending people to heaven or hell as fast as you can based off what each person looks like(holding a weapon, covered in blood, red eyes, etc). After a while the process seems more stressful than fun.

move, through, levels, Cute, simple, easy to play, and keeps it challenging as you move through the levels. Great arcade-style game!
Worth, for, dollars, Worth it for 2 dollars
bought, on, mobile, I've bought this game twice, on mobile and Switch. Fun gameplay, clever mechanics. Well done, developer.
played, for, star, Lame, played alot and closed the game, all reset to 0, no auto save so for that 1 star...

leads, to, decisions, Game is fun but I frequently have issues with it not recognizing me touching the screen. This leads to frequent wrong decisions and having to redo levels. Edit: Changing to 1 star. It happens way too often for it to be acceptable.

gets, as, sins, Very fun game. simple premise that gets increasingly difficult and goofy as the sins and variations add on. even after playing the 1st part of the game, approximately 2hrs, there is a cool little extended gameplay. thanks to the team who put this game together. one comment: the game with the two open mouths that need to eat the sinners is way to hard, I think mostly because of the controls. maybe change it? have the controls for the mouths on the side?

play, for, minutes, Couldn't work out how to even play the game for about 10 minutes, then once I got to playing second level where you have to send people with horns to hell, you can barely even see the horns.

adds, on, things, Trust me, it's worth the hype! A hectic and fast paced game, gotta have an eye for detail. It eases you in and adds on new things to look for each day.

had, in, store, Knew the game from the PC version, had some extra money in the play store and decided to give it a try. Bless the day i remembered the existence of this game, it's realy realy good! Very fun to pass some time aaaand to test reflexes and concentration. If you'r thinking about buying it, just go for it, it's absolutely worth it!! Great job devs!

feels, like, papers, It's a good game. It feels like papers please but in a heaven or hell kind of thing.
Reminds, of, Papers, Reminds me of Papers Please
Atone, for, sins, Saw a YouTuber play this along with papers please. I love the concept of being like a judge or gatekeeper where you have to catch people trying to lie or sneak in and you have to stop them. This game is very unique in the sense of, there is not just yes or no but three locations a person can go. Depending on if they sinned, or haven't sinned. or worship the devil, or worship God. And if they Atone for their sins. The pixel graphics does add a visual challange but nothing major. 4 stars!
filled, with, bugs, The game is good i enjoy it, but my person experience has been filled with bugs involving purgatory and sometimes elevators, i put the right creature in but it says i didnt and gives me a failed mark, more purgatory that elevators I'll put a human with no weapon no blood on them no horns but blood on the floor send them to purgatory i get a fail saying they had blood om the floor, maybe im not understanding a mechanic of the game but thats my experience

added, in, game, Excellent game with a great concept and good execution. Gameplay is fun and engaging and there's enough challenge and more layers of gameplay added on later on in the game so that it doesn't become stale. 10/10 game worth the money.
getting, with, characters, Really well thought out game, you can tell the developer has spent a lot of time getting this right, with detailed characters and varied mechanics. The steadily increasing difficulty curve is good and manages to track the line between being too difficult and too easy well. Can't find a single bug. Look forward to seeing more from the developer in the future.

bored, after, week, Game keeps resetting my progress. Also very repetitive, bored after the second week
paying, for, it, Really good game. I didn't regret paying for it
throw, in, toilet, Bad gameplay and rude dev. Better to throw your money in the toilet. The low-quality graphics makes it difficult to discern who to send to Heaven and who to send to Hell. Since this is the premise for the entire game, it renders this game unplayable. There are other games of this type on the Google Play Store, so you'll probably find what you are looking for elsewhere. Don't bother with this one, tho. Too many problems and this guy does not deserve a penny.

knew, from, youtuber, This game is great but I knew this game from a youtuber named markiplier and I enjoyed it too much
get, into, kind, This game is INCREDIBLE for a mobile app alone, but is a fascinating game in general. I love how involved the player is in making choices. And each level is interesting and challenges your brain to not get into a kind of, "do the same thing over and over again." This is totally worth the couple dollars and I encourage anyone to get this game. (P.s. on a sidenote the music/soundtrack is fantastic and could make this game 5 stars on its own.

ask, for, refund, I'm sorry but unfortunately I did not enjoy the game or the dlc, can I please get a refund for both, it has been a few months since my purchase and I did not ask for a refund before before because I wanted to get interest on the game, but as you can hopefully see, I barely even played the game
improves, Despite, timatics, Despite the timatics, the game improves the mood. The graphics complement the gameplay and look great. I hope that the game will be supplemented many times by new elements.
Send, to, heaven, Send them to heaven. Send them to purgatory. Send them to hell. Simple, just other things to spice things up.

take, for, immersion, Nice game with easy to pickup gameplay, and cute graphics. However, poor translations sometimes make it difficult to understand what is being said, and can take away for the immersion.
works, on, mobile, Great game, somewhat similar to Papers, Please on PC. Game works very good on mobile and gets more challenging each level.
remains, throughout, game, Underlying game concept remains throughout game but just enough twists are added to keep it fun and interesting until the end.

seems, like, type, It seems like the type of game that, while simplistic enough to ask "Why isn't this free?", is also high enough quality to answer that question with "cuz the game would be worse if it was free-to-play." Bottom line: just pay the chump chamge for the game, ya cheapskates. It's worth it.

have, with, it, I absolutely love this game however I have one issue with it. With the lust people when clicking on them and the person refusing to give it up it does not show any refusal to comply and therefore has led to circumstances were I have presumed it has been refused but ended up getting it wrong.

needs, in, gears, it was a great game, think it just needs oil in the gears here and there to be a well runnin machine though
works, on, mobile, Easy to pick up but gets very challenging as it goes on, lots of variety in the characters and the combination of features. I have the PC version and I think it works even better on mobile as tapping is a lot quicker.

seen, on, Steam, I've seen this game before on Steam but never quite get the chance to play it until now. This game is absolutely mesmerizing. The retro style graphics really make it stands out among other games. The overall fast pace along with the ever increasing amount of 'rules' that you've to remember makes it a fair and challenging experience that prevents repetitiveness. I also appreciate the myriad amount of pop culture easter eggs and references that always put a smile on my face. Highly recommended.

looking, for, something, Really enjoying this game so far. Haven't played too much, but gameplay is simple but fun. I'm a big fan of the graphics too, really well done. It's also fun to see the parodies while playing. If you're looking for something quick to play give it a go.
explaining, in, beginning, could use a bit better job explaining things in the beginning, but still pretty damn fun. EDIT: Better user friendliness than my previous review

came, after, day, This game is great, I loved its pixel style art, and its different ways of bringing challenges. However, after one day I came back and started to play the game again, and it had reset all of my progress. R e a l s a d b o i h o u r s
tests, with, things, Fun, pretty simple until the game tests you with more things to look for before you send someone to their afterlife.

had, with, game, had so much fun with this game
play, without, internet, honestly this game is very fun and a good game to play without internet.
send, to, afterlife, Its a pretty good game. Though, I with you could swipe to send the person to their respective afterlife but overall the controls are easy... beacuse the only contol is to tap.
gose, to, heven, super fun you have to know who gose to heven or hell i like it
do, like, humour, Very fun at first, but it feels repetitive quite fast, and although I do like the humour, there isn't just too much to do in this game.

send, to, hell, I'm sorry 2pac I didn't wanted to send you to hell.
look, into, life, I f**king love this game. Just a casual reaper/every day thing game as you look into the life of a reaper. Everything is well done and comical made, you guys did great. Keeo up the work it payed off
added, with, game, an interesting concept and great humor added in with the game.
challenge, for, scores, Fun, engaging, charming; I like the design and aesthetics. You can challenge yourself for A+ scores if you want to, but it doesn't seem to hinder progress if you slide by with a B. It reminds me a little of Papers Please with pattern recognition, and it changes things up at a reasonable pace. It's simple, but still challenging as you try to maintain accuracy with speed. Has a great sense of humor. Definitely worth the price.

hope, for, content, Wonderful indie game, hope for more content
making, than, that, Not a fun game for me. I thought there would be more depth, but the whole game is just tapping left or right. Heaven or Hell, human or demon. They add factors to make it harder, but there is never anything more to your decision making than that. I guess the only point to it is to try and be quick. Very boring game. p.s. This is the second time I'm submitting this review in 12h. I got a notification that the devs replied, but when I came to check, my review was blank. Seems a little shady.

get, for, money, Damn son, for this money you get a chance to build a reaper career. The music is hell good
put, in, pot, Do you mean the fish bones? If you do, I didn't put the fish bones in the pot.
understand, until, end, This is a really great game for someone that observant and up to the challenge. It is a very great mobile game because it doesn't require an internet connection, you can play it on and off, no microtransactions, no daily login, etc... So you only get the fun of playing the game and none of the usual mobile game BS. The humour is pretty funny but I didn't understand the point of horseman influence until the very end (won't spoil it though) 10/10, well spent money
Gets, after, while, Gets slightly boring after a while. Progression with quite kiddish mindset.
send, to, hell, This game is really fun to play. The mechanics are simple and it runs smoothly. I love the story and the theme levels. The art style is quite charming and I truly enjoy the humor it has, especially the kinds of people you send to hell, heaven, or purgatory. As you progress the game adds new challenges and you're allowed to aid or not aid whichever horseman you prefer. I'm never bored with this game! Also, it'd be cool if you could give your reaper accessories.
stuck, on, screen, The game is fun but every time I close it and comeback to play I have force stop it or it just gets stuck on a black screen and doesn't boot.
peace, in, game, The name of the game says everything, you can peace out in this game until death. I think the best controls on phone, even better than PC. Original graphic, simplicity. Just awesome. Keep doing India games like that please.

skipping, in, menus, The game is fun, but there is a bug with the audio constantly skipping in the menus; it's just way too distracting for me.

sending, to, hell, I read the comments before i bought it and thought I was getting something "brilliant, really fun, amazing!", something almost revolutionary. it's just tapping people sending them to hell, heaven or purgatory. there's nothing to upgrade and it's not really fun for me. it didn't suck but I wouldn't honestly pay a dime if I knew what kind of game this was
working, in, hell, I love working in hell as reaper and judge the clients
working, as, reaper, I love working in hell as reaper and judge the clients
play, on, go, Great game, even better now that I can play it on the go!
get, from, level, Resembles Papers Please, much more fast paced. Worth the money. And I'm a sucker for pixel graphics. Too bad I don't have the time to read the character comments if I'm aiming to get A+ from a level, but it's good that they're there if I ever decide to read them.
Loved, on, computer, Love this game. Loved it on the computer and now love it on the mobile. Thanks to the devs for many hours of fun !

wind, in, hell, so many reasons to wind up in hell, redemption really is a miracle!
prefer, to, people, Worth the money and really is a game I got a lot of entertainment value out of. I personally prefer this game to people that like those fast paces decision games with pretty good humor. Though it doesn't get easier, it gets fairly challenging the more you invest time into it, making the game more balanced and difficult to how you adapt to the rules changing everyday of each week.

played, on, PC, I first played this game on PC. It is a nice and well done game to kill your time. I really recommend!
playing, with, characters, Great game! well worth playing more than once with really interesting characters
take, of, practice, I like that the Dev responds quickly. That deserves a 5 in itself as all Devs should take note of this practice. Thank You for the Good Game and for Chatting with players. :)

recommend, to, anyone, Awesome game would recommend it to anyone. It gets harder each level.
separating, from, hell, I'm having a good time separating people from hell and heaven üò∏
adding, to, game, Fantastic game, a more funny, fun version of Papers Please. Developer is quick to adress any issues, very responsive and continually improving and adding to the game. Amazing value!
Played, on, Note, Played on a Galaxy Note 8 running 9.0 and works best with the S Penüñãkeeping your fingers off of the screen. Fast paced arcade game choosing good over evil. Send evil to hell and good back up stairs. Wish it had better instructions, but it's not that hard to figure out after playing it a few times.

freezing, at, parts, keeps freezing at some parts but when it does play its a pretty intresting game
freeze, during, round, occasionally freeze during the round (note 8)
playing, for, time, Peace, Death! is a fun and brilliant game! It gets more challenging, the more you play it, and each challenge is different, which is great! The retro graphics, and fantastic gameplay, keeps you playing this game for quite some time. Definitely worth a try, and an excellent time killer. Thank you Devs, and keep up the good work!
gets, after, while, it's really fun and I love the references but it gets kinda repetitive after a while
grows, over, time, it's a well made game that requires focus for each item and grows harder over time
sticks, to, concept, Solid and Simple. This game sticks to its core concept and executes it in entertaining fashion. It's difficulty progression is smooth. It doesn't push predatory item stores at you and so ruin your gaming experience. Good Game.

based, on, SEXISM, ‚Äª WARNING ‚Äª This Game is based on SEXISM. There is only one or none female character in each set, and it jeers at hating sexism.
explain, because, message, Let's say that the game deserves 4 stars for the gameplay but one star is removed because it simply doesn't explain some mini games and another star because of the douchy message asking for a review.

send, to, place, Fun but controls a bit fiddly. Careful when tapping away text can send to incorrect place. Bit repetitive. Quotes can get in the way of looking for features.

smoothing, to, curve, It's like Papers, Please, but a much more distilled experience. Effectively smoothing the gameplay to a perfect learning curve. It's quite a snarky game with good humor and lots of love.
linking, to, play, Papers please with demons, also deletes your data even after linking to google play. awesome.
payed, for, everything, it is an interesting game and its quite simple so i guess u could see hiw peiple could like it however i was underwhelmed and a bit disappointed with what i payed for everything is well done though and has an extraordinary consept to it but i just got cuaght up in everything and lost interest. i would wish for a refund seen as i was quite disappointed with what i got and i just didnt see the enjoyment i couldve really gotten out of it. best regards mini

gets, after, while, gets boring after a while
become, on, store, i really like the feel of this game, this game has quickly become one of my favorites on the play store.
rises, in, difficulty, I enjoy this game a lot! It can be easy to presume that it'll start off easy, but it quickly rises in difficulty! The personalities for all of the horsemen are really unique, and add to the gameplay. If you liked Papers Please or similar games, I think that you'll find this game fun!

looking, for, experience, It's a very quirky little game, I've had a great time playing it. It's definitely one of the better games you can get If your looking for a shorter experience. I would recommend buying this game before going on a long car ride, overall It's a good game.

Reminds, of, Papers, Very fun and tedious but not in the bad way. Reminds me of Papers, please.
reckon, after, weeks, Its a good game. fun time waster. the spelling and use of words in the game is a tad off. sometimes a whole sentence does not even make sense. fun graphics, i reckon after about two weeks i will get bored. 3/5.
goes, to, hell, pepers, please, but you are the reaper, and you decide who goes to hell or heaven
spend, on, it, Very boring dont spend your money on it.
make, for, one, I really like it. It's creative and different. honestly would be a cute console game. only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's difficult to tell whether a decision you make for one of the horsemen is good or bad. It seems like they could do more with them.

remove, in, game, I kinda wanna know why did you guys remove that mirror thing in the game? edit:I feel really bad about that...you shouldve tried putting a HUGE warning that says "ITS NOT A BUG, AND ITS A MECHANIC SO DEAL WITH IT". But also again great game!üòÇ
introduced, after, mistake, Mr. DEVELOPERRR!!! theres a weird bug when the purgatory is introduced, after the first mistake when you could wash the blood away from the feet. it freezes. my phone works, goes in and out of the app no problem, but stays in the same level, and screen goes black if you go back in the app.

let, into, Heaven, It's a left or right choice game: let them into Heaven or send them to Hell. It's a simple game made steadily more time aware and complex. Thought provoking.

respond, to, anything, When i first purchased the game and started playing it was fun. Soon after i got a few levels in the game would randomly freeze and wouldn't respond to anything. I'd have to restart the game loosing my progress on the level as well as any money i spent and any mission i was on. This makes the game very frustrating to play and the reason I'm giving it such a low score.
go, to, heaven, I love this game and the idea behind it, it's conversation in game are funny. I think the idea of being reaper and deciding whether people go to heaven or hell with rules was hit perfect.
bought, on, whim, Unexpectedly tickled pink by this game, which I bought on a whim (I love the idea of playing the grim reaper). The game ran smoothly and the stories were pretty great.
itch, for, android, Scratches the Papers Please itch for android, and less reading involved!
downloaded, in, day, Absolutely amazing game! I love the gameplay, graphics, core mechanics and controls of the game; Only thing I recommend is adding more gameplay elements, I got no suggestions but anything will do. Great game overall, one of the few that I haven't downloaded in a day of playing.
crashed, on, level, Poor controls. Boring and repetitive. Game crashed on level 6. I regret purchasing this game.
behave, in, way, I love the blend of pixels and artistic detail. It's entertaining to see death behave in such a way.
play, for, hours, Very interesting concept. Absolutely love it. Can play this game for hours; it's an excellent time killer with good humour. completely worth the money.
love, in, it, Fun as hell game! Gotta love the humor in it, even though you start to judge yourself when a couple of characters I couldn't send to hell üòè. Regardless, graphics and gameplay are great...plus the humor and characters keeps you laughing.

playing, at, pm, Didn't know what to expect but the more I played I got addicted and when I got done playing it was 10am the next day and I had got it and started playing at 5pm the day before so obviously this game is a great and satisfying game thank you for this beautiful creation I will definitely recommend to my friends and play more of your games‚ù§üòÅ

change, to, stars, Great game, I'll probably change to 5 stars, but it just bugged out on me so... Edit: the game froze and set me back a day

found, on, number, Quite funny as writing goes, simple gameplay but entertaining, I found myself on a number of occasions saying "I'll do one more day".
heard, in, game, This game is amazing. The gameplay is fun and fast-paced, The story and characters are entertaining, and the soundtrack is one of best I've ever heard in any game ever. Would highly recommend.
enthralled, from, start, A truely brillant game that will have you enthralled from start to end, and beyond. It's fast paced and keeps you on your toes with new quirks for the clients every (in-game) day. 5/5 Plus the DLC adds even more craziness, I couldn't resist purchasing it and I love the chaos!

go, to, purgatory, Rather fun game. My only complaint is that the telephone calls don't seem to work correctly. Many times am I getting penalties for what I think is the right answer. Like "blood washed off, doesn't yield weapon, go to purgatory" and i assume yes but it's wrong. And other situations like this. Half the time the calls I get wrong, and maybe I truly am just answering incorrectly, but then the description is really throwing me off
Gets, over, time, It's a nice game for a short break. Gets more and more difficult over the time. I would love to see more Minigames like the safe game. Overall I would buy it again.
became, after, little, Awesome game. When paying first time all is seems very unusual, but after a little it became very usable. Gameplay is awesome! :-)
get, with, game, I don't get the hype with this game? It's boring and I think a personal waste of $1.50. The pixel work is ok. I didn't hate it but I sure didn't enjoy it.
play, on, channel, This is amazing if you love a challenge and strategic thinking I strongly recommend this game I may play this on my channel

get, to, gameplay, I really love the game but it takes forever to get to the actual gameplay while the dude needs miney and I can't click to speed it up
used, to, thing, It introduces something new the moment your used to the last new thing to look for and check, which keeps it from getting boring.
paid, for, it, It's definitely a comical game that I enjoy playing and is worth what I paid for it.
went, to, sleep, Forgot to get a refund before I went to sleep... That's all I can think.
enjoy, to, it, This game has amazing graphics, and I really enjoy the pixelated theme to it. The cameos and character models in the game are hilarious. Some of the dialogue is broken but it's very easy to get past.
die, like, times, Awesome game, love the humor literally made me die like 3 times, the art style is great, eye level get harder and harder but so does skill making the game seem challanging but not impossible just wish there was an infinite mode where you could just keep going until the elevator crash but still an amazing game and definitely worth the money (note I have not played the dlc yet).

send, with, weapon, Simple game that gets more challenging as you go. Similar in play mechanics as Papers Please. Some of the instructions are not clear or not applied accurately. Just played a level where I was instructed to send anyone with a bladed weapon or guns to hell. But people with mallets, and bows were also supposed to go to hell. So the original instructions that went out of their way to specify what types of weapons to look for were false.

had, for, day, Only had it for a day, pretty good. Hope it gets better the longer I play
saying, Like, others, Fun and addicting. Wonderful old school graphics that are also adorable. Like others are saying, it's basically "Papers, please" with a heaven hell theme. Which is awesome
agree, with, reviews, Great game love it, I agree with some other reviews I occasionally glitches/freezes very annoying other than that keep it up
send, to, heaven, i had to send donald trump to heaven :(
