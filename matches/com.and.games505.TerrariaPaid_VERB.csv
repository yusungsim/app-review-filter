update, with, version, In general it's a really good game but they just need to update it more like they do with the PC version.
glitching, on, me, It keeps glitching on me waste of money
playing, on, phone, Good game but only issue is the update schedule. As of now there has been an update on pc for a Don't Starve Together update, but who knows when this update will come here. Also please if possible have a setting possibly that puts the old version of game controls up. Ever since the new controls I've just stopped due to so many mis clicks that shouldn't/weren't intended to happen due to playing on phone and my large finger just blocking all the other buttons. But these are my only issues.
played, on, console, I've played this game on both console and mobile for many years, and it's simply the best. One of my favorite games by far. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because you cannot cross play between both console and mobile, which isn't ideal, however I've come to terms with it, I still do wish it was possible. Other from that, this game is one of a kind, can't wait to see more 🙂

suck, for, hours, Terraia is the type of game that can suck you in for hours at a time. The creative world, building, and crafting are so much fun! While PC is where I originally played it, bur they have made it so accessible on mobile and others its worth buying again.

crashes, after, hours, It is fun and one of.my favorite games but it crashes after 1 or 2 hours of playing it.
play, on, pc, I just bought the game, i always play terraria on pc but playing it on mobile is a new challenge for me. Im kinda clumsy with the controls but im getting used to it... it would be great if we can resize every individual controls because i dont really like the scale of it. Only the controls is the downside of this game in my perspective, and please change this for the upcoming updates.

Takes, for, load, Waste of $8... Takes 20 minutes for a world to load, controls are just plain pathetic. Would not recommend anyone waste a cent on this

add, to, it, Fixed my own bugs so I'm editing my review: Please do not ever stop updating this game. I'll buy it again once a year just to keep up support... There's still so much you can do, and it's almost time to open up to allowing mods to become part of the main game. Pay the people who love your game and add their work to it. Moon Lord was only the beginning. It took me far too long to get into this game, but I can say with certainty that I 'get' it.

support, like, this, This is now the 3rd time I've bought & played Terraria (PS3, PC, & now mobile). It's worth every penny. Developers that support their products like this, are far and few between. Also any mobile game that realizes the importance of controller support, is to be applauded. There's so much to do & so much content to dig up. In fact, my only sort of gripe with the game is that you can easily get mired down with your to do list. EASILY THE BEST STAND ALONE GAME PURCHASE I'VE MADE ON MOBILE.

teleport, to, house, Is it bug? npc never seems to teleport to house unless heavy rain or death, annoying since i cant buy pylon..
see, on, youtube, Nice game (I see on youtube where I see a trailer on terraria that is don't starve and terraria update)
building, for, npcs, I love terraria! This is one of my favorite games. I could spend hours just playing and building houses for the npcs. Overall the best game(besides minecraft) I've ever played would recommend for any and everyone

plays, on, phone, I absolutely love Terraria on PC and found an initial love for the game on mobile in 2015. The game plays just fine on my phone considering my phone is not the best. The gameplay has an interesting twist on the PC controls. overall the game is amazing
believe, with, person, Very good I am not lying this is not a fake person I'm serious Ok if you don't believe me with a fake person be able to do this :((())))))))
play, for, long, I like it very good game. But I won't be able to play this beautiful masterpiece for very long
work, For, reason, Edit: For some reason my controller just doesn't work any more. Was 5 star now down to 2. The game is great with Controller but touch screen is pretty bad. 😞 It sux to have to play something else but oh well off on a new different adventure!!!!
is, in, menu, Ok I absolutely love this game it is one of the best and I have over 600 hours of playtime and I saw the one star reviews saying there's no tutorials and what I have to say is yes there is you idiots let me explain so there are not only YouTube videos but there is a tutorial right in the menu and there is one individually on the app store and sometimes you just have to learn and deal with it so stop being a baby and learn yourself or find someone or something to learn off of.

looks, like, terraria, Great game looks just like the PC terraria worth all of the money
playing, for, months, I have been playing the game for a couple months and have finished it, but I opened it recently and now I need to pay for it again. I obviously have already purchased the game, so what is up?

play, with, friend, I want to give a 5-star review, but I can't because of their multi-player confusion. I have spent 15 minutes just trying to play this game with a friend who is not local, and every how-to video says I need to download this or sign up for that. It should be a very simple process.

beat, in, master, I love the game beat everything in master and got the Zenith. But the only bad is they give all the cool stuff to PC players and I was excited to get the cool cosmetics from a competition that some people won because they looked cool and stuff from the 1.4.3 update with the collab with Don't Starve ™️ It would be a 5 if there was the stuff listed above

occupied, for, hours, Amazing game, it's hard enough to keep me occupied for hours without getting bored. There is a variety of things you can do in this game. There are soooo many items. And if have to be honest this game is better than Minecraft.

goes, into, mode, this game is really fun but when i defeated the boss wall of flesh it goes into hard mode and it just dosent load and even if it did work i wouldve allready lost two of the boss drops permanently
played, with, brother, Very good game, I used to think it was bad and worse then Minecraft. But then, I actually played it with my brother, and then I thought it was way better then Minecraft. More boss battles, and building houses is very easy. Love the game (:
added, for, mobile, this game super fun but I wish that the dont starve update was also added for mobile because I dont have it for some reason

setting, to, advanced, Update: hardware configuration aside, found setting the controller scheme to advanced seems to put it in line with the other versions I've played - so here we go, let's begin the adventure! Will update to 5* if they add in saves to Google account / some cloud, for fluid gameplay between multiple devices.

coming, to, mobile, I love terraria and play it alot but I am just confused where the don't starve crossover update is for mobile could you please tell me if it is coming to mobile at all
speaks, for, itself, This game speaks for itself
look, at, mod, You guys should look at the "thorium mod" for this game and add all that stuff as an update! It would make this game so much better, add more NPCs and things to do and make it so you get more then 1 angler quest a day! Make it better

have, on, platform, I love terraria, I have it on nearly every platform. I decided to get it on my phone, and it was great for like a month. Now the app won't even open. Shows the intro screen where it says game name, 505 games and such. Then it force closes. Never gets past that point. It's super frustrating. I've tried clearing cache data and storage data. Nothing works now and it's super disappointing. So much for mobile.

played, for, years, I've played terraria for many years and it's been a really fun game,My only problem is that the PC version is 1.4.3 and has a bunch of items mobile doesnt because mobile is 1.4,But this is still an amazing game :)
changing, to, 1, I'm changing my rating to 1 because of the last few years you still haven't worked on fixing your cloud save problem and don't deserve to be considered a good game. The loss of my dedicated worlds over countless devices makes me utterly hate this game.

crash, on, tablet, Good game but it will randomly crash on my Samsung tablet
used, to, them, I like the game and the controls are easy once you get used to them.
crashes, in, world, My game crashes every time that I go below the surface coordinates in my main world after I defeated the mech bosses, but only in that world. Is there any thing I can do to fix this world? I don't want to discard it.

say, with, heart, I say this with a heavey heart but the NEEDS like 4 updates
played, because, controls, Haven't played this game in forever because of the new controls. Too busy and not intuitive.
begin, in, het, Geweldig spel, in het begin zijn controls een beetje wennen, maar dat gaat na een tijdje beter. English: Amazing game, takes a bit of time to get used to the controls but you get better over time.

played, on, mobile, this beautiful game doesnt deserve to be played on mobile
mobs, with, game, I used to play this game all the time an amazing experince with the new update about a year ago that added all the other items and mobs the only bad experince with the game was the new controls
play, from, mobile, Immaculate game, except one thing that ciuld be improved would be to make an account system that you can save your worlds onto to play them from mobile to pc and console.
continue, on, devices, It's really good game, but no google drive save support (yet?), so I can't safely continue my save game on other devices if something happened to my phone. Pointless to play. Dear Dev, please make save/load (or maybe export/import save) to google drive. I refunded because of this reason.

put, since, Lucy, I've awakend the terraria spirit inside me. So I love it but the crimson is bad so I would put 4 stars but since Lucy the axe it's 5
rate, to, anyone, One of the best games I've ever played Terraria has multiple challenges and adore that the fact that this also has a bunch of different building materials it is very creative. I love the survival aspect of this game and the overall time it takes to progress. I very much enjoy the different class Terraria has my favorites are Mage and Summoner. I rate this game to anyone who likes survival games and boss battles.
wait, for, updates, lan multiplayer is a bit clunky, but good enough. but it's sad how long mobile has to wait for updates and the fact it doesn't have cool vanity like pc
wait, for, something, This game is the most fun when you have to wait for something to appear on a diffrent game ig :/
appear, on, game, This game is the most fun when you have to wait for something to appear on a diffrent game ig :/
see, for, mobile, Alas after all this time we finaly see 1.3 for mobile, and its brilliant. Terraria is forever one of my favorite games. I wish the junping would go back to normal though.
own, on, PC, Love the game. Any chance we will get the 1.4.3 update? I own it on PC and love Don't Starve so having that crossover update on mobile would be awesome 😎👍
love, from, me, I love Terraria! I've been wanting to play this game for so long now! But the controls for the new update are too close to each other, so I can't move very well. The Journey's end update is amazing. I love the new updates. I Love Terraria. Anything Terraria related will automatically receive an automatic like or love from me.
play, on, PC, I love this game. I play on both PC and mobile and was wondering if you could implement the don't starve crossover on to mobile, if not it's fine. I would recommend this app to everyone

put, into, it, I absolutely love the game all the effort and work put into it but it's just the lack of updates that makes it 4 stars
play, for, week, I unfortunately don't have Terraria on mobile but I wanted to rate it. It's my favorite game to play it's got everything a good survival crafting game can offer. Also not to mention there is so many items and enemies that I could play for a week and never be bored like it's so addictive.
paid, for, game, I previosuly paid for this game here, but now it forces me to pay again to redownload...
played, for, years, Terraria is such a great game, I have played this game for years and have only had good experiences. When I first played this game on a different device, I knew almost nothing about the game except I knew that there were cool bosses. I will always play this game because of all the fun and different ways to play the game.

plays, With, support, With the controller support, it plays better than before, something more comfortable about a controller experience, as compared to a touch experience when it comes to specific games. However sometimes I do forget that mobile games are made with touch controls in mind rather than HID support. In any case, as far as my opinion goes this has revived my enjoyment for Terraria.

lost, in, middle, I got a new phone and I lost all of my items I love this game but I lost all of my items and character in the middle of a playthrough
play, for, less, Sooo fun I really appreciate the mechanics of this game ye it's hard but it's Soo fun you play for less then a minute then you can't put it down
playing, near, future, I like this game it's like a Minecraft but have a lot of boss and item, i wish few years they made a terraria but like a Minecraft, i hope i'll see my son playing this game near future
sign, into, Play, This would be 5 stars except you can't sign into Google Play to bring your progress with you. It is very disapointing.

exit, on, phone, I'm experiencing a issue with saving, even if I exit and save it installs my progress, also on the last phone I had I killed the golem and now I cant get back to that point cause my saving isn't working, the only way I don't lose progress is if I leave the games window open which is fine but drains my battery quickly, please fix this.
loved, at, site, I loved the game at first site
say, because, update, I can't say anything, because of the latest update is soo WONDERFULL the controller become better
coming, on, mobile, This game is an example of "you dont need a game to be 3D to be perfect." I hate to be that type of person, but when is 1.4.3 coming out on mobile?
love, to, bits, I love this game to bits and its still 5 star but i have no idea where the new update is but i can wait and give it time! :)
feel, to, it, Love it! I play it a lot and theres a good grind feel to it. Not too hard and not too easy. Massive vatiety of thibgs to see do and create. Live it up its amazing!
played, on, vita, I have countless of hours on the vita version, incredible game and community, and I'm astonished that the current version on mobile is so far ahead of when I played on the vita, and it takes an incredible amount of love and care from the devs to have pushed it this far, even on mobile, so the devs are incredible too

started, on, phone, So I play like usual and I have over 80+ hours since I started on this phone and then today I transferred stuff to an SD card not knowing it would reset everything and I deleted the game and tried to re download and it won't work . (edit you still won't help shows how much you don't care for player base)

play, for, rest, The day I started to play this game it was really good then when I started to get better and learn all the bosses I got scared but I Ashley was a boss but then when I found out it wasn't a boss I just mind it and then I got really good loot and I have build it so many good things I have defeated so many good things and now when I kill the world today I'm sad that the guide won't come back so to make that I'm going to play multiplayer for the rest of my entire game Life
played, on, Xbox, This game is great. I've played on Xbox ever sense 1.3 I think. This would be a 5 star if the controller controls were that of Xbox and not having the shoulder buttons be the start and select buttons
joining, on, mobile, Add razor kishi support and please joining friends on mobile by steam app possibly

harvest, for, reason, I cannot harvest Souls of Night, for some reason. But oh well! It just made my path as a summoner more difficult, however.

forgot, about, it, I've played this when I was about 8 and I'm 13/14 and I forgot all about it when I seen it and I was surprised but y'all should actually play it unless your not into the building and fight and everything 💀

playing, for, years, I love this game. I've been playing it for years, and it is rather amazing how far its come—especially in this recent update, as it feels like the same game but also feels radically different. Can't wait to get it on PC when my computer comes!

used, to, them, At first I hated the new control scheme but after getting used to them, I beat the game and I am currently doing an expert run and it is HARD but I'm getting through slow and steady also I have around 85 hours Edit: all my progress randomly got deleted so now it's 2 stars instead of five

bought, in, past, Give me my money back. I wanted to play terraria not get a headache from the controls. Please refund my money I have bought multiple copies of the working game in the past. Give me my money back or I'm contacting relogic with my adviser . There is no refund option. Give me back my money now.
caring, for, mobile, Re-logic needs to learn to pick up the pace and start caring more for mobile and console because so far they've already released the trailer for the Terraria x Don't Starve update yet they still haven't added 1.4.1 to mobile and console yet!

have, with, game, I have this problem with my game when ever I join my world that I spent 8 hours on its lags out and closes the game, now I am rarely able to play that world, so if the problem could be fixed even though I know you already had your last update you still could do bug fixes. But other than that its a great game

captivated, since, moment, Awesome. This game has had me captivated since the moment I tried it
went, to, it, I just bought the game and now it's says I don't own it. I went to Uninstall it and reinstall so see if that works but it's just telling me to use more of my money.
bought, from, store, Money down the drain. I can't play the game until it verifies that I actually bought it from the play store. I have logged into my account and opened the game. I have stable connection. I have tried everything and it still does not work. This used to be my favorite game and I used to play it all the time but when I redownloaded it ever since it hasn't worked at all. I was looking forward to this a lot and it is just such a let down.

put, into, it, The mobile app versions controls are pretty annoying to use at first but if you put a bit of time into it then they should be fine, I think that the PC version is by far the best so if you have access to it I recommend getting terraria for PC, if we are talking about the gameplay itself then I would say it's one of the best games to ever be made, i definitely recommend getting terraria you will have a great time, that's all

complaining, about, controls, There's a lot of people complaining about the controls being too hard and the game having no tutorial. To them, I say: learn. It's like all new games. U gotta learn to walk before you can fly. This game is amazing, and has done a lot for me mentally. I love the moonlord update and I hope the don't starve collab comes to mobile as well! (I play on 3 platforms as well btw)

placed, around, time, around the time where you could mine placed wood with an axe, is when I started playing. This game does everything right. From the graphics to the mechanics and especially the music and atmosphere. The game overall is definitely top tier, each little thing is amazing. There is so much to explore and everytime you find something new, you get a feeling, and that's really addictive. Even when there's a update coming out soon, it's worth the wait. Do play! ❤️

spent, on, game, I spent all of my money on the game and now it will not let me play it
done, with, this, I love what the devs have done with this. I dropped the game a while back after completing the game and I came back to it and lo and behold, tons of new content. 10/10, would definitely recommend.
play, with, friends, Well, it's a good game overall. But the problem is it's hard to play with my friends..I wish it was easier to host and join even they're away from me...
download, on, phone, It won't download on my phone
sit, at, desk, I bought this years ago but dropped it because the desktop version is easier to play. I recently picked up this version because I don't have time to sit at a desk and game for hours. The new journey mode makes up for the challenge of playing on mobile. Over time the controls get more familiar though I'll never pull off the fancy dodging and skill shotting possible on PC. It's been a more casual, relaxed experience. As a phone game it deserves a solid 5 stars. Congrats to the devs! Masterpiece!

built, to, sun, I've played before it was so easy plus I built to the sun I dont know why ppl think this is a Minecraft ripoff
collect, for, all, Just sucks. Switch sucks as there is no journey mode for me to practice and have, you know... FUN! Not to mention how annoying Wall of Flesh is as its to overpowered with The Hungry and HP AND, damage needs work. Until then, this game can collect DUST for all I care. I'm disappointed. Waste. Of. Money.
do, in, game, the amount of stuff you can do in this game amazing i think better than minecraft
invite, from.other, country, I would give it 5 stars but u should make it multiplayer like i can invite my friends from.other country to join me
use, on, device, Good app,though when I use my Google account on another device ,like my spare phone,I need to pay again.Can you please address this issue?

used, to, it, I love terraria but on mobile the controls are a bit hard but you will get used to it. Would reccomend since it nearly half the price of the pc release and you can get it on play pass.

played, on, Xbox, I love this game I played it on my Xbox through the Xbox game pass ultimate and I was amazed with how much fun it was. Plus Minecraft and terraria both are good games. One time Minecraft had a splash text saying "go play tarraria too" and terraria had a splash text saying "try playing Minecraft too" so I think they are both excellent game's.

invested, into, it, Really good game, I invested alot of time into it as there are so much many more things to accomplish especially in comparison to minecraft as well as the addition of cloud storage and how you can bring your kitted character into your friend's world or a new one however 1 problem; there needs to be a way to rename your character because i misnamed mine 'Scopion' and i really wish to change it even if it costs coins ingame.

came, upon, glitch, I LOVE this game, its endless fun! There are no words i know that can explain how much i love this game. Now if your wondering "Then why not give it 5 stars?" Well, recently i came upon a glitch and i don't think its fixable currently. Now when i open the app, its just a black screen, no color, no image, nothing. The only thing is the music, i can still interact with the game, but no color. The game is unplayable for me now! I tried everything, force stop, re download, everything!

worked, on, game, Nothing left to do when you beat the game, no mods for mobile, I wish they still continued to worked on the game
Link, to, Xbox, good times and i like the update alot but i want to suggest to Link to Xbox And/or Playstation console and more to get your characters and, world to your phone and it can be saved any time, and include Moving the worlds and characters to console and it will be Much more fun
getting, past, bosses, I don't care if getting past the mech bosses is hard af, this is Terraria, which makes it perfect. The controls are great and the UI he's been so thought out so much so that if I didn't know better I would think Terraria was ported to pc from phones. The only thing that could improve the phone version is if someone is stubborn enough to make mod support but other than that thank you for the amazing game.

read, about, controls, I should have read about the controls before making a comment about them, although their still a bit annoying to use, the game is still fun.
ran, for, years, Has ran really well for years and the over all game is amazing but recently it has kept flickering and ruining the whole game and even after trying everything it wouldn't stop so i gave up on it

Loved, until, time, Loved this game until one time it suddenly kept flashing the "Terraria, re-logic" screen all the time, i re-installed the app, removing all my progress, still flashed. VERY annoyed at this, please tell me what the problem is.
u, on, mobile, One of the good games u find on mobile.
spend, on, game, Pretty good game. You can spend alot of time on this game and still not get bored of the game
play, with, friends, I was wondering why I cant play with my friends who are on xbox 1
noticed, for, devs, This is one of the best games ever made, period. Suggestion to players: use a bluetooth controller instead of touch controls. Bugs I've noticed for devs: if you use a controller and select an empty coin slot, then pick up an item from a chest but leave it on the cursor (not in slot or chest) then close your inventory, the item will be placed in the coin slot; also, pressing down on a staircase 1 block above a solid block will phase you through the solid block sometimes

connect, to, phone, Terraria is one of my favorite games. With that said, terraria on mobile sucks unless you have a controller to connect to your phone. The game runs well and is very nice on mobile, but on screen controls just suck in general. If you have a controller to pair with your phone, this will be the game to get into

work, on, chromebook, The game refuses to work on my chromebook now. Every time I open it the screen rapidly flashes. I hope this is a glitch that gets fixxed soon.

preffer, on, playsation, I love the game, i preffer it on my playsation or the xbox
play, for, hour, Four stars it's a fun game to play on and you can do many things, but there's some things that could possibly fixed(1) I can't exactly record videos on terraria (2) it only lets me play for about an hour until it crashes(3) the multi player thing is hard to use, but overall it's very great.
connect, to, account, I think the only problem with this app is the fact that it doesn't connect to your 'Google play Games' account. As such, it won't save your progress on cloud, merely in the application itself.

spend, on, it, Great game! I fully recommend playing it! it's like Minecraft but 2D and with so much more in it! I honestly spend hours on it! And just love playing! I actually plan to get it on my switch for better controls! But I do have one complain, a faw years ago, I was almost to the end, and lost everything, all my saves, all my stuff, everything, I wasn't in hard, just all gone like that, it was heartbreaking, actually kept me from wanting to play again for 2 years, but still a wonderful game!

Came, to, store, Add universal controller support for all gamepads. This is pretty ridiculous. Edit - 2021-10-28 - Came on to the play store, I bought this game twice already and NOW i have to buy a it a third time. I'm not doing it again. I'd Rate 0 Stars if I could.
getting, on, nerves, It really is a fantastic game, but one thing that relly is getting on my nerves...WHY THE HECK DOES IT NOT WORK WITH BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE LOL REFUND

oque, deixa, em, Terraria é um jogo incrível, jogo tanto na versão de Pc quanto na do mobile, mas uma coisa que eu não gosto é o fato de não haver backup na nuvem dos meus mundos e personagens, mas oque me deixa em dúvida é, antes tinha backup na nuvem, e eu tenho que fazer backup manualmente e isso não é prático, além de que eu pra passar os mundos para outro celular ou coisa parecido é um pouco mais chato do que eu simplesmente baixar o mundo da nuvem, tirando isso terraria é meu jogo favorito desde 2011 <3
took, over, months, It's an amazing game over-all. It took me over three months to fully see what the game had to offer, spending 4 to 7 hours on it a day. It's got enough secrets and gear to keep you captivated for a lifetime. However, there are many complications for multiplayer, especially for mobile. I actually came to the game page to try and download it onto my computer, only to have it not listed as an option. It really is too bad. I was really hoping to be able to upload my most played worlds my computer, so I'm not always trying to look into a tiny screen (which I fully understand is a given for mobile games). The point is, multiplayer's tricky; and cross-platform, forget about it. Other than that, easy 5 stars. Literally the best mobile game I've ever had the honor of owning.

put, into, it, Great game, put hundreds of hours into it. The bossfights are awesome, really well made and thought out. The controls are relatively good compared to other mobile games like this and my favorite thing a out it is getting all the weapons to fight the bosses.

leave, on, game, I absolutely love the game.....but the only thing that made me leave one star on the game i love more than minecraft, is the fact that I used to be able to connect worlds with my brother, I have the Hotspot, he hosts, or visa versa; and it would work. We'd be able to connect worlds like that, and minecraft used to be that way too. But now they're both retarded because they updated and made it so you HAVE TO HAVE WIFI! So here's to another enjoyable game gone stupid🥂

spent, on, it, One of the best 2D games I have played but I was very disappointed as my character deleted automatically, very vexing as I spent a lot of time on it .
Fixed, with, patch, Fixed all of my concerns with the most recent patch. Thanks! Edit - I'm not certain if this is new, but I don't see an option to connect to your Google Play account anymore, which means I can't access my old cloud saves...

go, on, settings, Now I get why people quit because they are confused however there is a tutorial. if you go on settings you can see a tutorial toggle button. and on the top right you will see 3 buttons the the one on the left is a help button to figure out the controls btw the person you spawn with you gives help on what to do. If you are stuck then watch HappyDays on Youtube he does really good farms. Edit: forgot to say this but you can arrange your controls positon as well in settings.

filled, with, things, Terraria is a fun game filled with things to do. There's a progression system, there's lots of cool vanity items for you to look awesome, weapons of all kinds ranging from handguns to cat-shooting swords. There's infinite things to build, pvp, tons of mobs, and different events that certain mobs can only spawn in. There's a whole world to explore and build in. There's NPC's that you can purchase and sell items from. There are mounts that can fly and do other things, and there are also pets.

went, through, all, I just purchased this game. Checked my card to make sure it went through all is good on my end. But the game is saying I have not purchased the game. It keeps trying to just take my money over and over. You suck, that was my allowance that I worked hard for,and you're taking my money.
STAND, ABOVE, GAMES, THE BEST GAME IT STAND ABOVE ALL GAMES WITH MINECRAFT AND IS AMAZING FOR HOW COOL IT IS!
had, in, months, I honestly love this game! There are hundreds of critters and monsters to discover, and there are over 30 bosses to defeat. This is the funnest game I've had in months.

recommended, for, people, Great Game! progression is pretty hard but has really good gameplay, pixel characters look really cool especially the bosses and this is recommended for people who want a challenge and love pixel styled games.
growing, with, it, Always loved this game since I was a kid. And my passion hasn't changed one bit, growing up with it, I adored all the different things you could do. It almost seemed infinite. And today I still think so. The Journey's End update added so much for me to enjoy even more. I really recommend Terraria.

playing, since, ver.1.2, Devs. Has always something new each update, players would like...im playing since ver.1.2 then till now... terraria was never a disappointment..i wish going multi would be more easier..(without any third-party apps of course)
play, with, friend, Great and amazing game, but is there a way to make non-lan multiplayer possible? I've been trying to play with my friend that lives quite far, and I want them to enjoy the game as much as I do
running, since, 2011, This game is awesome. I'm not gonna ignore the fact that they've had this game up and running since 2011, and this game is hella fun. If you have not played it, you have to. The game contains a variety of weapons and mobs, along with armor. It's best for survival and adventure if you're looking for some fun, and has a great variety of bosses. It's sad to hear that ReLogic is not working on the game anymore, their game came so far, yet they had to stop. This game is a great game, you should try.

crash, at, time, Seems to sometimes crash at an inconvenient time and not saving completely (the world).

playing, with, family, It's just a fun great game and I love playing it with my family and it's a hard game which I think hard games are better
Complicated, for, people, Note: The Reviews here aren't Bots. This is just a legitimately Great Game. The touch Screen may be Complicated for some people, So just use Controller :D Also- This game is for PC Xbox and 360, So obviously it's going to be worth it's price for Mobile. Buy it RN, You won't regret it.

hate, with, differences, This is essentially minecraft(I hate that game) with a few differences.
play, on, switch, This is a fun game and all, but the controls are pretty hard to get used to, especially when I normally play on nintendo switch. Also, the game randomly closes on me and takes me back to my home screen and I don't know why. Also, I can't select any mode except for journey. Other than these issues, great game! I would also like to see Journeys End come to console (along with lots of other people.) Great job tho. Edit: PLEASE PUT 1.4 ON SWITCH! I WOULD LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!

fly, since, need, its hard to fly since u need to press the joystick button twice up so its hard to dodge and fight when your fighting a really fast and tricky enemy

Love, to, Minecraft, Amazing game! Love the differences in goals it has to Minecraft. I also love all the bosses, building materials, weapons, classes, (etc)!
posting, in, reviews, Great game but the Xbox controller will not work, tried all support articles nothing helps. Lots of others posting the same issue in the reviews so hoping the development pay attention.. Samsung s21, Xbox elite controller, works fine with other games, Deal breaker for me.

tops, due, bosses, SO MUCH TO DO! SO MANY OPTIONS . The best gams ever. Even tops minecraft, due to more bosses and materials, ores etc100/100
kill, in, buildings, Great game but i wish the characters dont lose anythin' after they die and i wish i could kill the NPCs in the buildings.
played, on, ps4, Love it, I played on the ps4 before playing this and it's just the same, it runs so smooth and is so easy to get the hang of. Personally I don't see how people are confused by the controls. No do doubt best game I've ever and will ever play.
need, on, plllllllllllleeeeeeeaaaaaassssse, I need 1.4.1 on mobile plllllllllllleeeeeeeaaaaaassssse
Love, with, bit, Love the game with all my heart bit i dont like the new control. Wish there was a way to put it back

report, via, progress, this is a review about the xbox 1 edition since I don't know where to report via xbox.my progress doesn't save but that's still alright because it's my fault for not saving(even though it should auto save)the problem is that game progress in some place are still there like lit torches by places I was before I saved even though I have the starter equipment
makes, for, it, Worth 50 dollars more than there asking, controls are a little janky but you can hook up a controller via bluetooth wich makes up for it.
lag, as, army, Fun yet difficult whats more to ask for what eles to say controls are adjustable to your preference and if you have a fairly good device you can play and beat this although some parts of the game will lag such as old ones army and the pillar events
played, on, device, It's a very fun game I've played it on my sister's device but when I try to get in it tells me to retry I did every thing it wants but pls pls help me

had, with, Terraria, Amazing, never had bad experiences with Terraria!
create, on, time, It is really fun to be able to create a house quickly on my spare time. Another thing I really like is how quickly you can learn stuff. 5 stars! Great job devs!
finished, with, content, I think this should cost less, as when you finished with the content, you bascially can't do anything else, and there isn't any mods supporting the play store, which sucks. But aside from that the gameplay is is actually the best in the whole play store. It's like modded minecraft 2d, except it's actually good.
went, to, server, Takes awhile to get hang of things. I'm talking several hours just to get to know the game. I gave in, and went to an online server to get better items without having to grind for them forever.

play, with, friends, This game is such a good game from the exploration to the boss fighting. The controlls are a bit difficult but there easy to get used to. It is a lot like mincraft for the people that like mincraft but it hase way more items and way more mobs and bosses. And the fact that you can play multilayer with your friends is just awesome. This game is just soooooo good
sit, for, hours, .I can sit down for hours and just enjoy the game. You can replay it so many times and still have stuff to do. The games a bargain on mobile considering the endless possibilities with this game. I can't lie and say there are no flaws like at times it is grindy and some biomes could have more content but I look at as not only a things for mods to work on (they have )but the grinding is a reason to continue to play. My word limit is ending but I've played since 1.2 and would DEFINITELY recommend.

created, in, opinion, Best game ever created in my opinion.
take, into, consideration, I would love if you made the blade staff a drop from the slime queen on mobile again it's very hard to sit there and grind enchanted swords that never spawn in and souls of night are almost impossible for me to get idk why but could you fix that plz and keep up the great work I hope you take this comment into consideration I love this game none the less
playing, since, 1.2.4, Great game! I love this game and have been playing it since 1.2.4
having, with, it, This is one of the best, might be the best game I ever played. 10/10 worth the payment, extremely recommended game. It's hard at first, but once you did progress, you become very obsessed with this game and having fun with it. It is also a good game to play whenever you're free. It works excellent on poor devices

make, for, everyone, Would love an 1.4.3 update to cross play PC and Mobile devices would make the game more fun for everyone! Great game BTW!
s, for, game, Its great multiplayer lots of boses this is a close call but its as great or even better than Minecraft and thats hard for a game the creators did a wonderful job but its not for under 7ns its prety scary at that age all in all great game
playing, on, chromebook, This game is super fun, I am playing on a chromebook, and the controls are rather simple, though hard to figure out at first. If you are playing on mobile, the controls are probably different. This game is not boring, and fun to play for hours on end.

rushing, for, weapon, i think it was better with the orignal mobile layout, i mean the hud and all that feels overbearing now and before it was minimalisitic yet higly finctional. Now i feel like i have to think more before i do something, and the smaller buttons invintor are hard to push especially when im rushing for another weapon creating latency wich is bad in bosses. Im not saying revert it but atleast have a differnt mode or a whole other app altogether. Please please consider having the older layout available
played, since, school, I've played this version since high school. Ioved how it grew. The controls are complex when you first try out, especially when the controls changed to; of course I was used to the old ways of terraria. I love the 1.4 update now. I wish I could switch phones. I really loved that you can finally use the furniture that you made. It's fun to remodel underground cabins into your base.

go, into, world, Yea so I have this game on ps4 and I had to get the solar pillar twice now and when ever I leave my friends server and go into my single player world I lose it and the first time it happened I lost my last prism and my solar flare armor pls fix this
played, for, years, Love the game, I've played It for years across multiple platforms: mobile, Xbox360, PC and XboxOne. Mechanics are amazing, there's so much to do, the bosses are incredibly cool and the game is actually challenging (especially bosses, the underworld and the dungeon) unlike most games like Terraria where you can just walk through any foe almost immediately. Only gripe is that there isn't KB&M support which I'd really love to see. It'd help keep up with contenders like Minecraft + improve the game.

It's fun, but mobile version after the update to controls just dropped the greatness, not to mention after the most recent update, my Xbox One controller cant connect to terraria. The game doesnt read inputs, tried to set the controlls manually, in-game, nothing. It just refuses to work. Until then, I'am staying uninstalled. Devs, please fix 😶

own, on, platforms, Games amazing I own this game on five different platforms and they've all been an amazing experience. Soon however there will come a time where I don't play on mobile anymore as the Steam Deck isn't too far away. It's been a fun time playing on mobile tho. Much love to everyone who worked on this amazing game, I feel like my live would be different without. Considering several days of my life have been spent playing this. Thanks again for making my favorite game.

Playing, on, chromebook, Needs keyboard/mouse support. Playing on chromebook only few of the keybinds work and important ones like inventory dont work, forcing the player to click the inventory button with the cursor. Things like this are the reason my rating is what it is, other than that great game.

Love, on, console, Love this game on console, so was really excited to play on mobile! Been loving playing on mobile while awaiting the console's final update! The ONLY negative I have is that it is not possible to transfer save data between phones if you upgrade or change handset... Add the ability to access saved games across all platforms and I'll add a 5th 🌟!

building, for, pylons, During my isolation, Terraria is the recommended to play its fun and addictive, Gameplay is chef's kiss, Combat is good, Enemies is well balance, Creativity is wonderful! Beating my first expert mode felt good like the suffering, dying multiple times, building a ton of houses for the pylons, RNG really hates me and defeating all bosses including new two bosses is the worth of time and experience. And maybe I go try beat master mode and died about 2 minutes by a slime. Go for it buy it. NOW,NOW

compared, to, PC, Personally, game is okay but, experience-wise, it's difficult to control movement and aiming compared to PC. I don't think it's good to play this in the phone as you need good controls to perfect the aiming to hit enemies precisely and movement to avoid attacks. I would like to request a refund for this please.

fallen, over, heels, I have fallen head over heels for this game. From the bosses to the events to the items to the crafting, I absolutely love it! Everything about it is super great and I have put over 100 hours into my main character. The only gripes I have with this game are that it crashes every couple hours, which in terms of time I spend playing this game is often. Although, it could just be my phone as I do have some experience with crashes from other games. Thanks for making this wonderful game!

playing, since, 2015, The game just glitched as I was saving and deleted my world and character I hate to rat this game 1 star but the website for 505 support is a God awful nightmare fix your game I've been playing since 2015 these things shouldn't happen no reason for it to delete days of my time.
add, to, refund, Unable to add to family library - refund received. Disappointed!
was, like, button, i say four stars because i want to play online so bad but you need wifi to host and using other apps is to complicated wish there was like a invite friends button
fumble, with, controls, I want my money back. Controls are ridiculously complex, especially when you get mobbed nonstop. I don't have the time or patience to fumble with the controls long enough to build a simple structure. Lost Miner is a much better game, IMO. Same concept, only better and free to play.
do, in, game, Ther are so many things to do in this game! Lot's of bosses, enimies, and I find the caves really cool!
playing, for, years, Love it been playing for years. For ?
playing, in, 2015, I started playing this game in 2015 and I love how much the game changed
playing, since, beginning, Been playing terraria since the beginning and I still love it and It will never die
