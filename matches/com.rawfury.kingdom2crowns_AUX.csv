's, game, good, It, It's a good game but I can't use the zoom in feature
's, complaint, old, It, Great game, right up until you accidentally misclick a tree and destroy your entire run. And yes, there is a strategy, and being uncompromising is part of the game. Don't get me wrong, I adore this game. But losing hours of progress because your coin goes to a tree instead of the peasant you meant to? It's an old complaint, and I keep coming back, but it's an instaquit every single time it happens. Add in an undo option (even if just for trees and with no return) and the game would be perfect.
's, game, good, it, I REALLY like the game, but the new update doesn't let me fix my camera to zoom back in. It's really bugging me and I tried to delete it and re install it it didn't work. Otherwise it's a good game.
's, game, ok, it, A good game to play. Love the art and style to this game. Game play is good as well. Much better then the fist game a bit. Have not played the multiple part of the game yet though. Only problem is the frame rate get bad when there's lots going on. At some point you have so much people on screen and so much monster it drops a lot. But it's a ok game.
's, strategy, nice, It, It's a nice strategy and casual game but multiplayer is a bit difficult if the screens were facing in different directions it would be easier
's, magic, pure, It, I've played over 1,000 hours of this game and Im still not tired of it. It's pure magic.
is, game, underrated, This, This is the most underrated game ever! Amazing art style and easy to understand. So far I've played all the modes but the only I realise is everytime I come back from another island almost all my walls has be broken down, even though I've destroyed all the portals. Is this a bug? Or is it part of the game if yes then i don't actually understand whats the point of it? Overall amazing experience and money well spent
be, game, perfect, it, 4 stars cause of no male option for deadlands other than that and customization for flag,color,and,character look only has a random instead of getting to pick what you specifically want fix this and it would be a perfect game i did pay id like my money to go to the perfect experience thank you devs
's, playing, disorienting, It, There's no zoom button on the game now ? It's very disorienting playing in 1√ó plz help me help you üòä
is, game, favorite, This, edit: game is unplayable. screen is unresponsive when trying to spend coins. I've been playing the kingdom games on my nintendo switch for years now, but carpel tunnel syndrome has made that difficult. I was so happy to see there's an easy to play mobile version! The minimalistic controls are amazing. This is my favorite game in the world.
is, game, good, This, Hello. There's a problem when try to tap the coins. Is not working very well on my phone. I can't enjoy the game. Please fix it. Thanks. This is a good game. ‚ù§Ô∏è
is, day, sad, it, ive loved kingdom games since they came out and to this day can not find another game so peaceful and amazing, that is why it is such a sad day that i can not play properly because i can not see my map anymore and the lag is so bad i can barely see
is, moment, dull, which, Very polished game fun to play and always find my self using different strategies which to me is great never a dull moment.
is, game, fantastic, this, There's some performance issues, frame rates drop and lags here and there but otherwise this is a fantastic game!
's, game, great, It, It's a great game. I was a fan of the first game and played both on xbox. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the lag. It didnt take long before I was dealing with a lot of it and it ended up costing me some things I needed to keep building my kingdom. The first game ran great so idk why this one is lagging so much.
's, value, great, It, I absolutely love this game! It's great value for money and has a unique style and gameplay!
's, problem, only, that, Great game however I'm not so fond of the dead lands mud/land texture but that's my only problem the rest of this game is amazing and I love it
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game, I played the original and would watch gameplay videos back in 2017 and I absolutely love the graphics and gameplay of it. I've been waiting for this one for over a year and a half when it was announced, I was so hyped for this and now that it's here I'll be playing this one for hours. 5/5 would pay 10 dollars again tbh.
IS, ISSUE, REPEATING, THIS, Its great game but the bugs are outrageous. Have 4 weapons ready for the people to pick up, and 6 villagers who are standing next to it ignoring it. Id say that with time i think the issue will be resolved but THIS IS A REPEATING ISSUE FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME THAT STILL HASNT BEEN RESOLVED THERE EITHER
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game. I just wish the screen ratio would be wider with the S10 rather than a smaller aspect ratio, unlike Kingdom New Lands. It seems a step backwards in that regard :(
is, game, good, It, It is a good game, and a great sequel, though I did refund for it was too laggy for my device. The first one never lagged, so I'm assuming it's because this one has many more assets. I will reinstall it but that's only if the performance ends up better. Other than that though great game! I love it!
are, side, right, They, Great Game but could be better. Reason being there is a lot of things that could be fixed. For example the zoom I would really like to zoom out. Next the fact that two people can play together is amazing! My sister absolutely loves the Griffin. But the split screen is weird. They both are right side up. One of them should be upside down for better and easier game play. Also this might be my device or something but whenever I walk past a decent amount of archers or just people my frames drop FAST
be, time, fourth, This, This would be the fourth time I purchase this game, but I finally get it on my OnePlus 7 Pro. The addition of monarchs was an exceptional improvement from an already fantastic game, giving it a whole new experience that makes it well worth the price. In this game, you can go about it in any way. I've replayed it numerous times, improving my strategy from the last. It comes with three versions packed in one, essentially giving you three whole experiences. I've had no issues with the gameplay.
's, cute, extra, it, Way worth the price considering how long you'll be playing. No IAP. This game is so a d d i c t i v e pls help me stop playing. Plus it's extra cute. Slight lag from time to time on my smartphone, which is a very recent medium range model. Too bad the only way to play multiplayer is being two on the same phone, it's really inconvenient.

's, game, good, it, The game is a bit expensive in my country, but its been worthing the money so far. The only problem I'm facing is that I can't connect to Google Play. Every time I try to do it, the game just freezes and stop working. Please, consider fixing it in the future. Despite that, it's a really good and fun game, just like the first Kingdom.
's, system, alright, it, Tested on a Razer Phone 2. No problems so far. Touch controls are weird, but doable. Some of the instructions for investing money is confusing. To drop coins is a tap, to invest in buildings, equipment, etc. you drag down. Not sure how this would affect my efficiency but it's an alright system. Aside from that, everything looks like regular Kingdom Two Crowns...which of course is amazing for those who enjoy managing towns and defending against monsters. Best check out the wiki if you get lost.
