is, game, good, This, This is a very good game
's, waste, pure, it, On one hand, the humour can be quite funny..on the he other hand, it's a pure waste if time.. I think 3 stars are fair..
's, thing, minor, that, EDIT: Yeah lol that review was really old so I'm redoing it. I had indeed selected the incorrect save slot at the time, I'm just a dumbass lmao xD Excellent game, no complaints, full stars! The gameplay is simple yet challenging and the humor in the game is really well done for the most part. Only complaint is it's not made explicitly clear that the horseman's points are bad and you want as few as possible, but that's a minor thing and really no big deal. Well worth the price!! :D
is, bro, amazing, This, This is an amazing game bro no cap
is, one, good, it, Peace, Death! is not a bad game, but it isn't a good one, either. The graphics are pretty good, though, and the gameplay can be somewhat fun, but it gets boring very quickly. Still, I can definitely appreciate the effort that the developers put into the game.
is, game, fun, This, This is such a fun game, I've been playing every now and then this past month and it's so fun, the strategy in the game gets harder and harder with each day and I can't describe how good it is so just get it
is, game, good, This, This is a really good game. Challenging and unique.
is, game, fun, It, It is a fun game
be, game, good, this, Wonderful. I was not expecting this to be such a good game. Best thing in a long time!
is, game, excellent, This, This is an excellent casual game. It has fast gameplay, simple controls, a steady difficulty curve, and a lot of smaller objectives for completionists. There is a Switch port but I highly recommend the Android version just for how simple it is to pick up and play!

is, game, fun, It, It is a very fun game i had a great time pointing out the references and enjoyed the DLC
is, game, fun, This, This is a fun game and it's funny. Just happened to come across it and tried it out only to like it a lot! Quick and fun, not to difficult and not a huge time waster. I definitely recommend it.
is, game, great, this, The more I play this game the more I like it! If you like Papers Please, this is a great mobile game for you!

was, game, worst, this, FUN GAME!!! It has good graphics and it's fun. At first I thought this was the worst game in the world but then I changed my mind about the game.
's, game, cute, It, Minimalist Excellence It's a cute game where you play as a grim reaper and have to decide which afterlife people belong in. There are plenty of easter eggs and the game gets progressively harder in the best way. There is also some type of ranking bit where you get points for different horsemen but I have no clue how it works. But I'm sure you'd like it if you're into strategic leveling.
's, concept, ridiculous, It, Terrible, stupid game. It's a ridiculous concept. I don't understand how this is a paid-for game. Literally just sorting people in two categories based on certain things. That's it. Gutted I paid for this.

is, game, wonderful, this, this is a absolutely wonderful game, reccomend to all who play these type of games.
's, game, fun, it, Really fun game, reminds me of papers please. Cartoon art style and humor is enjoyable. The overall gameplay is fun. But sometimes it may glitch out either because of my fingers or phone when I try swiping to a certain side. But overall it's a really fun enjoyable game.

's, game, okay, It, It's an okay game. UI is terrible, bare bones descriptions. Bugs everywhere. Whoever said it's funner than papers, please that's definitely not correct at all.
is, thing, good, that, Not too bad it's a lot of fun to play more of a challenge than what I thought it would,and that is a good thing!
's, play, good, it, Pretty addictive once you get a pattern down for it. The four horseman interactions could be more immersive but other than that it's a really good play.
is, game, similar, this, Entertaining for HOURS If you've played Papers Please, this is essentially a similar game except your rejectees get sent to a fiery afterlife. It plays in a way that you can Binge on. I do wish there was someway to restart a level, or to skip the intro. Just because I know some people like myself are perfectionists. A very fun game overall though.
be, time, little, it, I thought it would just be a little time waster nothing to fancy. However pleasantly surprised I just sank an hour of my life into this on first place. Its easy to pick up, challenging to master and great for a quick blast or a long game. Brilliant and well worth the price.
's, game, actual, It, It's an actual game without stupid Microtransactions. As such it already deserves five stars. But the gameplay is also superfun if you like games like Papers please.
is, game, great, It, It is a great game but it chould use some more i don't now what tho but rather then that great game
is, idea, great, tho, Even tho is a great idea for a game, after downloading it; game's language was either on Korean or something else which made it impossible to play.
's, matter, lol, It, EDIT: I'm happy you find this a laughing matter.. So much that I have a screenshot of comments that we're emailed to me from Google where you make fun of individuals that have Mental Health issues. It's a "lol" laughing matter to you. You've since changed your comment to, yet, another unprofessional one that you think is cute. I PROMISE YOU THIS. Since working from home I have a lot of time on my hands. I will spend a lot of it today in contact with Google to get them to pull your app.

's, game, great, it, I got it with the Google Play Pass honestly it's a great game
's, game, good, It, It's a good game when your bored, doesn't get boring real easily
's, thing, bad, that, I love this, its simple but that's not a bad thing
's, game, good, It, It's a good game. It feels like papers please but in a heaven or hell kind of thing.
is, game, fun, It, It is a very fun game, it is a little boring at first but once its picks up it's super fun, totally worth it
be, game, free, This, Boring pointless, it was only on sale to get more downloads. This should be a free game
's, experience, fun, It, It's a fun experience to just play if you're bored :D
's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game! Challenging, but really fun!
been, months, few, it, I'm sorry but unfortunately I did not enjoy the game or the dlc, can I please get a refund for both, it has been a few months since my purchase and I did not ask for a refund before before because I wanted to get interest on the game, but as you can hopefully see, I barely even played the game
's, game, good, It, It's good game... Пи..сдэс
's, love, wasted, it, Jack play it on PC and now I have it and it's a time wasted love it
's, game, sorting, It, It's a sorting game, more or less. Didn't think it would actually be as fun as it turned out to be.
is, game, awesome, this, this is an awesome game I love the catastrophes simple controls really gets u to think fast best game ever or at least my favorite game ever
was, game, great, it, it was a great game, think it just needs oil in the gears here and there to be a well runnin machine though
'm, fan, big, I, Really enjoying this game so far. Haven't played too much, but gameplay is simple but fun. I'm a big fan of the graphics too, really well done. It's also fun to see the parodies while playing. If you're looking for something quick to play give it a go.
is, game, great, it, This game is a lot like Papers, Please. only this requires you to be faster. Overall it is a great game so far, not impossible, but not easy to get a perfect score.
's, fun, much, It, It's so much fun! Glad I paid.
's, game, best, it, I love this game it's the best game ever!
's, killer, fun, it, it's a fun time killer, granted, a bit tough but hey, that's what makes it fun
is, time, second, This, Not a fun game for me. I thought there would be more depth, but the whole game is just tapping left or right. Heaven or Hell, human or demon. They add factors to make it harder, but there is never anything more to your decision making than that. I guess the only point to it is to try and be quick. Very boring game. p.s. This is the second time I'm submitting this review in 12h. I got a notification that the devs replied, but when I came to check, my review was blank. Seems a little shady.
'm, people, other, I, Not a fan at all that they used the likeness of tupac and I'm sure other people.... usually open to stuff and have a good sense of humor but I find using the likeness of a dead person to be bad in taste. Would like a refund
is, game, great, This, This is a really great game for someone that observant and up to the challenge. It is a very great mobile game because it doesn't require an internet connection, you can play it on and off, no microtransactions, no daily login, etc... So you only get the fun of playing the game and none of the usual mobile game BS. The humour is pretty funny but I didn't understand the point of horseman influence until the very end (won't spoil it though) 10/10, well spent money

is, fun, much, it, I really like it! It gets frustrating, but it is so much fun.
's, fun, good, it, a beautiful little game about death, it's good fun to play and a great time killer
's, app, good, it, it's a really good app
's, way, fun, it, it's a fun way to pass time. I like the 4 horsemen as well. a little basic. still, well made.
's, game, sweet, It, It's a sweet little game, with nice graphics and attention to detail in the pixellated characters (pestilence's pet rat is great, for ex.), but three stars off for the butchered localisation. Some of the sentences are barely intelligible (especially bad with the phone calls). It's distracting and cheapens the whole experience. :/

is, game, nice, It, I first played this game on PC. It is a nice and well done game to kill your time. I really recommend!
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun and challenging game and I love it a lot, definitely worth the money
's, game, made, it, it's a well made game that requires focus for each item and grows harder over time
is, game, fun, it, it is a fun speedy evaluation game. I m big fan of Papers Please and while this game is more simplified variant of the work simulation genre, it still presents the frantic nature that is fun.
was, experience, nice, that, that was a nice experience and excellent gameplay. but there's a lack of explaining what things do. for example what is the horsemen's ratings are for?
is, game, interesting, it, it is an interesting game and its quite simple so i guess u could see hiw peiple could like it however i was underwhelmed and a bit disappointed with what i payed for everything is well done though and has an extraordinary consept to it but i just got cuaght up in everything and lost interest. i would wish for a refund seen as i was quite disappointed with what i got and i just didnt see the enjoyment i couldve really gotten out of it. best regards mini
's, game, quirky, It, It's a very quirky little game, I've had a great time playing it. It's definitely one of the better games you can get If your looking for a shorter experience. I would recommend buying this game before going on a long car ride, overall It's a good game.

is, game, great, this, this is a great game
is, copy, exact, this, ok so this is a exact copy and port of a pc game called apocalips inc and they didnt even change the word bubbles they just changed the name but the game is fun altho it illagle to sell this to people
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game to where your making the wrong choice can have you wanting very it right the second time. Each day have you memorize more and more things to look for. ENJOY!
's, game, simple, It, It's a really simple game, but gets harder. It's like papers, please on mobile. The controls are really simple, just tap left or right.
's, game, okay, It, It's an okay game, but there's really no reason to keep going except to see what "job title" you get next.
's, game, left, It, It's a left or right choice game: let them into Heaven or send them to Hell. It's a simple game made steadily more time aware and complex. Thought provoking.

is, game, favorite, This, This is my favorite game ever
's, killer, excellent, it, Very interesting concept. Absolutely love it. Can play this game for hours; it's an excellent time killer with good humour. completely worth the money.
's, phone, strong, it, Really fun but freezes too much to be playable and I'm using the galaxy s8 it's a strong phone the game was made poorly
is, answer, right, what, Rather fun game. My only complaint is that the telephone calls don't seem to work correctly. Many times am I getting penalties for what I think is the right answer. Like "blood washed off, doesn't yield weapon, go to purgatory" and i assume yes but it's wrong. And other situations like this. Half the time the calls I get wrong, and maybe I truly am just answering incorrectly, but then the description is really throwing me off
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game for a short break. Gets more and more difficult over the time. I would love to see more Minigames like the safe game. Overall I would buy it again.
are, cases, special, they, The only job I have ever enjoyed doing and ever will. I look forward to this everyday. I play it like its my actual life style. I have a alarm set at a certain time everyday. When it goes off at a certain time during the day that means its time for me to clock in to work, and send a'couple people to hell a'couple, and a'couple people to heaven If they are special cases I send em to the purg and let them sort it out. Whos knows Another day another dollar as a reaper. When my shift is over I clock out and do it all over again tomorrow. 😎👍
is, game, great, This, This is a really great game it's funny and interesting
's, game, comical, It, It's definitely a comical game that I enjoy playing and is worth what I paid for it.
be, asset, great, that, Easy to pick up, easy to put down. A very fun arcade game that'll be a great asset on your phone whenever you have some time to kill.
