VERB, PREP, POBJ, 
drive, to, saves, Works fine, with DS4 too. Only problem I had, google is blocking it's access to drive to upload/download saves.
use, for, multiplayer, Great app! 5 stars if we are able to use it for multiplayer, lol
crashes, on, effects, Great emulator expect that it crashes on certain amination effects. FFTA2 is essentially unplayable due to crashes.
read, in, phones, This was a good emulator but since Android screwed up the ability for emulators to read SD cards in the phones this app is completely useless! Paid for an app I can't use......

Casting, on, targets, Incompatible with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2. Some animation sequences always crash the game, known causes below (these are repeatable): Casting thunder magic on 3+ targets. Third target animation always crashes emulator Klesta using the Devour attack on 2+ targets. Emulator crashes during this animation every time Any Hunter using the Sidewinder ability. Animation crashes the emulator every time. These animations do not crash other emulators, but developers have been silent.

read, as, card, Can't read as card and it screwed everything up when I transferred my games to my sd card. Even after transferring them back to internal storage it was still screwed up and wouldn't read them.

use, for, phone, works p well! controls function properly. my only complaint is that the controls take up a HUGE amount of the emulated touchscreen space. if you're playing a game with touchscreen commands, especially timed ones, you're v likely to fail because the screen is hidden by the controls. this is *partially* fixed if you use a stylus for your phone, but not entirely. if i was using a tablet or even a larger phone, this would probably be *perfect*.
takes, to, empty, When I go to load new game, it takes me to an empty /storage and there's nothing else I can do
Stuck, on, icon, Hi I cannot access my directory. Stuck on the folder icon. Keep pressing but no response as unable to navigate to my games folder.

runs, without, issues, Worth the price, runs without issues with built in features like lid closing, microphone or touchscreen, requires almost no configuration and zero technical knowledge to setup properly.

find, in, device, After the last android update this app can't find rom in device so please fix permission for this app
read, from, STORAGE, A bit broken on Android 11. Can then only read from INTERNAL STORAGE, not SD card due to "scoped storage". Other than that works flawlessly.
open, to, search, Cannot open black folder to search. :( Android 12.5 Xiaomi Redmi 9 and Xiamo Poco X3 Pro, same result.

crashes, after, minutes, Literally crashes after 3 minutes of play time and wont load save
used, for, years, I e used it for years and it works great. Using a note 9
notice, on, game, Works well for me. I have a 2018 honor phone and a Samsung SD card. Also a 2017 Fire 10 tablet. Brilliant for puzzle, card & board games. Being able to swap screen position and move the on-screen keyboard around makes my games very playable. I did notice lag on one game, but all the others I play have been fine so far. Also loving the save/load game state. Makes games even more playable! Haven't tried with an external controller yet. Will update review if I manage to try.

switch, between, roms, Best ds emulator period. can play both homebrews and original games no problem, plays 60fps smooth as silk. has tons of customization options, and you can switch between roms effortlessly.
Paying, in, Rupiah, The emulator doesn't want to scan games and it won't let me open folders manually. I am using Samsung Galaxy A20s. Please solve this problem, i was playing fine almost a month ago, reinstalling doesn't fix the problem. Paying in indonesian Rupiah is worth a month of meals here, so It's a bad deal to be paying for an app that doesn't work. I'd consider changing the rating if this bug is fixed because DraStic was one of the better DS emulator next to No$.

works, with, sorts, This emulator works well with all sorts of android devices. I started use with an s5 and now have the s10. I did notice the drive saves didn't really work but haven't checked since then. Either way...a great emu

triggering, at, time, The controls seems quite buggy to me, base on my experience while playing some games, triggering 2 or 3 buttons at the same time they're not functioning correctly ...
happen, with, Dpad, It's a good emulator and does what it says. I have a major problem with the controls though. This doesn't happen with the Dpad but but the A and B keys keep getting pressed all the bloody time. No matter how big i make them/ move them around or even have it on Landscape. Can we customize the buttons fully to be able to move each one? A slight move further apart will fix this simple problem... Phone is a Samsung S8 EDIT: No longer works with android 11

appear, For, reason, For some reason none of the games appear just stuck on a file explorer and can't do anything when trying to load a game (search for)
allow, AT, ALL, App doesn't allow navigation of folders AT ALL. Displays a single folder with '..' even after creating a user and specifying a directory, which doesn't even show games outside of a folder. Pure garbage.
find, in, card, Once was great now with Android 11 it will not find Rona in SD card. Now it's worth less. Plz fix this
crash, on, Pokemon, As long it doesn't crash consistently on Pokemon I'll leave it 5 stars. Though I will say the button inputs do not feel very fluid.
link, to, hassle, i reinstalled this app but black folder won't respond.. i click many times, nothing happens and that i need SD manager just to link the games to my drastic app :( hassle
map, to, controller, Best ds emu! I just wish that the touch controll could be map to a controller like the right stick for fps games. Im not really a big fan of touch aiming. Keep it up devs!!
paid, via, pay, Hey , The app is great !!! I have one query I have paid twice , first I paid via google pay the amount was debited , but I didnt get the game , next I paid via Vodafone wallet and I got the game , Could you just check out and refund the money I paid via google pay

riddled, with, ads, I've tried a few of the free emulators, and this one rides a Ferrari. The others I've tried are riddled with ads and seem to be poorly optimized or purposely slowed down. Can't wait to play some childhood classics
refills, to, 649, The Dreamworld Encounter cheat on Pokemon White only works partially- it refills pokeballs to 649 and masterballs to 100 but doesn't change the pokemon you encounter at all I'm on Route One and doing everything the cheat says to do but still encountering Patrat and Lilipup and not dreamworld ability Snivy.

works, on, phone, Great app, works perfectly on my phone no issues, I have an acer spin 311 chromebook, however, that I cannot get it to run on at all, It will not load most of the games I have with one exception as far as I"ve tested, it will run spirit tracks, that is all. currently wont even load up any of the games in my folders but only on my chromebook. I've gone so far as to extract the roms myself to no avail. Maybe my chromebooks too lowend Idk

select, on, Android, Currently on Android 11 and can't change folder, can't select any game, unplayable at the moment.
play, on, anything, Rendering perfectly. Key features: Quick save state (works perfectly), portrait and horizontal gaming mode, emulated monitor switch. Overall I wouldn't play it on anything other than vertically because it feels more like a NDS. 5 star for smoothness of emulation, 4 star for UI and 5 star for rendering multiple instances (the reason I had to switch over). One update you could have several save states so S1, S2 and maybe S3. Very happy to pay for this!

resize, to, 1x, Basically unplayable when using split screen mode on Android. Resizing doesnt work becuase it wont save changes. It gives the option to resize to 1x or 2x but wont save even when i click both "save as global" and "set as current". After messing with it i can resize it in the editor but again will not save changes, although when i go back to the editor the changes are already there.

Built, in, cheats, Honestly the least intrusive ds emulator on android. Built in cheats are a nice way to spice up gameplay of an old game.
opposed, to, emus, Absolutely worth the $5. Runs very smoothly, as opposed to more choppy free emus. Edit: i can't seem to see any files in the app anymore, it only takes me to the /storage file, and i can't change it. This means all my progress is lost. Please help.

downloaded, from, site, The best NDS emulator in the store Worth paying for. The load and save States works. all the games I've downloaded from an Nintendo DS rom site works. It's smooth and easy to use. Looking forward to what else the developer has in the future.
Need, over, buttons, Need more control over virtual buttons.

tap, on, game, I start up drastic, tap on load game and it brings me to a blank screen with nothing to tap on, just a folder at the top that does nothing and also shows /storage without letting me choose or find the folder that has all my games on, what the heck am I even supposed to do...

built, in, cheats, Works almost flawlessly, packed full of features (and also built in cheats) as well as rom hacks. Truly a great emulator and worth the purchase.
known, for, this, I love this app so much Ive decides to become a beta tester to help improve bugs, glitches, and crashes. Some will inevitably crash. Sonic: the dark brotherhood is known for this on Android. Here's to fixing that

changed, to, Pixel, It's a good app absolutely. But it does not work anymore after I changed to Pixel 5. The file browser has broken and is not able to browse any file.
ilove, at, work, Best emulator ilove this app lot my frends at work are jealous
using, for, years, I've been using this app for years, love it. I can't recommend it enough if you're looking to play some good old DS games. I hope the devs can include wifi play some day tho if at all possible
work, on, Google, Lies nothing works looked up how to get it to work on Google this is a scam give my money back
scan, for, games, Can't even scan for games. App just freezes
find, in, app, DraStic is one of the best emulators I've ever seen and I was blown away when I finally got it working but unfortunately I have to give it one star because on Android 11 I'm unable to set the ROM directory or change games from within the app. The only way to load or change games is to find them in another file manager app and to `open with DraStic`.

sdcard, like, emulators, Can't navigate to sdcard like other emulators.
paid, for, this, I paid for this but there is still ads? Thats stupid
ruins, for, event, Nearly the best DS emulator for Android I've ever used! Button layouts can be personalized by game, there's a pop up menu that allows access to numerous ease of life functions, such as saving/loading, game speed changes, and even control buttons and touchpad disablers, without needing to access the settings panel. Only reason it's not the best is the lack of the multiplayer functionality other emulators offer, really ruins it for pokemon trading/distribution event emulating especially.
play, on, that, it was awesome on my android phone, so when i got a chromebook i wanted to play on that to, but no games will load, they just send you back to the menu, really sad about this
search, for, games, Won't let me search for games
came, off, it, Enjoyed it until saved my game, came off it and it didn't save. Thought this was my fault then the exact same thing happened again, absolutely fuming to be honest
Used, for, years, Broken!....Used Drastic for a good few years and always thought it was a good emulator with nice features. Tried playing today, can't now scan phone for roms or navigate to find them. Totally useless at this point!

set, with, stick, I wish I could set right joy stick as button inputs like I can with the left joy stick. Currently can only select joy stick modes for right stick.
fits, with, layout, edit: just dled this emu again since I've gotten myself a Microsoft DS™ (Surface Duo) and the dual screen fits perfectly with the emu's layout. Unfortunately you have to manually adjust everything yourself and there are some instances were some of the options in setting is hidden between the two screens. I own a surface pen for my Duo but I need to buy a Razor Kishi to complete the setup when I play games like metroid prime hunters lol. Worth it!!

upgraded, since, review, I've upgraded my phone since my last review to an Android 11 with internal storage only. It was not read any files. I followed someone else's advice in reviews: move your roms or thr folder with your roms to the root of your storage, potentially /storage. Once I did that it read the folder and I was able to continue and actually play and game. Besides that my intial review still stands: Don't bother with any other emulators, as Drastic runs 100% even on a low end phone.

move, to, folder, $5 and the app does not recognize roms. Does not matter if they are zipped or not. Online shows to just move them to the drastic folder and you are done. Not the case, these are good roms i transferred them from my pc emulators to my phone.

play, on, phone, This is an amazing emulator! You just download the ROM you want to play and open the app and it works! No configuration or anything. If you want to play DS games on the phone, this is the app for you.
search, for, roms, Cannot search for roms to play. Please fix
Crashed, on, Ultra, Crashed several times today on my S21 Ultra. Latest updates. Unfortunately there hasn't been an update for this app since 2020...please update before I'm not able to even use the app I paid for.
map, to, folder, used to be my all time facorite with great features and smooth game play. but since the android update I have not been able to map to my folder and there doesnt seem to of been any movement to find a solution to this
worked, for, hour, Beware this app is fickle worked for like an hour before it stopped reading the rom
Works, like, charm, Works like a charm. A dedicated screenshot button would be very nice
works, to, me, Very good emulator works fine to me 💯
appear, in, gen, A really good day emulator, def worth the cost. Funnily enough, the black dots that normally appear in gen 4 in other emulators disappear here (one of the perks). BUT some wifi/internet support would be nice

play, in, app, I love this emulator I get to play the old pokemon game *sigh* good memories and best thing in this app no ads 😁
rely, on, card, It runs great, haven't had a problem while playing multiple games already. Rating 3 stars because it doesn't allow me to choose games from my SD card. That's a big deal because my phone doesn't have much storage so I have to rely on my SD card for my ROMs. Edit: So I found an app that helps drastic to read ROMs from SD card. So bumping to 5 star cuz still an awesome emulator. But hope it gets an update so it's able to read from SD card. Edit: Mic don't work on games that requires it..

happened, with, game, I recently used the custom cheat codes but now that I try to input a new custom cheat the game force closes and I can't put the code in. It has happened with every game I tried it on.
work, on, pro, Works on my OnePlus 7 pro like a charm. Doesn't work on my OnePlus 9 pro. It won't let me browse for a game directory.

use, from, searches, It's pretty reliable and nearly zero effort to use aside from small searches to learn about, say, some settings do. I do notice it is somewhat finicky with resuming a game, sometimes taking a few attempts of tapping Continue or Start Game, as it occasionally crashes a couple times upon start. Once it's going though, zero problems. Mic is a hit or miss for some reason too, so probably avoid like Nintendogs or get a workaround cheat code if possible. Excluding a few tech hiccups, cool beans.

ran, with, money, SCAM, DO NOT BUY. Abandoned app, awful developer that ran away with the money after failing to deliver features. Support doesn`t exist.
work, on, note, Doesnt work on my note 10+ android 11. Can't even browse the file on my phone to find the game. Have tried reinstalling, re allowing the permission, etc

do, in, pokemon, Great app, I just wish the devs would add a link option like Myboy so I can do trades in pokemon
works, on, me, works fine on me.
save, with, option, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but whenever you try to play a game after closing the app, "continue" option is always greyed out. I save with both the option inside the game and the app itself, but it never actually does save, it's like disliking a YouTube comment.
assign, to, game, Best emulator by far. Could you add a feature to be able search the cheat database and assign cheats to a game such as ROM hacks or when cheats aren't automatically detected. Adding them one by one through custom cheats is tedious. Love everything else about this emulator though thanks for creating this amazing piece of nostalgia for us.

lost, so, mind, Sometimes glitches out but I've never lost progress so ion mind it, takes a while when selecting a new game, but besides all that, I absolutely love playing the games I used to play on my NDS :) thanks for making it possible

crashing, on, note10, It keep crashing on my note10+
seeing, as, update, I'm sorry to say that this app just doesn't work. I have a Samsung Note 9, android 10, and I haven't been able to make this app work at all. When it was android 9 it worked, but seeing as the last update was over a year ago, I'm not holding my breath for a new update. Specifically, I click load new game, the screen dims like it's loading something, then the app crashes. Nothing I do fixes this, even a complete reset of my phone.

Used, for, years, Used Drastic flawlessly for years. But as of Android 11 it no longer functions. A search online shows that they aren't responding to any help threads either. Do not waste your money on it.

insert, into, cheats, I really used to love this app. That is until the app became frustrating to use. I would insert a cheat code into the custom cheats and the code wouldn't load properly. Another issue is that some of the cheats that were already programmed into the app don't work anymore like they were intended to. If these issues could be resolved I would truly appreciate it.

stumbled, into, problem, Hey guys I love this app but I have stumbled into a problem the arrow at the bottom of my game (pokemon black 2) seems to have gone for good so I can no longer drag up the menu to savestate and I have the manual save bug where it says I cant save over my file blablabla.. I want to play other games on the app but I don't want to close it as It will only give me the option to open my last save can anybody help me please?

access, On, android, this emulator works perfect. The only problem now is.. it cant access my sd card anymore where my roms are at. Using Miui 12 android 11... On android 10 it can access the sd card... I hope this gets updated coz this emu is really great.
fixed, for, emulator, Very good emulator had fee minor issues with crashing but nothin that's hasn't been fixed great price definitely worth it for those wanting emulator their phone
see, to, load, Was the best DS emulator, but I'm now unable to see any of my games to load. Latest update didn't fix the issue with the file browser. I have a Pixel 4a 5G on Android 11. Rom files are in main directory, as that is the only place available on my phone.

use, by, Bluetooth, The emulation is perfect, you can use any external device by Bluetooth and filter the resolution to get an amazing graphic experience, obviously, you haven't the double screen and that's the only problem
drop, into, DEVICE, Android 11 Users: This app DOES work, but you need to drop a valid NDS ROM into your MAIN DEVICE FOLDER first, then navigate to the folder where the rest of your ROMs are at. Will rate higher once the storage system is updated properly.

sharing, across, devices, Works well for most purposes, but I can find no trace of the actual save files and customer support has been unresponsive. This makes sharing save files across devices very annoying, especially since I also can't simply tell it where to keep and use save files.
restart, on, game, Waste of money. The app constantly crashes and never saves, the calibration isn't right so the buttons never work and you can't use the touch screen, the custom clock doesn't work and it doesn't read all games. I had to restart on every single game when I transferred phones because the app didn't recognize that the files were there and I couldn't change the folder destination.
work, on, Ultra, Abandoned. Doesn't work on my S21 Ultra. I can't find the games on my phone because the menu to search for games does not let me browse.

crashes, for, app, The emulation performance is great, but for an app that costs 5$ it sure crashes a lot. Like at least once an hour. On both my Galaxy note 10+ and my chuwi hipad x. I keep losing my progress in Pokemon black 2.

runs, at, FPS, BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I have a Samsung A21 which is a kinda mid to low range performance phone, but this is the first emulator I've found where pokemon platinum runs at intended FPS and doesn't crash every 90 seconds, Drastic somehow squeezed the extra performance out lol. Completely worth the money.
nullify, from, menu, Works well, has plenty of options. I mostly play sticker games which are great in the touchscreen, the emulator lets me hide the controllers and nullify the buttons, all from the quick menu which has all the most convenient options at hand. Couldn't ask for more in a DS emulator for mobile phones.

Made, in, 2014, Made my first review in 2014 and forgot to ever update it. Love this emulator, I get to play all the pokemon games I never got the chance to growing up! Had to change my rating :)
map, to, directions, I only have a couple of nitpicks: 1- You can't map buttons to directions of the right analog stick on a controller, which its a bummer because there's some games where it'd be handy to map the camera controls buttons (Usually L and R) to pushing the analog left and right. 2- You can only map 1 physical button to each of the emulated controls, which its also a bummer, because even if the first nitpick was fixed, I'd have to swap between mapping L and R to the triggers and analog back and forth.

showing, For, anyone, Great ds emulator. For anyone having storage issues were it not showing your games on external sd, just move your roms to internal memory and reinstall drastic it reads them then. This is an error with android 11 most emulators are having this problem some are fixed this 1 isn't.
using, without, cards, For those of you who are using phones without SD cards, android 11, or those who are getting the blank games list issue please note all you have to do is make a folder within the base directory of your phone. Example is I made a folder called Ds roms in my "internal memory" area. Then booted up the app and bam. My games all work. Phones are different meaning of this doesn't work try moving said folder around until it does. Thank you for a wonderful app. The BEST DS app on the market worth $5.00

concerned, with, stuff, I'd give it a 4.5 stars but I'm limited to 4 stars. Everything about this app is perfect, I'm not souch concerned with multiplayer related stuff. One minor concern is adding a gyroscopic controls mostly for driving games. Maybe it could be enabled in the Controls settings and toggled in game. It might not matter to me because I play mostly turn based games but others might appreciate it.

stream, because, APP, Amazing emulator. Even includes full bluetooth controller support. I use a ps4 dualshock. I even stream DS games because of this awesome APP
test, on, speed, Emulation quality is good, settings lack depth, like I want to test my fast forward on speed 110% but I can only choose intervals of 50% so something that it could do I simply can't because there's no setting for it, some settings are separate from similar settings seemingly arbitrarily, for example the on screen controls settings do not contain the settings for the placement of the on screen controls, instead they are in a separate menu outside of the settings, with many more problems alike

broken, on, devices, This application is broken on many Android devices. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A SCAM.

open, from, expoler, Great emulator probably the best DS android emulator, but I got a new phone and now it won't open games, either from my file expoler or in the app
go, through, files, I loved this app until I got a new Samsung galaxy a32 and can't even go through my files to find and play games. Glad you took my money tho. How do I get a refund?
spending, for, app, this emulator is nice, being honest here its more worthy spending $5 for this app than getting free emulator, and DrasStic also included the cheats on it so you don't have to copy it from other websites, no issue here everything good, highly recommended

get, in, opinion, Probably the best you're gonna get in my opinion. Would be 5 stars but sometimes the controls can be weird. Also save states
play, on, it, Works really well, I only play Pokémon on it so I don't really have any of the button issues I've seen in other reviews. But it runs smooth and has lots of settings so you can customize it to your preference. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there's no trading or multi-player ability like the My Boy or My Oldboy emulators. Kind of makes certain games a little less fun. So if you guys figure that out then I'll be happy to give you 5 stars. Aside from that, great emulator!

had, so, this, Have had no issues. I never had a 3DS when I was a kid so this for $5 has made games super accessible. And the cheat database is quite cheeky.

scan, for, games, Can't scan phone for games
play, on, it, 100% worth the $5. I was hesitant at first to buy it, just because I wasn't sure if it worked well, but I thought 'why not, it's just $5, and if it works great then I'm happy'...so I got it. Works amazingly, I can play my two favourite games on it! I'm sad there's no multiplayer but if it gets added in the future then I can't wait :)

Feels, like, yesterday, I get to play my childhood games like Pokémon. Feels like yesterday. Thank you developers.
m, on, chromebook, it cant even play anything because it doesn't want to open it im on a brand new chromebook
switch, between, gamepad, EXTREMELY counter-intuitive. To arrange the screen layout you have to load a game, then open a unique menu, then arrange everything. If you want to switch between gamepad and on-screen controls, (since, you know, I'm not carrying a God damn controller everywhere I go) you'll have to redo your whole layout each time you switch from one to the other. Emulators for other consoles don't have problems like these why are NDS emulators so frustrating?!

point, to, game, Currently unusable, I can't select the directory to point to a game. Please fix it.
working, on, it, This app is the best for DS roms. The only drawback is lack of multiplayer/wifi functionality. However, there is a multiplayer/wifi button in settings so I'm hoping the developer is working on it. Worth the $
ask, for, more, Absolutely love this app. Plays games just fine and is easy to use. Couldn't ask for more.
search, for, games, I want to use it but I can't search for games on my phone.
has, with, animations, This program has issues with animations sometimes and I experience constant crashes. I wanted to pay for it because I thought I would get a better product. Obviously that's not the case. I do not recommend this program

comes, to, PC, Most accurate emulator that exists (hopefully it comes to PC someday), but recently I've noticed an issue. I moved my games to another folder, so within the emulator I have to change directories, yet there is no option within the settings to save directories. Every time I open the app I now have to dig past various folders to get to the 1 with the games and it gets annoying.

Playing, on, ultra, Great app. My only current complaint is that 400% speed up is the highest option besides unlimited. Playing on an S21 ultra its a bit of a pain because 400% is a little slow but unlimited is way too fast. Would love a middle ground. Besides that it's perfection.
owned, since, 2015, I've owned this emulator since 2015, just buy it. No free emulator on android is gonna be good enough. Features include background and button customization, built in cheats with the ability to add your own, controller support, shaders, etc.

restart, from, save, Save states do not work at all. If you exit the app it freezes and you have to restart, usually from last save. No speed up options for speed contr
navigate, to, files, Drastic will not recognize any roms either in my phones internal storage (Note 20 ultra 5g) or in the installed memory card. The apps file directory does not allow me to navigate to any files or folders.
display, in, played, Like the emulator cheap. But now it doesn't recognize my files s20 ultra or scan can't find them. I have to use the dig app to get it to open up and will then display them in recent played! So that helps for a way around it

point, at, directory, The browser is broken. There doesn't seem to be a way to point the emulator at the right directory.
test, on, phones, I test this emulator on 2 phones and it impossible to use because when I pres load nothing happens , any folders doesn't open .
reported, to, Play, Tried app again. Paper Jam, Pokemon, Zelda, Smash bros and about half a dozen other titles downloaded. None work and the app cannot even find the unzipped versions. Uninstalled AGAIN and reported to Google Play for a nonfunctioning app. Proper file formats for the app. I had to download a few games multiple times to find the right file format. None worked. Bye.

link, through, bluetooth, Great but is it ever gonna be able to link through bluetooth or wifi with other players?

continue, with, quest, I'm playing Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and I'm crashing when using thunder and hitting more than 2 targets and when the giant bird use its rushing ability and I can't continue with my quest and my progress in game, but everything else is top notch in performance.
Tried, on, devices, It was a dream until one day when it no longer recognize my storage. It is unable to laugh any games now. Tried on 3 different devices and the problem is unavoidable.
take, on, phone, This emulator is awesome! If you have a large NDS collection this is the emulator you need to have so that you can take your games on your phone. You can adjust the graphics to look better the NDS. This is a must own emulator. Worth the price.
allow, After, opening, After the initial opening of the app, it won't even allow me to select a file path for my roms. The file explorer portion of the app simply does nothing once I tap it and I haven't been able to find a workaround. Was a great app before all this.
mapped, with, keys, Lacks major updates. Xbox Series X Controller R2 and L2 can't be mapped with special keys.
lost, due, nuances, Almost perfect, wish I could play multiplayer Mario Kart. Not sure how that could be made to work. Other than that, fantastic. I've had basically no issues, except with some savestates being lost due to some nuances I didn't know about with pokemon games. They're finicky with all their save files. Best not to ever save in-game unless you are required to for some reason. If you do you cannot go back, unless you basically delete everything. Even savestates saved on google drive seem to disappear.

click, on, anything, Freezes at main menu when you click on anything. Also needs 3ds emulation
having, with, control, Ive been having issues with button control and the bottom screen not wanting to touch. I havent had any issues until recently so i dont understand why this is happening.
works, on, Nord, It no longer works on my OnePlus Nord N10 5G, I cannot select any roms because the storage is broken for the emulator. Nothing shows up in the file browser. Edit: fixed it, love the app. Great work.

stuck, on, storage, Was working great before but now it doesn't scan my phone anymore to find any games. It's stuck on the storage with no option to move between folders. I have no idea what's happened to this app as it was amazing but it seems to be a common problem by reading other people's comments. Stay away from this app until this bug is fixed by the developers!

delivers, on, lot, Was sceptical about actually buying this, as there are free alternatives. Still gave this a try after not being satisfied with the others and, it's VERY well worth the purchase. Where other emulators are ad-riddled and perform poorly, this emulator just works right out of the box and delivers a smooth experience, probably even on a lot of devices with lesser performance. UI is clean and understandable, settings aren't overwhelming but still let you do a lot. Thanks for this!
hope, for, emulator, Best NDS emulator you can find. I hope for a 3DS emulator by Drastic soon, I can't wait to finish playing my favourite trio from Nintendo and their story lines (:

access, For, starters, I loved this emulator 3 years ago. Now it's bad. For starters, I cant access my roms easily and when I finally can access them after hours of searching it wants me to download a suspicious app that I've never heard of and suspect to be malware. Exophase, please, I beg of you. Make roms easier to access. Please Edit (8/8/21): about a year later, they have apparently seen my review and acted upon it. 5 stars.

work, on, phone, The app use to work fine on my previous phone but now on my new phone Asus ROG Phone 5 the app is unable to scan any of my games that I own.
navigating, through, folders, The emulation per se works nigh flawlessly, but the "load new game" option has started to cause some problems by failing to autodetect the folder and locking me out of navigating through folders.It gets stuck on "/storage", where there's only a ".." item that does nothing. Highly annoying issue. It should just let me pick a fixed folder (and start the explorer at /storage/0/emulated) instead of trying to autodetect everytime.

playing, with, friends, just a amazing ds emulator which is really worth to buy but I really miss online feature like playing with friends
display, on, screen, If the game is being played vertical, it doesn't display on the whole screen, the bottom part either has the touch buttons taking up that portion or it's just empty black space. Would be nice if the game can use up the entire screen like a actual Ds. Most ppl use a Bluetooth controller anyway, so having that option would be nice. I reached out to the developer so we'll see. Love this emulator by the way, it actually runs perfectly.

agree, with, u, I agree with space exploration agency u should add a multi-player thing so u can battle people online like real life players and friends and be able to friend people would be awesome to explore the game together and fight each other to see who has gotten stronger like instead of just starting off with those friends in the start how about it adds to real life players with u for your first friends to get to know each other and grow stronger and just see where they are on map or to see each other.

access, in, phone, Hi, I can't access the game in my phone since I updated to android 11. Please fix the problem ASAP
progress, past, point, Some games just crash right after saving and can't progress past that point I don't know what to do
using, for, years, I've been using this emulator for years, and it's one of only two emulators I've ever happily paid money for. It's pretty flawless, and works brilliantly for mainly touch screen games like Professor Layton, Ghost Trick and Phoenix Wright etc. You can also connect a BT controller for other games, and everything I've tried on it works great. Awesome app.

offers, for, portrait, Pretty great emulator, no ads (as expected), runs smoothly, and so far no issues besides the usage of mic. If you don't have to use a microphone for what you want to play, then you're good to go. This emulator offers great customization/mapping for both portrait and landscape modes. It doesn't include any multiplayer options, however that should be expected for an emulator. It even offers its own cheats for some roms which can be fun to play with. This is by far the best DS emulator for Android.

It doesn't include any multiplayer options, however that should be expected for an emulator. It even offers its own cheats for some roms which can be fun to play with. This is by far the best DS emulator for Android.

located, in, memory, It doesn't detect the rom files located in the external memory
access, in, Android, Can't even access file system in Android 11. Broken app.

using, for, while, Emulator itself is good until it stops working because you have a good phone. After not using it for a while on my s20 FE, I wanted to come back to it only to find that the in app file explorer is not showing anything and I can't open my rom through another file explorer as this app doesn't show up on the list of supported apps for some reason. On top of all this, the website where I'm supposed to report any bugs doesn't work for another unknown reason. If you have a Samsung phone do not buy.

crashes, with, roms, crashes with patched roms plz fix
wish, over, years, Definitely a five star experience but over the years of playing this app, i really wish it had WIFI connectivity
plan, on, games, It's a great DS emulator! Unless you are playing a game that requires the microphone, the emulator is having problems registering anything that involves the use of said microphone, Legend of Zelda: phantom hourglass has THAT one problem that does require using the mic on Eddie to try and get the salvage arm as cheap as possible which makes it impossible since it requires the microphone function. Other than that, if you plan on playing games, play the ones that DO NOT USE THE MICROPHONE FUNCTION!
crashes, to, screen, Everytime i go to start a game it crashes to a black screen. I know rhe games work because I play them fine on Super NDS but just bought this for the better features and fast forward. Waste of $5

do, for, mobile, Very good emulator, worth 5 dollars. No ads, good frame rate. Controls are a little annoying sometimes but it's the best you can do for mobile I guess, so I connected it to my PS4 controller and works fine, the only problem with that is that the ABX and Y buttons don't have a bind for my controller meaning I can't use those buttons. I would really appreciate if this was fixed in the future.

broken, after, update, This used to be the best ds emulator but after the last update it is now broken. Now you can't load ROMs anymore.
worked, without, issue, Fantastic emulator, and the only good one on Playstore that doesn't crash often. Had no crashes, the video quality is great, performance excellent, and each game I got for it has worked without issue.
updating, to, Android, After updating to Android 11, I can't load Rom even I'm only using my internal SD, the fullscreen option (the option that ignore the notch) seems to be broken with the app

trade, between, files, Really good emulator. Everything is smooth and runs good. I use the Myboy series but they don't have a DS so this is good. One problem. The multiplayer/wifi system needs to be added. As a pokemon player, it would be great to trade between game files. As an advance wars player, it would be great to fight against my friends. Certainly could use that. I quite literally say this would be perfect with the connectivity, there is nothing else I could say for improvement.

go, to, screen, Overall, the quality and experience deserves 5 stars. It's a perfectly functional DS emulator for Android, without ads or any major UX issues. However, recently there's been a problem where the app will freeze if it's in the background for any reason, which means you'll lose progress whenever you accidentally open another app or go to your Overview or Home screen. It also means you have to save the game every time you back out to check a wiki.
find, in, person, It's a wonderful app. It is the perfect application that allows you to play old games that you can no longer purchase or find in person because they're out of date or other reasons. Maybe it's just me but sometimes it glitches and crashes so when I press game A instead of playing game A game b turns on instead. A bit of technical issues but could be my phone or the file. Sometimes crashes as well and shows game glitches when too much of speed forwarding is used. Other than that a it's perfect.
Made, during, time, Played pokemon white v2 for over 2 hours. Made multiple saves during that time. Only to close the app and come back to a blank game with no saved progress. How irritating. How can I trust this app for anything else?

process, in, this, Not even going to lie this is an amazing emulator. It speeds, has cheats, and the roms are very easy to process in this. This would be a 5 star app if it wasn't for one thing. Sometimes, after I save the game and leave, and when I try to load it again, it will crash a few times. It's just a minor annoyance, not anything big.
Works, with, games, Amazing Nintendo DS emulator! Works perfectly with all the games I have tried in the past and present. It's definitely worth more than the $5 I paid for it. Pokemon Black 2 runs flawlessly on it and even with frameskip off the games run smoothly. Great App!

select, At, time, Almost perfect! At this time, on Android 11, I cant select the SD card though, and if you go up enough in the path, the path can get stuck with no coming back, cause you can only go up but it doesn't have anywhere to go, and from that point you can't select internal or external storage. Please fix this bug.

scale, to, screen, Does not scale the game to my screen properly. Would love to actually use it but neither landscape or portrait mode work properly with attempting to press buttons. Was trying to play some Castlevania but its kinda pointless when I have to tap so far off the buttons to make them work. -Posted on Samsung Galaxy note 10+ 5g-

happen, with, version, Drastic won't detect my sd card where i put all my DS games. This didn't happen with the previous version of drastic and its really annoying to keep DS games on my internal storage since it only has a small storage.

runs, like, dream, This emulator runs like a dream. Can it also support internal audio for android 10+ soon too?
work, as, WiFi, A very good emulator, and worth the price..maybe the best on Playstore! The only complain i have is about the backups on Google drive not work all the time, and so bad WiFi don't work as WiFi and multiplayer. Otg cable gamepad work good, and all games with high graphics..Keep up the good work Ps. Not working with Android 11, until they update this, I don't change my 🌟

access, due, system, The emulator itself works great and runs most games flawlessly. There is built-in cheat support and the app comes with it's own cheat database. The only issue is with Android 11 users, the app cannot access any files on the Sd Card due to Android 11's Scoped Storage system. Hopefully a update to this app addresses this. In the meantime I have to copy over my DS games from my SD card to Internal Storage.

pop, on, phone, Freaking fantastic emulator. I was considering buying a Nintendo DS to relive my childhood games, but instead I bought this app plus a mobile controller. I'm so happy that I can pop up my makeshift Nintendo DS on my phone anywhere. I highly recommend this emulator, you won't regret it. :)
open, on, app, Phone: Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 8/128, Snapdragon 732G. DraStic automatic game scanning doesn't work. Searching manually also doesn't work, permission for files and data are already allowed, but the search manually on internal storage doesn't work. Trying to open manually on File Manager app also doesn't work, it doesn't have DraStic as a choice to open the app. Please do fix this. What's the purpose of me paying this app if I can't use it?
flip, on, L3, My favourite DS emulator. The ability to flip screens (toggle) on controller L3 or R3 is so cool. I wish there was support for multiplayer, the options are there but nothing works. I'd give a 100 star review if you manage to get it up and running. 😉
have, in, phones, -edited review- it works fine but in newer phones you have to put your games in the internal memory and its kinda tricky. 3 stars for the lack of support. . --old review-- i never bought an application before but after trying the best "free emulators" and reading a few forum reviews i decided to give this a try... i was not disappointed at all. Heil Kirby!!!

share, with, children, Emulator works great gaming experience is great however after purchasing the emulator I joined my wife's Google Play family library and I am unable to share this game even though I've already purchased it. I would like to share this emulator with my children on their tablets however I am unable to. Any information in regards to this would be great.

asks, for, permission, Every time I open it, it asks for permission for my storage but I can't click allow or deny; it just doesn't respond. I am on a Moto G Fast with Android 11.
needed, for, games, It is a great emulator for those who have the files needed for the games. Also those files are easy to find online if you do not currently have them.

listens, to, voice, Great App. But a weird blue light at the bottom of the screen as i play, kind of looks like when you ask siri or google and it actively listens to your voice. Kind of weird and don't know what it is. Would like an answer!!
reccomend, to, gamer, Games run beautifully, would definitely reccomend to any gamer who doesn't own any DS hardware.

booted, without, hitch, Phenomenal emulator. I haven't had any bug's, performance & graphical issues. All the games I've tried booted up without a hitch. It runs as smooth as melted butter, endless customization, graphical and performance options. Truly an amazing product! Costing only $5 ridiculously cheap! If you're a ds fan and want to bank on nostalgia or a random looking for more games you can't go wrong with this emulator. High recommendation!

play, without, issues, I love it, no errors like other emulators and allows me to play my games without issues

built, in, codes, Easily the best ds emulator so far with built in cheat codes for games if you so choose. Without the hassle of setting cheat codes up. Not to mention ease of bluetooth pairing controllers.

Works, with, controller, Very good app. Works with ipega Bluetooth controller.
switch, between, views, Best ds emu I've personally played, and I can't imagine ds emus get any better than this. Works exactly how I want; I'm able to quickly switch between various views of one or both screens in realtime and it works great with my sn30 pro+ 8bitdo. Bought this for 5 bucks on a whim. Probably the best 5 bucks I've spent on a long time.

recognize, on, Android, Will not recognize SD card on Android 11.
optimized, for, phones, Only emulator thats optimized even for old phones like Samsung s2. Yes this is worth buying, it also has cheats for neatly all games.
access, to, files, I cant access to the files to load de games. It's blank. Help please
scan, in, device?Well, Why it still cannot scan the file in my device?Well, until it's fixed, i will give back 5 star. Cuz it's the best ds emulator so far.
recommend, for, anyone, This is hands down the absolute best DS emulator I've ever tried, it's more than worth the price asked and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants an emulator for DS.
Broken, on, Android, Broken on Android 11 can't get access to SD card Galaxy d20 fe
does, so, load, The app has full permissions on Samsung Galaxy S21 + but the load game function does not work. The up folder button does nothing so no roms load. What is the default folder I need to put the roms in?
access, on, android, Great emulator, but can't access sdcard on android 11
add, to, buttons, please add a global setting to disable virtual buttons and another setting to globally disable touchscreen.
paid, for, this, I forgot I paid for this, but I'm so glad I remembered. I almost downloaded one of the buggier free versions. NDS isn't bad in a pinch, but paid emulators are higher quality for a reason
taking, into, account, With a Bluetooth controller added, this is the best DS emulation experience I've had, by far, even taking PC solutions into account. Only inconvenience I can think of was one out of 4 ROMHacks I downloaded keeps crashing, I personally find it really minor, and the rest of the package more than makes up for it, but it's something to keep in mind if it's important to you.

found, on, android, There is a bug that emulator not found my sd card anymore on android 11
heard, from, folks, I would 100% rate this app 5* cause its 100%, if not 1,000%, times better than SupwrNDS emulator, but I have heard from several folks that at some points ones own save files will suddenly DISAPPEAR!!! It is very odd, love this app tho cause it hasn't happened to me yet, don't doubt it that it will happen tho tbh.

look, for, emulator, When loading a save file, something happened and it messed up every thing and pretty much I couldn't play a rom that I was playing and it ended up playing another rom and couldn't get it to play the one that I want. Even when I deleted everything and reinstall the game and that game only, it still played that game that didn't choose. Untill I figured out what is going on. I would look for a different emulator and if you use this one be careful when loading up a save file.
added, due, fact, This app did pretty well for me money well spent but the reason I added just 1 star due to the fact it stopped working after time passed

having, with, library, It runs great. But with a huge library of ROMs and my phone not having enough storage I keep all my ROMs in my SD card, and Drastic is not able to read from SD card. Edit: found and app that helps drastic play games from SD card. But hope it gets update so drastic itself can play from SD card.

stretch, on, screen, Love the emulator, but I wish I could shrink the controls size. My hands hurt way too much from trying to stretch on a big screen.
choose, on, device, EDIT: Original comment is still true, but a work around I tried is to put your games inside the Drastic folder(which should be at root) in a new folder called NDS. Before you could choose the directory (on my old device at least). ORIGINAL: Cant select games from storage!!! Entire app is useless!!!
search, for, games, It stoped working, I can't load any games. It doesn't allow me to even search for the games in my storage
crashes, on, S10, Still crashes on S10
have, on, folder, THE BEST DS emulator out there and worth every cent. Can you guys make a 3DS Emulator as well? I am willing to by that in a heartbeat. So totally worth it!!! Edited: Guys can you add a Browsing Menu for searching up games? Seems like it gets stuck on finding the game menu part, if ever you dont have it on the same folder where the drastic is found.
load, on, Android, Needs to be updated so that it can load ds roms from the sd card, on Android 11 and above. Apart from that it works perfectly.
purchased, on, phone, I purchased the emulator on my samsung phone but it wont work on my other device. You have to repurchase, with THE SAME GOOGLE PLAY ACCOUNT! which is complete bs!

work, on, A42, App doesn't work on Samsung A42 5G, choosing any menu item freezes the app.
fixed, in, order, It was working fine but now it won't save any of my games progress. Hopefully it gets fixed in order to give this app 5 stars again. I have a note 10 plus.
crash, with, warning, It's a really good emulator, but save your progress often bc it can just crash randomly with no prior warning.
load, from, card, Still no update in forever. Can load my games from my SD card anymore. I'm using a Galaxy S20.
look, v, good, I downloaded this bc I thought the interface would look v good on a Samsung Z Flip. Nope, its looks terrible. To the point that it looks too irritating to play. Refunded.

use, for, use, Ok.... Beta nor normal versions allow me to use my SD Card for game playing use on Android, until this is fixed, 1 star.
list, as, option, So this app is apparently broken now. It won't read the internal memory or the SD card. I'm on a note 20 ultra. Even when I use a file explorer and select "open with" DraStic isn't even list as an option. Also it runs itself in the background after you close it for no reason. Now I have no refund option. Never even got to load one game. Bye $5.

tap, on, it, It doesn't work. It literally shows a black folder and nothing else. You can tap on it and it glows blue but nothing else happens.

happened, to, app, I don't know what happened to this app I've had Drastic for 6 or more years now and only recently, I've had an issue where my games don't even start The message it pops out is that the memory reset failed and I can only play a couple of my titles, and even in those titles I can only use savestate since the save option is blocked It may be an issue with my phone but I've tried deleting and reinstalling and it didn't work A shame since this emulator was my go-to for years

sped, in, games, Seems to be running sped up in 4th gen pokemon games & has some strange visual effect show up some times, using a Oneplus 7 Pro.
launching, through, shortcut, Pretty good. Although sometimes it crashes when I boot up a game on my new Galaxy A02s. It can only be circumvented by launching a game through a homescreen shortcut.
keep, in, mind, This product does infact work with the Android 11 Operating system, I have an Android s10e. As far as controls and control displays go, there is an option for full customization on a global and game based level so keep that in mind. I came over from retro arch and although retro arch is good the ds touchpad is a bit awkward to use. This is a step in the right direction. NOTE: I have only used both programs for pokemon games.

rate, for, fact, So, I would rate this a 5/5 if not for the fact that it doesn't hold saves. It used to in the past, but now, forever reason, it won't hold in-game saves which it highly recommend you do to prevent losing data.

run, on, devices, I've tried to run Pokemon platinum on other devices with this emulator and it would run so slow and now it's running smoothly on my current tablet so far. Acer Iconia tablet. Cost me around $150. This app is totally worth the money if one has a device that can handle the games. :)

play, with, earbuds, This is by far the best mobile DS emulator I've tried, even better than some on the PC. My phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and it runs incredibly smoothly. I've never noticed a problem with lag or crunchy music, which is a big plus because I like to play with earbuds. I was hesitant at first to spend money on an emulator, but it was absolutely worth it. I just wish that there was a way to do multiplayer.

run, without, hitch, This emulator has literally never let me down. I use an LG Phoenix 4 phone, so not the best chip or graphics or anything, yet every single game has run without a hitch. Not to mention all the user options! You can choose different filters and so much stuff! This is the best DS emulator on the market, definitely worth every penny.
had, for, years, No longer works. I have had this app for years and it used to work perfectly. I have just installed it on my S20+ and I am no longer able to browse my storage to load my ROMS. The app no longer works at all!

My tablets is only a year old and is pretty close to best of the best and it suffers this problem. If they can fix these flaws, this app would be perfect and should demand a higher price
built, in, database, It works really well, has a great save and load feature, and who can forget the built in cheat database
run, on, it, This app is amazing! It's easy to navigate through and games run smoothly on it with little to no frame rate drops. If you want to revisit some old Nintendo games but don't have a DS then this app is for you!

emulates, about, anything, I love this app. It emulates just about anything I need it to fairly perfectly (granted it's mostly pokemon but still). If you are someone that was getting a hankering to replay some of those old ds games you wanted to play, give it a shot here. Just make sure you don't go to any sketchy rom sites, that's how you get a virus (yes even on your phone).

seems, after, update, So after some Android update it seems like Drastic will no longer read ROMs off of my SD card. Lots of people seem to be having this issue, the fix for me and many others is to move your ROMs to the internal storage.

add, for, purpose, The main problem is that the microphone is really hard to use. However, only a select few games use it, and if you do need it there is a way to add a button just for that purpose. I highly recommend this product expesuly if you want to play the da zelda games.
Works, on, hardware, Fantastic emulator! Works great, even on my mid range hardware, and it plays all the games I want it to. I only wish the multiplayer functionality existed.
Ran, on, S5, Flawless! Ran well on my Samsung Galaxy S5 then, runs well on my Galaxy S21 now. You can even improve the graphics compared to an actual Nintendo DS.

crashing, with, effects, Would love a fix for Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift. It keeps crashing with various spell effects. I've gotten 130 hours played on it (with fast-forward feature) and I've found ways to use save states to change the AI and avoid certain spells, or to add a 9-frame manual skip which sometimes skips enough of the spell to not crash. But now I'm fighting a pivotal boss fight and can't get around it crashing.

used, for, years, I used this app for years. Loved it. Now I cant even search for my roms. Just sits at root directory and cant navigate to roms at all.

fast, at, %, This app is too old. If you want to fast forward at all, do NOT buy this app. When fast forwarding, you have the option to fast forward at 200%, 300%, 400%, or unlimited. On 400% or unlimited, I have absolutely 0 frame drops, but at 200%, I can only play at literally 6fps. Turns out the app forces you to frame skip at 200% and 300% to make old phones work, instead of just giving you the option. All that to say, despite having a premium flagship phone, I can't fast forward unless I play at 10x.

got, from, app, I got a virus from this app
navigating, on, g9, Touchscreen response on this app barely functions both in game and navigating the emulator's menu on moto g9 plus
load, from, explorer, Need help! Just redownloaded the app and I cannot for the life of me find the SD card. If I load a game from another explorer (not my files) it works but still doesn't find my SD card when opening the app. This is so annoying and would appreciate any help. I have a s20 plus of that helps.
read, on, phone, Doesn't read the storage on my phone despite having permissions so unable to laod anything
lost, because, crash, 2nd time trying to play any game on here and lost all my save data yet again because of a crash
broken, since, Android, Pains me to put only 3 stars, it's an amazing emulator but SD Card support is broken since Android 11 — no update in a year...good luck for the fix!
playing, on, phone, This DS emulator is spot. I bought it out of curiosity and I saw my brother playing DS on his phone I'm like how. He told me about this emulator to be honest I'm just playing Pokemon. It's a great emulator

spent, on, this, Ok I may consider changing this if my problem is solved but the app won't download its stuck on pending and I spent money on this so
built, in, cheats, Plays every game I've tried flawlessly. Save states and built in cheats, what more could you want 😃
appear, in, drastic, Was very disappointed after paying for it only to find that it wouldn't even let me play any roms. When I click load new game none of the roms I have in my storage appear in drastic. All I see is all games and recent games at the top, and a folder icon that I can't click on underneath. I've tried everything I can to fix this and I finally found a way to play roms with this emulator. You have to download a file explorer app called ZArchiver and run the roms through that. For a paid app, not good.

Closes, on, me, Closes on me when I try to start a game, but always work the 2nd time I load it. I get a message about it closing randomly which happened few times but found a DiY fix somewhere on the web. All in all, its an okay app. But it DEFINITELY doesn't compare to Fast Emulator (A.K.A. MyBoy, a gba emulator,) and I 100% DEFINITELY dont reccomend paying for it. But its what I paid, just not at the quality I expected. Not bad, just needs a decent amount more work.

make, For, developer, For the developer: please make possible to use external SD card so I don't have to load all games on the internal storage. After installing and trying all the other emulators on the Play Store and trying the demo version of DraStic I decided to buy it. It's absolutely the best and fastest DS emulator for Android. Would be nice if WI-Fi support was enabled and also a better management of save states, beside this it is perfect.

payed, for, version, I just keep getting unknown error -24" and it just won't install I have a note 3 it was fine on my old s3 please help I love this app and I payed for the full version :( will give it full stars if fixed.
go, to, folder, Can't load games. When I click "load new game" the app only show "emulated" and "self". When I clicked "emulated" it showed empty list instead of folders like in file explorer so I can't go to the folder where I placed my games and I can't find "self" in file explorer therefore the app is useless. Tested on OnePlus Nord N10 5G. It used to work great on my old phone. Hope the dev can fix it soon.

add, on, it, The Best NDS emulator out there! But I'm kinda curious will they add 3DS feature on it?
put, on, screen, Works well, great emulator, just wish there was a way we could move the buttons where we want, they more often then not cover the screen making touch screen games harder or near impossible to play or when a game has buttons and touch screen it's annoying when switches between the two. Also, if the button to reset the game was quicker to get to/able to be put on the screen. I for one like shiny hunting and having it there/having a more customizable overlay would make things alot more enjoyable.
appearing, despite, data, The 3rd special button is not appearing despite clearing data, reinstalling the emu again... It does appear in layout editor, but nowhere else can I find it in game, despite me trying to change the settings one by one to test out what cause this

add, for, pRiVAcY, Android 11's new "Scoped Storage" is the reason why this app cannot access SD Card anymore, they add this useless feature for "pRiVAcY fRiEnDLy", they really ruined all emulator apps because of this feature.

works, like, magic, THANK YOU. this app works like magic.
fast, at, percent, Runs games perfect, the only reason it's not a 5 star is because the fast forward seems extremely laggy no matter what game or settings, when set to unlimited its perfect for fps but way to fast at 1000+ percent, but if I have it set to any of the set speeds like 200, it feel choppy and not smooth at all

work, due, update, Used to work perfectly but it doesn't work anymore due to the Android 11 update. My roms don't appear and there's no way to browse for files anymore. I hope it gets fixed soon. I'll update this review if it does.

Worked, for, while, Worked fine for a while but after an update a few months ago it's constantly freezing
love, on, tablets, It's great. The gameplay is nearly flawless. Kids love it on their tablets. Even better if your phone has a built in stylus for certain games. Only problem is no Wi-Fi multiplayer support. If you can update with that or even a Bluetooth connection I'd give it a 5.

Keep, after, update, Keep crash after update. Fix it 😑
got, After, update, After update to android 11 the apk got bug on the menu button and touch screen too..
paying, for, emulator, At first I thought "no way I'm paying for an emulator! I'd just buy a DS!" But oh BOY am I glad I took the chance. Customisable user interface down to each button and screen placent, not to mention the best emulator I've used, possibly for any console. Other emulators are choppy, mess all the textures up and make the music sound like it was made by someone with no sense of rythym, but this emulator is as good as the original as were ever going to get. Just buy it, trust me

edit, for, emulator, Just wasted my money, I bought this emulator just because I can edit the screen sizes, for a D's emulator on a phone that's really helpful. HOWEVER, the app is unusable as out of all my ROMs, only 2 appear. Nothing in the settings to scan folders or directories. Hopefully someone can help but from the forums and Google it seems like a update needs to happen

having, over, all, Was having fun over all playing Pokemon white 2, but then once I made it to mistralton city and to board the plane, the screen goes black, yet the music continues to play, so I can't make it to lentimas town, unable to progress in the game. I've tried several times, along with disabling any cheats I have on, thinking maybe it was part of the problem, but nothing worked, so I'm stuck in mistralton city, unable to continue.

used, by, far, Best ds emulator i have used by far. Has close to no bugs and is smooth even on my old lenovo v7 phone.
got, on, FIRE, This literally got 60 fps on my KINDLE FIRE (yes you can get Google play on Kindle Fire). That thing only had 1 gb of ram and it still delivered. I now use it on a much better tablet and still get 60 (obviously). Overall, I am very pleased and am very thankful to whoever developed this.

end, for, you, Nice. Don't install roms from unsafe sites though. Could end somewhat badly for you.
access, sd, card, Please add support for android 11. :) My other device can't access sd card. Thank you. :)
built, in, cheats, Very nice for the price easily plays the roms and has some built in cheats for that extra debug feature, very nice
working, with, games, It is not working with games that it previously played before. I have save data and everything.
expect, in, emulation, Darn near Perfect. No trouble what-so-ever getting set. Has all the features I've come to expect in quality Nds emulation. Only problem is getting it to properly function with an Xbox one controller. Wish there was a button mapping process, big time. Would be 5 stars.

end, on, screen, The emulator itself is fantastic but there seem to be some compatibility issues with nova launcher. Everytime I exit the app it sends me a crash report and I end up on the stock home screen. Kinda irritating but not a deal breaker in the slightest. Edit: this app is perfect
spent, on, app, The best NDS Emulator on Play Store, no crashes so far, money well spent on this app
run, on, phones, drastic can even run on low end phones. devs really deserve my money.
Send, On, phone, I like it But sometimes when you quit your game it Send you Back to the home screen On your phone...
Looks, like, this, Use to be my most used app on my phone until the most recent update. Now I can't access my roms on my SD card. Looks like this is something that's been known for months but the devs aren't doing anything to fix the issue. Such a shame :\

connected, to, all, I tried to get some pokemon games but the black file thats supposed to be connected to all of your files does not work for me. When i tap it it flashes blue then nothing happens idk if i have to jail break my phone or something to get it to work but i have tried every which way with the 5 videos of tutorials ive watched that all show "load new game" with the black file connecting to all the other files on your phone working with no problem, but for me it simply doesnt.

move, from, folder, Bug on locating roms. Can't move from storage folder.
work, like, joystick, Please make the dpad work more like a joystick. The cluncky dpad makes games like Pokémon a real pain
defaulting, to, skips, Best emulator. 5 stars when you patch the speed up feature so it can use full frames instead of defaulting it to 6 frame skips.
rearrange, on, fold, When I try to resize and rearrange the screens on my fold 2 (perfect phone for da emulation) the moment I save the edited layout, the two screens snap on top of each other at the bottom (one covering the other). Unfortunately unusable, had to refund

move, past, homepage, Update broke ability to load game. Cannot move past homepage.

needs, Without, doubt, Without a doubt the best ds emulator on mobile, however definitely needs more features and customizability. Also sorely needs feature to move joypad and buttons.
runs, on, hardware, Works well, runs games at acceptable speeds, even on low end hardware!
paid, for, app, I don't Recommend this Emulator. I paid for this app but i experienced so much error during the game. it always crushes when you load saved games, i even reinstalled it still same problem. i only used it for a couple of days. im so disappointed. sorry!!

need, at, time, Runs well on the Retroid Pocket 2. Saves settings per game so I can vertically stack games that need both screens and hotkey swap those that only need one at a time. Converts certain key presses to touch presses where needed. Excellent and accessible quick menu.
take, to, long, Very useful there were a couple parts of the menu navigation that took trial and error to figure out but it didn't take to long
sourced, via, retroarch, Apparantly going to be open sourced via retroarch but honestly It was worth every penny
working, for, reason, Stopped working for some reason no longer loads after you hit load new game it will crash and no fix for it yet, tried uninstalling and nothing.
using, for, years, Been using this app for like 5 years, never once had any type of problems. And they come with cheats too

Stopped, after, update, Stopped playing roms all together after a rcent update...
built, for, game, Nice Love that it has built-in cheats for any game
Worked, on, Android, Worked good on Android 10 and below no update from Dev for Android 11

READ, with, permissions, WILL NO LONGER READ MY SD CARD even with permissions. Tried the network reset trick and everything and it still won't work
Works, for, me, Works fine for me
work, after, update, Doesn't work after android update
mess, with, settings, Could stand for some ads being removed but as long as you don't try and mess with settings ur good lol
buy, on, store, 1st and last thing I buy on the app store. The most important part of a game is the save state, and this useless app crashed and overrited my savestates so I lost all my progress... Got ripped off. By the way I give it 0 stars It os just not possible
bought, on, account, Brother bought it on my account. Can I get a refund
detecting, on, card, As of Android 11, Drastic is no longer detecting files on an external SD card! Please update your app!
going, to, folder, * I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S20FE I don't know if it's because of a recent update or what but when trying to load a game the file explorer shows up blank. the only way I was able to play one was by downloading an external file Explorer app and going to my ROM folder to load the game. (The default Samsung file explorer won't work because you can't manually pick an app to open an associated file type. It tries to do it automatically otherwise it tells you to download from Play store)

waiting, on, fix, Usually great, but either Android 11 or my new S21 or both means it keeps crashing, waiting on a fix
fix, for, 5star, Used to work perfectly now doesn't read storage. Pls fix for 5star again
Works, like, dream, No loss in frame rate. Works like a dream.
opened, After, days, Won't let me open any games on my note 10!!!!! After a few days it finally opened my games. 2 days later it won't open them again. What a garbage app it was great before.
finding, after, update, Anyone having issues with drastic jobs longer finding roms after last android update, go in to settings / apps / drastic / storage and clear cache and clear data. Then it will rescan for games

run, With, Android, This is one of the best emulators out there. With Android 11 and Sense 3.1 the app won't run hope a update is comming soon

Used, since, 2019, Works great. Used Drastic since 2019. Still good
runs, ds, games, This runs ds games well i like it
browse, to, ROM, I wasn't able to browse to my ROM even though I had permissions set to allow it.
's, As, someone, I really like this emulator. As someone who is terrible with technology, there's something nice about it just working without me needing to change the file format and all that. It's easy to control, responsive, and works really well

trying, on, S10, I'm trying it on S10+ and it straight up crashes when selecting another folder
used, in, months, Christ is the anti piracy annoying. I haven't used Drastic in months, mostly because every time I want to use it I'm riding the subway and it won't let me use it due to no Internet connection.

runs, unlike, emulators, This emulator although its not free it is the best mobile emulator there is, it runs smoothly unlike all the other emulators I've tried.
moves, at, speed, If you're debating paying the 5 dollars, don't, while other emulators are stuttery and slow, this emulator moves at the speed and quality of a ds, and it's extra features don't slow it down 10/10
use, like, melonDS, The definitive DS emulator for Android. However more updates and optimizations, and options would be nice, along the ability to use your own DS BIOS like melonDS. As a side note, the bluetooth audio streaming for hearing aids (using the Oticon Streamer Pro) is so painfully delayed and low quality. Youtube and Instagram doesn't have this problem.
change, to, start, Can't load games off of my SD card now and I don't like having 10 gigs of ds games on my phones internal memory because that adds up. Please help and I'll change to 5 start
Played, for, hours, Played for around 25+ hours so far. Everything works fine. The app never crash. Not once I ever ran into any major problem. The touchscreen works really well, never expected that from an emulator. 5 bucks for an app that work well like this is amazing.

load, since, update, Cant load games from storage since new update. Galaxy s10
paid, for, this, I would have still paid for this even if it was 5 times the price. That alone you can tell how satisfied I am. But something happened that I just noticed recently, I am unable to press 3 buttons at a time. I was trying to activate a cheat code but I can only press 2 buttons at the same time. Am I missing something?

goes, to, background, One of the maybe four apps I liked enough to buy. So stable, never had an issue. Save state updated whenever it goes to the background which is a must for phone multitasking. Good performance even on an old motorola phone. Able to customize controller layouts PER GAME. It just works.

play, from, childhood, It is great. It allows me to play the games from my childhood.
works, with, Bluetooth, Stable and works great with a Bluetooth paired PS5 controller. Fantastic work by the developer.
starts, On, roms, Horrible now. On almost all my roms it starts like it's going to play then says ds can't read game file and to restart the ds. The same roms read fine on other ds emulators. This used to be the best but apparently no longer.

stops, After, update, After Android 11 update, it stops reading my sd card.
lost, in, game, Just lost all my saved states, in game and in app. Have wasted days playing a game only to lose all my progress, I frequently save too so its not like that was the problem.
read, on, device, Doesn't work at all. I gave it permission to read the files on my device, but it doesn't allow me to read either internal or external memory.
