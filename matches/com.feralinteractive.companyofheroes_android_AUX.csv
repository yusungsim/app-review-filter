am, user, android, i, Awesome game. But annoying simetimes if i order my troops to attack or being attacked there is some tendincies they are unable to move when i need them to back a little bit or hide another positions. I always resort to tap RETREAT in order my unit to survive, nor died in action specialy when controlling TANKS or VEHICLES the FACING POSITIONS are unable to function sometimes, i am android user, Poco f1.
's, game, nice, It, It's nice game I loved it ,but unfortunately there is no online play multiplayer
been, fan, huge, I, I've been a huge fan of the game, it's very fun and exciting on the pc as well on the mobile. There are 2 things i would suggest: 1. Pls add a ui scaling feature because on mobile phones, the bottons and hud are blocking 60% of the screen 2. If possible, add a 60 fps feature I'm so happy that this is ported to the android platform
is, game, fleshed, This, The Best Squad based Game on Andriod. This is a fully fleshed out game, true to its pc port. I can't believe they were able to port this on Android..

's, one, best, it, yez it's expensive for a mobile game but it's the best one I played, it's got decent gravies and really easy game mechanics to use, it's super fun addictive and it's not pay to win, best straits game I've ever played!
is, small, little, Everything, Amazing game. Runs well on pixel 4 XL and pix 6 pro. Controls, especially grouping, take some time to learn. Real time strategy but much appreciate pause, lol. One suggestion: Everything is a little small. Maybe drop some elements, like map?
is, game, best, This, This is my best strategy game I ever play! All same like pc. graphics, interface, gameplay, all. Thank you so much guys you did the really great job to release this game for Android users. And I am hoping that you will release the 2nd part of this game soon. Best regards
is, game, great, It, I bought this hoping to play it on my tablet s7 or s6. It is great game I am excited to see it come out at a tablet Platform or for a chrome book compatible game. Please look into these as options as most people play these games for the immersion. Small phones are not ideal for these games. Think about Rome total war, how many people really play it on phones besides just the kill time. Most probably play on tablet out of comfort and the ability to feel immersed
's, conversation, good, It, It's a pretty good conversation from the PC version to a phone. Fun game. always has been.
is, strategy, best, This, I play pc version alot.... This is the best mobile strategy I've ever played!!!
is, strategy, mobile, This, I play pc version alot.... This is the best mobile strategy I've ever played!!!
was, RTS, favorite, that, I love this game it gives me the same feelings as halo wars 1 did and that was my all time favorite RTS! I love that you can have this on mobile the gameplay is very griping and there is a bit of sadness that you feel when a man goes down and dies. At least for me I was like... That was one of my men and that was my fault. Over all the game is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see what the devs do next. Personally I should love to see the campaign go all the way to Berlin.
's, coh, same, It, It's company of heroes but for your phone I've been playing the original since 2007 I'm also in the company of heroes 3 alpha. It's a bit awkward to play I'm on an galaxy S8 it runs fine no crashes but controls are bit awkward mainly for reinforcement, construction and squad management. It's just same old coh but no multiplayer just ai skirmish yeah literary just coh1 but mobile.

is, game, great, It, It is a great game at its core. The controls are a bit flawed but that's in part due to mobile, perhaps a tablet would make it better (using Samsung a52) Also had no issues playing even tho it says it might be trouble with this phone. For the price, the amount of detail, and in depth mechanics you get this is a great game. One of the few games that are actually good for mobile.

is, game, great, That, That is great game one of my favourite game🙂
's, game, full, It, It's the full pc game from 2006. It's a good port, controls aren't too bad, would probably be better on a tablet due to size. Definitely playable . Played on S10 plus

's, game, great, It, It's a great game and excellent port! My only question is if there's chance that we're going to have the tales of valor?
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game been a fan for years but please add a Italian and soviet dlc that would be really cool and I believe a lot of people think that will be cool to .
was, install, bad, it, Cant even open the game! Refunded after 10 attempts. Played it on the computer really hoped to play it on my S8 which says can support the game. (Edit) Purchased again yestersay to see if it was a bad install and its finally working. Yay!
's, game, hard, It, The game itself is great, ran well on my Oneplus 7 pro even though its not officially supported. Graphics and fps are good for mobile, if you follow the tutorial it's pretty easy to get the hang of it. It's a hard game so expect to get beat if you haven't played an rts before. The issue, for me at least, was the size was to small. Even with my glasses, after 30mins I was suffering eye strain. Refund was painless, from Google play. I'll stick with the pc versions. Would work better on a tablet.
is, purchase, first, this, As a recent game design program graduate from VFS, I bought this game to study how to implement PC strategy game (specifically the control part) to a mobile device. I think Feral studio did a wonderful job of making the mobile controls intuitive. Additionally, this is my first ever purchase of a game on through the app store. Do I regret it? Hell no. I am just impressed that we reached the age that our phones have the capacity of playing PC games. Please keep up the great work!

is, creation, loving, it, Utterly amazed that my favourite PC game of all time is now on mobile. The power of modern technology. Controls are a bit wonky but it is a loving creation and a joy to immerse yourself in for hours. Just don't expect esports level gameplay 😂
's, port, great, it, I'm still getting used to the controls but it's a great port overall. I hope a multiplayer feature is added in the future though
's, fun, much, it, Only 4 star cuz when I bought this game and played it it's so much fun but my only problem is that why is the additional files always disappearing and I have to download it again and again to play the chapter
's, game, good, it, Very good game, runs well on mobile and has a good tutorial. I would suggest adding multiplayer. But apart from that it's a good game. If multiplayer is added I will change it to 5 star.
's, control, awful, it, What a waste of money it's awful control and I can't play at all on phone I need it on PC...
be, game, best, It, Please, add multiplayer mode! It will be the best game on Android!! Love you guys! Please add multiplayer!!!!
's, game, involved, it, I've always loved CoH but I haven't played it for a long time. When I saw this was coming to Android I was buzzing! I've played a few levels and it's just as good as I remember it! The controls aren't good, they definitely take some getting used to but anyone who played it on PC will know it's a very involved game with lots of detail and it's tough to take over to the phone - but I doubt they could have made the controls any better. Please bring out the expansions ASAP! EDIT with DLC I'd give 6*
be, game, best, this, If online mode should be added this would be the best Android RTS game by far and possibly for years to come.
be, factions, more, their, Great game, I need a bigger screen but that's not the game it's the hardware! Question for Feral, will their be more factions introduced? EDIT: Opposing fronts just came out, how's that for timing, lol
is, game, cheap, This, Feels like the real coh game on pc. Wait. It IS THE REAL GAME ON PC!! I remember playing this on low settings on my run down pc back in the day and lo and behold even after downloading the hq pack for this game it still looks and feels like I'm playing the low setting game on my pc. Put in multiplayer and I'd be satisfied by the cost. This isn't a cheap game you know.
is, port, excellent, This, I have played this game for hours upon hours on PC. This is an excellent port to mobile and a great RTS experience. If you enjoy strategy, war games and RTS, this is the game for you. This truly is the PC game for mobile. Beautiful work and with every dollar spent.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game I've enjoyed it alot so far but you can't skip the tutorial if you do you'll be really confused
is, game, actual, this, Wow... this is really impressive. I've only done the tutorials and a skirmish but honestly I'm really happy. I can't believe that all my favourite old games are now on my phone... this is the actual game. 👌 honestly I've played 100s of hours on my PC and I'm definitely gonna be on this a lot. You been a bad boy Adolf, and now you shall pay!!!
is, game, only, This, Really stoked feral made this happen! Tutorial is a must even for 10+ year veterans of the game. Only thing I would like to be able to tweak is the ui it's takes away from a beautiful game. Maybe opacity and or no gray background just some options like that. The finger controls are well thought out, but a pretty good learning curve after a decade of mouse play. Thanks! This is the only game I can say that it is now 15 years old and still sits in my top 3 favorites games.
is, game, favorite, This, Wow just wow, this game IS AMAZING. This is my favorite game and I am so surprised that this game was added to android. I really enjoy the game and the controls can be hard at first but when you get used to it its fun as hell. I also want to mention is that you guys should add the British and Russian faction and a few more maps for 8v8 and 6v6 and add snow maps. Also please add coh 2 but overall this game is AMAZING :)
's, port, bad, It, It's not a bad port of the first game but it really needs some optimisation, getting my troops that can only shoot a certain angle to the angle I desire is tiresome and cannot be done at the speed this game needs. Unless it's optimised for mobile then it's not worth anyone's money.
's, game, phenomenal, it, Update: I just deleted my original post seeing how I'm able to get into the game fine and play it fine on my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5g even though when you start the game it tells you the phone isn't supported well it is and after I finally got to play the game and get somewhat familiar with the touchscreen bedroom instead of the PC mouse version I'm living the game . Period end of story it's a phenomenal game especially on a high end phone so just download it and try if you have my phone
is, advantage, unfair, it, I downloaded and was running no problem. I noticed that even on the easy level it is extremely unfair advantage. I must say this game is very unfair and no one likes to lose all the time. I'm very unsatisfied with the game and I wish I would have never purchased it. I have noticed that the developers don't seem to care, because all of their responses are almost exactly the same. In my opinion, it's not worth the purchase!
is, company, real, This, CoH on mobile. Yes please This is the real company of heroes. Not the fake stuff you usually see. Great port, great controls, nostalgic. Great RTS
'm, fan, massive, I, I'm a massive fan of COH but I'm very disappointed with this version , it's so clunky on a phone and it's just near impossible to play as it won't let me rotate the camera properly , will it ever be ported to tablets ? I have a tab S4 and would love to see if it's any better I'm not going to get a refund because I want to believe that this wil ll get better. I hope it does anyway.
'm, fan, huge, I, I'm a huge fan of this game cause I'm wait so long since COH are gonna release at mobile. I'm also playing at my laptop even drop by cybercafe to playing this game. Hoping this game update make others friends to join, with HD, add other alliances to participate besides only this two alliances.Control a bit difficult but they guide to use, sound are good and the rest system roles game awesomely.
is, replica, exact, This, This is an exact replica of the game done right on mobile. Thank you for the work your team has done to bring this to mobile. I do have one question. How do I access unit specific upgrades like a flamethrower for Engineers, or mg42 for Grenediers, or 50Cal for Sherman?
is, game, great, this, Nice game i want ask for you ..this is great game,i love it..but why no british..
is, game, original, It, Company of Heroes for your phone!!!! It is great. It is the original game intact for your phone or tablet. So great it hurts. However there are some things keeping it from being a 5 Star ⭐ that may change in the first but as of now may be big issues for some. 1. Graphics and performance are dependant on you streaming vs downloading the maps and upgraded visuals. 2. Multiplayer did not exist when I purchased and may or may not come. 3. There are 2 control schemes. The default "mobile" is bad.

is, port, solid, this, Touch controls are weird for someone who's used to the desktop version, but this is a solid port of the original.
be, game, good, It, It can be a good game but there so many issues with it for one I cant download any of the required downloads. I've even reinstalled it and it's still not working. You guys need to fix this issue.
is, adaptation, phenominal, This, This is a phenominal adaptation. Only issue is the zoom levels on a 4:3 a screen. But im probably an edge caae here. LG dualscreen. UI kinda loads first, then sticks to how it loaded even if the display changes. But yeah. Controls are as good as youd get for mobile. I enabled double tap to move cause i kept fat thumbing movements, so some options like that...
is, game, mobile, this, Another amazing pc port from Feral. Game play is great. I always felt this game was ahead of its time. If any rts fans are on the fence, this isn't some garbage mobile game. Worth it. Can't believe you guys took 2 of my favorite pc games, Rome total war, and Company of heroes to mobile. Can't wait to see what you guys bring in the future. But if anyone is listening I would love to see Medieval total war 2. All my gaming dreams would be answered.
's, game, fun, it, It crashes a lot on a Pixel 2 and doesn't include expansions but hey, it's a fun game so it's worth it?
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but oh man the crashes are sending me insane. I'm at the point of asking for a refund. Pixel 4 XL. Crashes on menus, crashes in the game. Getting ridiculous.
is, game, nice, It, It is a nice game.. however, I don`t understand why it doesn`t support the new flagship phones like my Note 20 ultra.. I am pretty sure the gaming experience would be way better.. please support more devices!
's, game, full, it, Its real!!! I couldn't believe it at first I thought it was a scam but it turns out it's the full game. I have wasted so much of my teenage years on this game and now I can do it through my phone as an adult.
's, port, great, it, So, it's a great port. But I have one concern... The minimaps and camera angles are changed from the PC version. It's very disorienting when you're used to the original. Not sure why Feral did that... I'll happily update to five stars if this can be fixed. Right now it's fun, but it's hard coming from PC as a veteran CoH player due to the view default changes.
's, game, favourite, It, It's always my favourite game. I can't believe it's possible to play it on mobile. Graphic and controls are great. Nostalgy. But one thing is missing: multiplayer. It's planned in future? Thanks.
is, experience, amazing, This, This is an exceptionally amazing jaw dropping experience. To be honest I never thought my favourite game of all time would ever come to android because of all the different hardware types on the platform. But Feral really are the best at what they do. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+ and I have absolutely no problems running the game even with rain falling and artillery bursting. Well worth the money. Hopefully they get enough sales to add on the Expansion Packs. Thank you Feral.
'm, mastermind, biggest, I, One of my top 5 best games. Absolutely love CoH. It plays really well on my Rog phone 2. No issues, I use the pause button quite a bit to prep my strategies and give myself time to adjust my plans. May be a bit of a cheat not sure but I'm not the biggest mastermind at strategy games. No faults, no issues. Great fun with a great story. Spent hours playing it on steam and I'll spend hours playing it here. Hoping to see the rest of the dlc packs to pop up like tales of valor!
is, content, enough, It, Hope they will release free dlc for this game. It is not enough content for 13.99. overall is a very good game.
is, phone, cheapest, which, First of all this game is amazing not for the weak minded cuz this game is fun but can also stress you out lol the game does crash here and there but other than that it's good dont listen to the bad reviews they just dont have the best phones to play this game so they give a 1 rating I have a Samsung A50 which is the cheapest phone on Samsung but the game works amazing so I wouldn't believe those people playing this game on a android 07.
is, game, great, this, Now this is a great phone game to have. Please bring more games like this.
is, port, mobile, This, This is a mobile port of a great, tactical real-time strategy game on the PC. As such, at its core it is a fantastic game. The realism and tactical aspect of doing things like maneuvering tanks so that their frontal armor is facing incoming fire to minimize damage is amazing. Sadly, I can't give this 5 stars because the touch screen controls are just not up to the task and imo, limits gameplay quite a bit. If it weren't for that, it's hands down one of the best RTS games I have ever played.

's, game, great, It, It's a great game I recommend but controls are wonky but how else would you cover 30 some keys to a touch screen at first if your not feeling keep keep pushing the controls just take time to learn
was, reason, main, that, Great game, as was expected from the original. Am a big supporter of the franchise and frequently play COH2. Will multilayer be released? As that was the main reason for purchasing
is, game, best, This, This is the best game I been waiting for I love this game and plz plz put company of heroes 2 keep it up 😉
is, title, good, this, I waited for this game to come to mobile for a long time now and I'm not disappointed. Run smoothly at most parts on my Note 10+. However, control is a bit still clunky and cutscenes fidelity is a bit low, I think a setting for higher quality can be beneficial here. And strangely, I get a popup saying my phone is not supported, which is obviously not true. Please look into that issue! Those aside, this is a good on-the-go RTS title for both newcomers and CoH fans.
's, play, amazing, It, It's really amazing game play ,details, graphics, everything I play game in mi mix 2 without lag and bug
be, devs, doable, that, Haven't played this game in a long time but the fact that they got this down on a mobile and it feels just like pc but on your phone with touch controls is awesome If they can't add MPLAYER they should atleast add that survival mode where its you and 3 others defending your base against waves of enemys that should be doable atleast devs I hope you read this and add it.
