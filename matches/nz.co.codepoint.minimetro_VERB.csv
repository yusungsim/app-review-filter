playing, on, android, Looking forward to playing mini motoways on android
get, to, levels, Game is awesome and can be very difficult to get to more levels. It would be nice if game would change colors for levels that have it's challenges met.

play, with, settings, As soon as I change the language, it deletes some of my progress, more and more as I continue to play with the languange settings. Shame on the devs.
working, against, circles, I've reinstalled this game a few times, wishing it would get better, but you're just working against circles without any satisfying resolution. This is in contrast to real life, where creating a subway or transit system DOES have good answers, albeit expensive and inconvenient: There IS a right or best way and it CAN be satisfying, UNLIKE THIS GAME. It contradicts the whole purpose of playing video games to antagonize players without substantial reward or accomplishment for completion.

run, into, issue, This is a review from a new player and I can already tell this is a great and very addictive game. I have only run into one issue thus far - it can be very hard to tell on my small phone screen if a line is attached to a shape or merely next to it. Noticing this too late has caused most of my game overs so far. Could we get clearer a visual indicator of unattached shapes? A dot in the middle? Different color? Idk but this would really help my experience. Thanks!

takes, to, page, The game is not working, everytime I open it it takes me to the play store game page. Please fix this
bombard, with, ads, A fantastic little game that doesn't bombard you with ads, and the gameplay is perfectly suited for a touch screen

get, in, android, This game is super fun when you are into puzzle or strategy games. I gave 4 stars because overall it is a great game but I wish they implement mods like new custom maps like in pc version. I am hoping to get that feature in android and also new maps like taipei, manila, kuala lumpur, tokyo, moscow, vienna, busan, amsterdam, zurich and etc.

leads, to, frustration, Interesting and innovative, but ultimately unforgiving. Takes half an hour to build up a successful map and a split second to bring it all down, which leads to frustration and an unwillingness to recreate an entire map.
explained, for, me, Idk I just didn't get it. The tutorial explained nothing for me and the game was just confusing.
seen, on, android, end ios partnership , this app is pretty good altho i wouldve liked to seen mini motorways on android as i feel its a more optimal experience for a light game as such
leads, to, gameplay, Simple design which leads to thoughtful and clean gameplay, and at a very low price point. Highly recommend
play, at, point, Incredible Very charming game to play at any point in day, honestly i cant wait for mini motorways to get on phone if thats even happening

based, on, theory, Simple yet complex and super fun puzzle-ish strategy game based on game design theory. At first you think it's really easy but eventually your subway system will shut down due to overcrowding no matter how good you are at designing these line based systems. Plus they have a new game out called Mini Motorway which is similar to this but based on car traffic! It's not on phones yet unfortunately.

Liked, of, course, Liked the premise, looked forward to the motorway version, yet of course, Apple monopolised and you sold-hope it was worth it! Thanks for making us android guys feel appreciated

hit, on, head, Basically the perfect transportation game. They hit the nail square on the head with concept...colours...music and sounds...design and so on and so on. Obviously I hope one day there is a full metro game (that can deal with more complexity (peak hours, transfer management, split lines, penalties for rebuilding etc). Great fun game.

made, to, Apple, I like this game but they made their latest one exclusive to Apple and this behaviour is just not acceptable.
allowing, for, pauses, "Engages" the player by going ridiculously fast and not allowing for pauses or breaks or thinking of any kind. There are better puzzle/system optimization games that don't cost money. The controls are terrible and the consequences of doing the wrong action are huge. Also the mechanic of the game ending because the subway is too popular doesn't make any sense realistically.
taking, with, it, Fun but occasionally breaks its own rules. Sometimes a train leaves a full station without taking anything with it, despite heading towards the proper destinations.

label, as, number, Simple design yet so fun , is full of creative can build any type of railway you want. It would nice if the train, carriage, intersection,bridge symbol can be label as number instead of stacking .
press, on, button, Found a bug! When I press on double play button the game goes fast as it is expected to, but the time keeps glitching sometimes its goes fast and other times its stuck and going on a normal pace

played, on, computer, Orgianally I played it on computer for free on coolmathgames then I thought I might be able to have it for my phone(obvisously I was right) but enough with that It is a fantastic game. I just wish you go infintely.

dreaming, about, solutions, Great puzzle games! Worth hours of very challenging game play. I found myself dreaming about possible solutions I could have taken. Very recommended.
playing, for, day, I've only been playing for a day, and it's easily among the very best mobile games I've ever played.
add, to, stations, Lots of fun until there's an issue with the zoom/scroll and you need to add lines to stations outside the visible area of the phone. It won't let me!
payed, for, game, I payed for the game and never got the chance to download it
Fun, for, while, Fun for a while, does get stale pretty fast though.
love, with, mechanics, I can't find anything to criticize. I love the simplicity of the game, with the easy but complex gameplay mechanics, and the clean graphics. You can understand everything going on as soon as you open the game, and it plays very smoothly
chill, after, day, Amazing game! Equally the most relaxing and stressful strategy game I've played before. If I want to just chill out after a long day, this is one of my go to games. Lots of replayability too. Every map and replay plays out differently. Well worth the price. I own it on mobile and PC it's that good!

challenging, at, time, Simple gamplay and challenging at the same time. Enjoyable learning curve.
share, with, Family, Don't buy if you want to share the app with your Family.
drop, on, mobile, Totally worth 99c Just waiting for Mini Motorways to drop on mobile, because the gameplay looks super fun!

zooming, in, makes, This game is absolutely amazing, it's only a dollar too, the controls aren't perfect but zooming in makes that easier, I just love it
like, on, phone, I wish every game could be like this. I enjoy different video games, but on my phone I like simple, logic puzzle games. The game looks so simple, but after a while I realized it's way deeper than I thought. This game doesn't rely on flashy graphics, instead it forces you to think. I love using logic to solve problems, and this is logic at its best. When you start, you have no idea what works, what's supposed to be done, but figuring that out is half the fun. Just experiment to see what works.

playing, for, years, Been playing the Steam PC version for years. I can tell you the Steam PC version is far better than the phone version: 1) Phone version is too small even on a 6.8" screen, 2) requires a lot of zooming in and zooming out, 3) Touch control is horrible if you don't zoom in first, 4) Your finger blocks your view, 5) Drains battery like crazy (and I should remind you your phone could explode if you charge while playing as it gets really warm), 6) You still get sound even after disabling sound LOL! (which is alright as its not as invasive). Other than that, it's a challenging game! The phone version scoreboard is separate from the PC version scoreboard. The phone scoreboard look more authentic; PC scoreboard has lots of cheat/fake scores.
have, on, platforms, I remember this game when it was only an Adobe Flash gameplay test. It's still a joy to play and I have it on multiple platforms. Simple, easy to learn, hard to master! P.S. Bucharest would be a great addition, especially of you add regions where you cannot bridge over / tunnel under, only block.
use, for, days, Whatever. Fine for the first few levels but then doesn't let you advance anymore. No explanation, no suggestions, no hints. You'll use it for 3 days then delete it.
manuever, into, redemption, Still no proper AMOLED black for the interface. Also, game's RNG snowballs too quickly, with little chance to manuever yourself into redemption as things go SNAFU, which means game favors luck over skill. I get it that Mini Metro is all about surviving for as long as you can, but look at how Kingdom New Lands and Two Crowns ingeniously does that. Other than that, pleasant little pick-up game for quick 10-minute bursts.

show, in, Games, Budapest achievement won't show up in Google Play Games :(( ||| Mistakes in Turkish. The second Game Over screen sentence should be something like this: "DD günde PP yolcu metro ağınızda seyahat etti" (DD days, PP passengers). The current one looks like a mixture of two differently worded sentences of the same meaning blended into one: "In DD days days PP passengers moved passengers travelled over your metro network" with unnecessary repeated word. Please check it out!

stuck, on, traffic, Fun game, worth the money. Quite fun and makes the time fly by while stuck on traffic or in a metro line
hoping, in, future, This game is great, always fun for an engaging distraction. I'm hoping in the future they add more modes from PC, but check it out regardless! Edit, well they did it! I thought I updated this sooner, but they deserve the 5 stars, it's a great game! Endless is nice for someone like me who's not too great at the game and it's also good for practice to learn what really works.
crashed, for, months, Beautiful game and now I can finally play it again after it crashed continuously for months.
grating, after, minutes, I expected to love this more than I do, as the core concepts are pretty good. However, there's two significant problems: The music is non offensive but grating after about 5 minutes. They only just added an option to turn it off, that wasn't included from the get go Circles. Yes circles. The game has ridiculous circle spawn chances and eventually stops converting them to rarer shapes, leaving you with a massive surplus of them, generally all in one place too.

did, as, project, I did this as a project for my geography degree years ago (with bus routes). I can't help but think that someone else took a planning class and had the idea for the app which I'm sure some professors might use the app as an assignment. So I can see why this is teacher approved.

pull, OFF, city, I enjoy it very much BUT I used to be able to pull the line OFF a city and now it's not working. Super frustrating so I'm taking a break. 💔
relaxing, at, time, Both deeply stressful and relaxing at the same time
seen, in, game, This game is a clever and challenging puzzle game you aren't meant to beat. The GUI is the best i've seen in any video game and yet it's so minimal that it would go unnoticed by most people. I can't believe i only spent a dollar on this game! It's so much fun!

looking, for, what, Thats really awesome. Thats what im looking for. I love it.
brought, to, life, I have a love hate relationship with this game. I think the game is brilliant in concept: addictive, interesting, basically graph theory brought to life. The weaknesses are how random the levels can be and this can impact your scores. Two high scores may not have the same meaning. The line drawing can be infuriating. Am I trying to move the rain, extend the line, or am I trying to remove a station? They all involve very similar motions.
Love, in, steam, Very nice game easy and still difficult together. And never annoying. Now is the waiting for the mini motorways!! Please make it happen too. Love both in steam too.
play, on, bus, Great game to play on the bus or train when you have no Internet
got, in, it, I like cos it got Melbourne in it
made, with, premise, The best games are made with a simple premise which evolves be become challenging and engaging. This game effortly ticks all those boxes. Fantastic fun!
built, into, game, It's a very very fun train line builder. 100% recommend. It has endless hours of fun built into a simple stimulating game. The complex possibilities are endless. Calming. Chill. Relaxed. IT EVEN HAS DARK MODE!!
has, for, people, I've played Mini Motorways before, which I feel would be better for mobile players, but this game has seemingly difficult controls, especially for people with large hands. I often find myself removing trains, creating new lines, and making existing lines move in on themselves, which creates a frustrating experience. But maybe that's part of the fun.

gets, in, way, The swoop between menus is worth three of the stars straight off. Simple game, gets annoyingly complicated quite quickly, in good way that makes you want to play again though!
gets, after, bit, Unable to turn off music It gets annoying after a bit of game play
send, with, score, Best game for forever play and killing time and when off-line. Great for on airplane or trains. Would be great if you could send a game with score to a friend and challenge them!
work, as, tutorial, Took me a little bit to work things out as tutorial is a bit week but when I did... Brilliant! Its great for people who enjoy problem solving like myself, looks simple at first but can really test you mentally in the end

Works, like, charm, Simple (at first) and addictive fun. Works like a charm.
stuck, for, twice, Meh. Fun, but for twice got stuck in a situation where new stations stopped appearing because the map was full but I never lost the game, even after letting the phone alone for hours. Ended up exiting the map only to realise that score wasn't counted. So you can't be so good that you actually beat the game otherwise your score won't count.

master, among, words, So addictive, very simple but hard to master among other buzz words
involved, in, development, overall quality is good, except for the level design. I feel like there's no level design involved in the development of this game.
see, for, yourself, Easy, pleasing, beautiful. Just a relaxing game, but sometimes... Buy and see for yourself, this game worth every penny
hidden, under, homerow, Good puzzle game spoiled by poor coding/UI. Constant buzzing sound on silent setting, controls hidden under homerow, menus poorly organised. Avoid or be sad at what could have been.
stuck, in, stations, Trains keep getting stuck in stations.
come, to, Android, Will Mini Motorways come to Android? I just saw DangerouslyFunny play it on YouTube and I recognized your design immediately!!

asked, for, refund, Overrated and boring game with drab gameplay. I would have asked for a refund if I did not get it for free.
have, on, android, Haven't played yet but I bought the game to show support. So can we have mini motorways on android now?
do, with, optimisation, Decent game. But man, do something with graphics optimisation. Ma tablet gets really hot. Even in brawl stars it gets less hot.

's, to, it, Waay to addictive... there's a rhythm to it.
try, by, developers, I first got this because I couldn't get Mini Motorist and I wanted to try a game by the same developers. At first, I didn't really understand and like the game, but as I played more, studied up a bit and failed sometimes, I kept getting better and better with each run. For having this game less than a week, it's been a fun ride. If you're having trouble figuring it out, then stick with it. It's definitely worth it.

paying, for, it, I don't usually buy games on playstore. Let me know when mini motorway is on playstore as well, i don't mind paying for it.
used, in, class, This game was used in my Games Design class to teach how to minimalistically teach how to play the game with UI alone. Simple but genius, the sound design especially so.

controls, at, times, Quite boring. Frustrating controls at times. Not as fun as some of the reviews would lead you to believe.
release, on, android, Great game..please release mini motorway soon on android!
come, to, Android, Can't wait for mini moterways to come to Android!
play, in, simulator, Amazing, addictive and simple. Pick up and play in a high-score subway simulator, and try and connect randomly placed and shaped stations popping up all over the map. At the end of each week, choose between more resources to manage your metro and stop stations from overcrowding, otherwise it's game over. As more passengers want to ride your metro, the more difficult it gets to keep up with demand. Easy to play, hard to master. Super fun and worth the money!

keep, with, demand, Amazing, addictive and simple. Pick up and play in a high-score subway simulator, and try and connect randomly placed and shaped stations popping up all over the map. At the end of each week, choose between more resources to manage your metro and stop stations from overcrowding, otherwise it's game over. As more passengers want to ride your metro, the more difficult it gets to keep up with demand. Easy to play, hard to master. Super fun and worth the money!
beaten, in, hours, Definitely a fun game and I enjoyed it as the difficulty increased. It is a pretty short game though and all the levels can be beaten in a few hours. I found the replayability to be worthwhile.
looking, to, Motorways, Great app! I'm looking forward to Mini Motorways hopefully coming out on Android soon! ❤️

WAITING, FOR, MOTORWAY, WAITING FOR MINI MOTORWAY TO BE ON ANDROIDDDDDDDDD
suck, at, it, This game is way too fun, and I suck at it.
geek, over, models, This is a wonderful, *wonderful* game! 😍 It is *definitely* worth the few dollars it's sold for. Just FYI: I'm not into trainspotting and I don't geek over train models. I just like looking at metro system maps. Looking forward to more levels 😉 Bangkok, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Busan, Hamburg, Hangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Nagoya, Osaka, Oslo, Philadelphia, Rome, Santiago, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Taipei, Tehran, Tianjin, Toronto, Vienna, Wuhan, Xi'an...

play, on, transportation, Very addicting. Excellent to play on public transportation.
refreshing, in, stores, For such a simple game to have a complex challenge to it is refreshing in app stores full of repetitive copycat and pay-to-win or paywall games. Initially opening the game I thought it would take up just a bit of time. It has kept me coming back! I had to remove it from my home screen so I'd stop "one more minute" playing. There's always a new strategy to try and the challenges make you see new ways of completing the colorful maze of spaghetti geometry.

play, in, app, Strategy, intuition, attention to detail, real-world experience, and sometimes just plain good luck all play a part in this outstanding app, which ranks among my top five of all time & may actually be #1. Even in my worst outings, this game provides food for thought & a superb design that eschews glitz and cacophony in favor of more practical, straightforward & recognizable visual & sonic languages that successfully compel gameplay while minimizing stress for & even soothing players.

is, in, mechanics, One of the best mobile games I've played. Love the minimalist style and there is a lot of depth in it's basic gameplay mechanics. It's the puzzle game I've been looking for.
lock, behind, deals, Please don't support game companies that lock their games behind exclusive deals. (Mini motorways is apple exclusive)
stuck, with, lines, Very cool game. However, I'm stuck with 3 lines in every city. Even after winning a few weeks and getting a new line as reward, the game isn't making it available.
droning, in, background, The game itself is great. There is this faint sound like a drill droning in the background whenever I play the game. Even when silent mode of the game, I can still hear it if my phone volume is high. Only happens with this game. Using Samsung note 9

care, of, playerbase, What is the point of supporting a developer who dosent really care of his android playerbase. Never going to support dinopoloclub again.
come, to, devices, So first, I love this game. There isn't anything wrong with it. What is wrong is the developer thinks that platform exclusively is perfectly okay. Their other game Mini Motorways will never come to Android devices. This is not acceptable. Don't give me the "oh we've done exclusivity since the 80s because of gaming consoles". It was bad back then and it's stupid right now. If you truely believe that then why is it on PC and soon the Switch? So my review sits at 1 just as you don't care about us

wait, in, level, Is it normal to wait for so long in Hong Kong level for the passengers to appear?
Using, for, time, Using this for a long time. Even if I am busy, I keep coming back to this for a quick break. Simply Awesome.

PAY, FOR, IT, This is an amazing game! I always keep coming back to it! It's a pity Mini Motorways isn't on Android. I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR IT.
play, as, waster, This game is fun, challenging, and addictive. It is one of my favorite games to play as a time waster or for a serious challenge. However having to leave a game with no way to save and continue is slightly annoying. Adding this function would definitely improve the game.

got, On, Stockholm, Fun game. But some times RNG will literally make it impossible for you to continue. On Stockholm I never once after 6 weeks got a single extra tunnel so it was impossible to connect to all ports.

played, for, years, Fun game for any metro enthusiast! Have played this game for years.
emerge, from, rules, Thank you! It is deeply satisfying to see such complex orchestrations emerge from such simple rules. I feel invited by the game to challenge my imagination. I play again and again, not to do better than before, but so that I can try out new ideas and find new interactions. With the simple control gestures, I get lost in a flow of drawing and shaping. The fun of playing Mini Metro comes from the seamless way I get the create and recreate until my figures have mapped out an elegant solution.

based, on, it, Beautiful game!!! I've always had a love for maps and especially maps of metro rail systems and a game based on it is something I always wanted. I'm a fan!
play, on, phone, I like the game the only reason it gets 4 stars is because whenever I try to play on my phone it sends me to Google play It would be nice if you can fix that. Also it would be nice if you added Moscow as a map

owned, on, Steam, I already owned this game on Steam for more than a year. I gladly bought it again cos the devs deserve it.

add, to, game, This is definitely my favorite game ever! It's so relaxing and fun! I remember when this game was at the indie exhibit at the EMP museum and look at where it is now! I do have one suggestion: I think you should add Boston to the game, that would be a challenging map!
gets, for, anyone, I am really enjoying this game so far, have about 3/4 of the maps unlocked. One gripe from me giving it 5 stars, LET US DISABLE THE VIBRATION. If I'm in a quiet area playing, hearing the vibration every few seconds gets old fast for anyone nearby. Please give us the option to disable it.
go, to, it, Love it. Especially daily challenges. If I could change 1 thing - you can tap the achievements icon and see all the achievements earned and those that you may still complete . Wish you could just tap at the "to be completed " achievement to go straight to it. Instead I have to go back to the list of cities, scroll to the correct city and only then can I try to get that achievement.

look, into, this, I used my Play Pass trial to play this game, and I loved it! Finally got money to officially purchase it, and did. There is a major problem however: The Play Store still says I don't own it! Can you look into this? Edit: The problem has been resolved, thanks!
coming, for, one, Perfect little strategic game with a beautiful minimalistic design and an addictive quality that keeps you coming back for one more try to better your score...
saw, at, MoPop, I saw a demo of this at MoPop and this is a great port to Android
was, to, it, I do wish there was a little more to it y'know? Like a little more content or depth to the game, just a touch tho because I do like its simplicity

Acted, during, tutorial, Acted up during the tutorial refusing to recognize drags but after restarting works fine. Interesting game, a nice change.
outlined, with, recordings, I used to love this game, but for almost a year now theres been a bug where the third line you place doesn't pick up any passengers at all. I outlined all the details in an email, with screen recordings to Dino Polo Club, and they never even replied. A bit annoying, since I paid for the game on Steam too, and the same bug happens there too. Was a great game while it lasted, but uninstalled now

connect, Like, others, Like many others in the reviews, I cannot connect stations as dragging doesn't seem to work. I'm disappointed that the developers don't appear to have addressed this issue which obviously affects quite as few users.
deal, with, ADHD, Great game! Helped me deal with my ADHD
connect, between, stations, i love the game itself, but the thing is I cannot connect between stations, with the instruction saying that I have to hold a station and drag it to another station, my game won't allow me to do that for some reason

see, during, game, Very addictive game. Some suggestions: add a Tokyo map. It would be great to see a summary of my lines during the game, like how many locomotives and carriages on each line etc. Also it often forgets my highest scores for various cities.

buying, for, laptop, I love this game, but very shortly after buying it for my laptop it became impossible to compare my daily challenge scores with other players. Now I keep getting messages that the challenges are on maps I don't have, but there is no automatic update and I can't find a way to repurchase on Windows.

Dragging, from, station, Dragging from station to station doesn't work anymore. What have you done?
use, for, funsys, Great to use for funsys
experiencing, with, it, Game is fun, but I have one small complaint and one bug I'm experiencing with it: I agree with another comment I read, the level difficulty does ramp up pretty fast after some point, and the bug is that I'm not getting any achievements into my Google Play Games. Not sure whether it's something regarding Games app settings, or Android version, but I have 0/57 even though I managed to achieve them inside the game, and the app is connected to the game. Edit: it got fixed, and got used to difficulty

looks, in, mode, Remarkable app. Both relaxing and challenging. Really like how the game looks in night mode!
put, into, it, The overall simple, Swiss-esque visual design as well as the amazing sound design of this game helps make it an interesting and thought-evoking experience. The simplicity cloaks the difficulty of making a functional line, and effort and thought has to be put into it. A beautiful game!
got, on, pc, Initially got this for free on pc and decided it was worth getting on mobile. Really shows how you can do more with less.

drag, through, station, This game needs a button to clear all your lines. As the complexity increases you frequently delete all your lines multiple times per game and having to drag each line through each station is excruciating. Furthermore there is an error where sometimes a new purple line won't have a train on it.

snap, to, stations, Very fun real-time puzzle game that gets challenging very quickly! The calm atmosphere and simplified visual style cleverly hides the challenge until it's too late - you're hooked now! I like the visuals that emulate real-world stylised metro maps, and the interface is fluid and pleasant to use. Lines snap nicely to stations and maintain the aesthetic even while you're placing them. I like how different levels have different characteristics, so it doesn't seem like too much of the same.

shows, until, connected, Fun game. If you have problems with the drag and drop just zoom first. The game should auto pause when a new station shows up until its connected. Theres no motive for me not to connect. I also find myself starved for information. Ultimately this game should run on a money system per customer and allow you to buy what I need.

play, on, tube, It's a well designed game and very enjoyable. It's a puzzle game but it is constantly evolving and changing. I like to play it on the tube 😁
spent, on, thing, Painfully addictive! I spent waaaay too much time on this thing.
pay, for, game, Doesn't work. The game seems to load fine, but I am unable to make any connections between stations, which is the whole point. I've tried different ways but no dice. Not what I expect when I pay for a game.
kept, on, phone, Incredibly simple game with deep complexity. It's the game devs' dream. This is the only game I have kept on my phone since I've bought it because it's fun and very easy to pick up and put down. I've been playing this game for years and it still feels like there's more to learn, which is astounding because there's not much to the game on a surface level.

play, on, tablet, I love mini metro, I originally got it to play it on my tablet, but upon downloading it to my new phone as well (a Samsung Galaxy A51), I can press on the stations and the colored ring will appear around the station, but no matter what I do, no line appears and they simply won't connect. I would love to give this game a 5 star rating but it doesn't work on all platforms for me! If there is any way I could get some help to fix this I would gladly update to 5 stars, as it is a wonderful game!

play, without, sounds, Great game! I realy like the gameplay, and the price is worth it since there are no ads or in game payments. So why is it a only four star rewiew then? Well, the music is just bad and it gives me a headace so i have to play without sounds. I would like if you added a decent music, it doesnt have to be perfect, but I feel like almost anything would be better then the current music. Anyway, i realy like the style of the graphics, it realy looks like the subway maps and i like it. Great game! 😀

I would like if you added a decent music, it doesnt have to be perfect, but I feel like almost anything would be better then the current music. Anyway, i realy like the style of the graphics, it realy looks like the subway maps and i like it. Great game! 😀
play, on, computer, Game is very fun and addicting, but buggy. I play it on my computer so I figured I would get the app version for killing time when my laptop is not around. Zoom and screen scrolling are glitchy and jumpy. I thought "oh well, it's just not optimized for phones." Then I noticed pinch zooming and screen gestures were this way with all my apps (especially Google maps) so I thought something was wrong with my phone. Eventually I uninstalled this app and phone is working normal again. Samsung S20+

play, on, phone, I bought this game a couple years back on Steam and loved it. To play it on the phone makes much more sense and its just as much fun. That being said, there is more potential in this game and I would love to see more implemented in the future.

played, on, phone, Originally played this on my phone, which was sometimes difficult given map scale. Am now playing exclusively on a Chromebook, which makes gameplay much easier.The randomness of map generation can get aggravating, but that gives it more of an arcade feel, which is OK. Fun game overall.

Obsessed, with, game, Obsessed with this game! So simple, addictive and satisfying, with beautiful clean graphics. I love collecting the metro cards for all the cities I've been to IRL (Myki! Octopus! Oyster! 交通一卡！) and I love that they have vintage versions of a few cities.

ramps, After, customers, A lot of fun, and the sound is great. After about 500-700 customers the difficulty definitely ramps up though.
Getting, to, metros, Fun and very relaxing. Getting to the big metros is challenging.
Played, since, d.l, Played 4 matches since d.l. and I know this game will be my crack. At least as as mobile goes. 👍🏾👍🏾⬅️ Yeeap, count em up That's 2. Feeling pretty special now are ya? We'll Here's 2 more. 👍🏾👍🏾Nice game!!

Challenging, with, gameplay, Simplicity at its best. Challenging enough, with simple gameplay. Would love to see a few more high score tables ;)
pick, at, time, The rating on this game is waaaaay over rated! It didn't take more than 10 minutes to figure out that this game is bulls@#it. New stations pop up faster than you can earn "trains" "bridges" and "tracks" and than only gives one to pick from at a time instead of giving you both. It's an exercise in futility. If you want to play a game that literally gives you no chance of winning then this is for you! This game is an insult to rational people!
played, for, years, Worth every single cent. I have this game on mobile and pc and even though Ive played it for many years I always seem to come back to it. It's relaxing, its management, its satisfying. The achievments are really doable, bit can be hard sometimes, bit that makes it even better: a bit of a challenge is good! I recommend this game to anyone who likes a chill game.

suck, at, game, I suck at this game, but it's still pretty fun and good to pass the time
Play, on, train, Play It on the train. 11/10
remove, from, tracks, Please add a button to "remove station from tracks" instead of making us have to delete the whole line just to remove a station
looking, for, kind, Exactly the kind of game I was looking for. No ads, simple concept with longevity and variety.
wait, for, one, Great game, can't wait for the 2ND one 👍
feed, into, station, New update made the game unplayable. I can feed trains into a station as much as I want and they wont pick up passengers. I can add carriages to the trains. They still dont pick up passengers. My record was around 1200 and now I cant even get to 120.

Playing, in, it, Playing the game in it froze.. Glitched and would jerk forward a frame then top again. Really fun game... Don't know if it was my tablet or not. Pretty simple game to jam up my tablet.
updated, to, MRT, I hope you updated combined line like LRT to MRT
Filled, with, varieties, Filled with many varieties of problem solving for the multiple places, a lovely game to play! You (if I'm not mistaken) added vibration! <3 Bringing it back to 5 Stars (But most importantly, thank you devs! <3 <3 <3

happening, to, locomotives, I'm a bit confused about what keeps happening to my locomotives... They seem to just randomly disappear. Maybe some consequence of my trying to move tracks away from a station?
built, on, mountains, A disappointing thing is that the new map for Chongqing is quite different from real Chongqing. The city, built on mountains and between rivers, has unique landscape and layout, which are not illustrated well. It can be done better even with the limited elements in the game.

Starting, in, city, Quite an addictive simple game. Needs a few UI improvements though. Starting in a later city means lots of swiping, it would be good if the game remembered which city was last played. It's not clear which week you're in until you get to the end of each week and the game pauses, it would be good to have this displayed by the clock. Exiting the app relies on the Android swipe from the bottom to minimise and close the app rather than an exit option in the menu.

stressing, at, time, Relaxing and stressing at the same time. But a great game nonetheless. Flawless gameplay and creative UI
put, at, time, A mobile game done right! A unique concept that you can put a few minutes or a few hours into at a time. No ads, no in-app purchases. Beautifully designed and difficult enough to frustrate me.
have, on, PC, Really fun game, but gets hard too fast. I have this on PC too and like that one more as it has more features and benefits from a bigger screen and a mouse. I've played this game for years and am just now reviewing this version. In the last 4 months, I've had some issues with achievements unlocking in Play Games. The game notifies me that I have completed an achievement, but when looking at what Google says, it still appears as locked. One for Chicago unlocked recently, but not Chongqing.

build, for, cities, Mini Metro is more than anything else a planning game. You will build a metro network for several different cities, starting from just a few stations and ending up with tens of them and countless interchanges. At a certain point you will always lose, but the fun is about how big and efficient your metro network will become! It requires very smart planning and tactical decisions, but at the same time the smooth music and the ability to pause anytime makes is very relaxing. Great game! 😃🚄

played, on, PC, Fantastic game! Can be nice and relaxing or play different modes for intense challenge. Also played on PC, great there too 👍
kill, during, commute, Nice visuals, interesting concept, I enjoyed this game. Fun way to kill time during actual metro commute.
play, in, parallels, The game is great, but I would really like to have an ability to save and load. This way I can at least play more than one city in parallels
Playing, for, days, Most exciting, boring game! Playing it for days 🤦
engaging, with, maps, Reasonably engaging with unique maps, but the difficulty ramps up way too quickly. You go from being fine one "week" to having multiple stations overcrowding in the next- makes me not want to play when I know I'm just waiting for death. Randomness of end of week spawns offers adds to difficulty/fun, but is annoying when it never spawns the one thing you need. I'd prefer all options so then I could choose, then have specialty spawns for certain maps; ie Berlin only gets bridges every 3rd week.

love, to, it, I love the simplicity to it, it's a puzzle strategy, trying to connect lines to stations and avoid having passengers over crowd them. Very addictive

needed, with, cities, Update needed with less cities and more lines The first three should be Metropolitan in Purple first opened 1889, District in Green which opened in 1892 and Central in Red which opened in 1900 whereas the first three you get currently are Central in Red, Circle line Yellow which didn't opened until 2002 as a complete line and the Piccadilly line in Dark Blue which first opened in 1986 please remove this error as it's distracting my immersion.

playing, for, years, Been playing it for 1.5 years now, thanks to Daily challenge and non-commitment gameplay. Loving the fact that this is NOT a freemium game and the price to purchase at the beginning is really worthy. Please add more cities! Also release your mini motorways here for Android!!!

offering, beyond, look, One of my favorite games that I keep coming back to. I have been playing it on and off for years. I even have the game on Steam as well 🙂 It's a minimalists dream come true. Minimal while still offering complexity beyond the first look. It is interestingly relaxing and then offers up those moments of mad rush when you notice things are "off track" and you need to correct it. I love this game! 👍
look, for, second, Great time-spender but gets overwhelming if you look a way for a second.
get, to, grips, Really fun experience, very easy to get to grips with but hard to master. This has been one of the surprise hits of Play Pass for me.
added, to, game, Great game! I just wish the developers added more features to the early game
had, for, years, I've had this game for several years and I keep coming back to it. Best paid mobile game out there. Simple yet challenging. Aesthetically very pleasing (I love the dark mode). The challenges are enjoyably difficult.
play, on, subway, Disturbingly addictive for such a simple game. Oddly satisfying to actually play on the subway (when the world isn't a germ filled apocalypse).
is, For, example, Beautiful and simple game However it's missing some QoL things. For example, there is no way to delete just 1 segment of your metro, you have to delete the entire line and start that line over. The game also is fond of stretching your tunnel/bridge limits quickly, which I'm unsure if that is just part of the challenge or not, but it can go from easy to impossible very quick.
play, in, minutes, Game is very nice and fun. I learned to play in around 5 minutes.
compared, to, .io, Very cool and original compared to all the .io's out there.
get, past, screen, I love this game but it crashes every time I open it. Won't get past the title screen.
make, like, this, Great relaxing game. Please make more like this.
maxed, in, less, I absolutely adore the concept, but the difficulty ramp is very steep. I have maxed out the game in less that a week. The level design needs work, the appearance of stations is a little too random, and the passenger queue ramps up far too quickly Vs player lvlup. Every level has a cap of about 200 passengers per cycle in eadless and it's physically impossible to get past that barrier as far as I've been able to tell. I hope you do some work on this area, the art and sound design are perfect.

broke, from, update, Game broke from last update. Paris, for example, doesn't always generate a new train every Sunday. Hit and miss. Not sure what changed.

get, past, tutorial, Couldn't get past the badly explained tutorial. No idea what the point of the game is unfortunately. Seems boring 😬
removing, from, line, This game is fun and simple however removing stations from a line can become difficult especially when the map gets crowded.
bored, by, it, Really, really wonderful game. You never get bored by it, and it's truly challenging. Most game developers could take lessons from these guys. Strongly recommended.

optimize, for, efficiency, This is fun for a bit. It lacks any of the tools you would need to optimize for efficiency. Something that tells you what the load on a given station is, or the load on a line, or the number of transfers per shape or line... Just anything to help you see where there are problems so you can fix them.
add, as, map, Very fun lots of play different each time but one request add Los Angeles as a map
code, on, earth, Adrenaline high. Best game i've played👌🏾. It would be really cool if you could include some sinple explanations about scheduling and optimisation in node theory so the lines can be more deliberately drawn and maybe some history of some of the train stations. A bogey mode where some lines are blown or bombed away can add some tension to the game to challenge the user to adapt. How on earth did you folks code for this?? AMAZING!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

soothing, with, options, A top-notch game, both soothing and challenging, with thoughtful options and variations.
pass, by, station, Fun, great game, but the stupid train ai sucks they all ways just pass by a full station even when they have no one on them. Just annoying.
evoked, with, game, What an emotions are evoked with this game. Endless days of pure joy are guaranteed. Sit on the couch with a friend and build your logistical paradise. Epic. Love it. Five stars.

own, on, PC, Most of the 1 star reviews are from people who are clearly too stupid to understand and should just go back to Candy Crush! I already own this game on my PC but the mobile version is a great timekiller and really great to chill out to when on the move. The controls and game play are really intuitive whilst the game remains very simplistic looking.

adapting, to, controls, Loved the PC version. The mobile version is a bit more finicky, as there have been some issues adapting it to different controls, but I still like it very much. Gets a bit frustrating if played too long, but I do return to it occasionally, and enjoy myself greatly, just to put it away until the next burst.

see, on, mobile, A great game. Played it on Steam years ago, glad to see it on mobile.
engaged, Despite, simplicity, Excellent game. Despite its simplicity, its able to keep me engaged far more than any other game on my phone. Each level is unique and not redundant, which is something I thought might be a problem with 25 levels. All in all, an excellent game.
detach, from, tracks, An addictive little game with a clever concept, easy to play but very difficult to master. The interface is elegant and fairly intuitive, although it can be difficult to detach stations from tracks. I love the real world locations!
allows, for, performance, It's a simple to play, just the right difficulty train line management game with sufficient amount of levels and gamemodes to play. Definitely worth a try. The graphics are very clean and simple which allows for very smooth performance.
love, for, that, This game is at once simple and complex. Easy and hard. I love it for that! Don't shy away from the simple graphics, this is a brilliant puzzle.
played, on, phone, This game nailed the balance between simplicity and complexity. I have never played a game on my phone that was this dynamic! Every game is like a serious BRAIN-PUSHUP!
do, about, it, interesting and imersive but gives no hint wheather decisions are good or bad, game also fails to tell you why overcrowding occurs or what you can do about it? so game ends and you don't know how to improve!
say, for, long, It didn't say interesting for long, just the same thing on repeat and it was a bit difficult to figure out how to play the game at first.
boring, at, start, I is relly useful and fun it is worth the money love it I'll start to be boring at the start start to get more fun
Looks, like, fun, Looks like fun but I couldn't do the tutorial. It says to drag a line but that just slides the screen around, I cant pull the line.
comes, to, point, Not a good gameplay because it comes to a point around 30 days where no matter what do you do and what options you choose, it will always be crowded, Idk what I am doing wrong I played like more than 20 times and it always do that.
get, to, kong, Almost everything about this game is great but there is a a huge spike in difficulty when you get to hong kong, before I could get a score of 700 but after hong kong I can barely get to 300.

understand, off, bat, Great minimalist type game, simple enough to understand right off the bat. I appreciate the fact that there's no messing around with any lengthy unnecessary tutorials (the mechanics are simple enough to not warrant one, It's seriously not that difficult) the controls are a bit finicky, I find it hard to remove a track from a station, and everytime I do manage to do it I have no idea how I did it, but apart from that definitely worth the 99 cents.

listening, to, podcasts, There's nothing else like it. Chill and stylish, but deceptively puzzling. Perfect zen game to play while listening to podcasts.
spending, on, game, I dont think there is anything wrong with spending money on a game that you're dedicating time to, even if that game happens to be on your phone. People deserve to be paid for their labor! That said, this may be the best $1 I've ever spent, especially on a phone game. The mechanics are simple yet engaging, and the color schemes are just gorgeous. The full game is unlocked for your $1, plus there are NO ADS AT ALL. Give these people your money!
paid, for, labor, I dont think there is anything wrong with spending money on a game that you're dedicating time to, even if that game happens to be on your phone.

load, into, it, I cant rate this game if I cant load into it
seems, like, game, It seems like a fun game, but I seem to be running into a bug where I never get more than 3 lines. Every week it says I get a new line, but it doesn't show up.

play, on, metro, I really like this app. I play it on the metro and when Im bored. Please add the beautiful city of Amsterdam. It has a huge metro system and lots of water!! Then I would give 5 stars!
updated, for, gestures, The game is not updated for the persistent gestures of andriod 11, it's really frustrating to play right now. Otherwise it's a great game.
getting, into, it, Good fun! Just kinds getting into it but it looks like it'll be a great timesink. I only wish the mechanism to add carriages was a bit more natural, sometimes I'm not sure where I'm dropping things.
add, to, it, This is a perfect game. You wouldn't want to add anything to it, and you couldn't take anything away. It's just right. The graphics and interface are perfect for mobile devices. The gameplay is simple enough for anyone to understand, yet challenging and rewarding. Classic!
recommend, to, others, Truely challenging. I keep forgetting that I can pause the action. Definitely a game I will recommend to others.
stay, on, screen, Love this game so much! So simple to learn, and so addictive. The interface is so easy to learn! One improvement could be making the pause and speed buttons stay on screen permanently, or easier to click, as they're extremely important to hit accurately when things are getting busy.
transport, on, system, The Most Interesting Mobile Game I played in awhile the mechanics are deep and very hard to masters but it's addictive to play some maps of the famous cities and improve your metro system to take more and more people to transport them on your system. AMAZING.
focus, on, track, Train go brr but also break my heart :( Seriously tho this game confuses me, I wish I had a dashboard or something. Maybe a single out thing so I can focus on one track, this game is ruthless and unforgiving and dont think for a second that it'll give you a break, it's always something new to crush you and I love it.

pay, for, apps, I'm very hesitant to pay real money for apps on my phone because I get awful guilt after spending money. However, I bought this game the other day and have been playing it since. Clean, engaging, and absolutely addictive, I love playing the normal game mode, endless game mode, and creative game mode. Would absolutely recommend.
got, after, day, I got bored after a day
frustate, in, measure, Wow, what a fantastic game, simple to play but hard to master, I love games like this, it will please you and frustate you in equal measure I recommend it, but I would like to know what the option "Skip Transitions "means???
bought, in, platform, This is the only game I've ever bought in more than one platform, that's how much I like and recommend it. Got it for PC years ago on Steam, then recently got it again for Android, there's something poetic in playing it on your phone while riding one of the transit networks it emulates.

help, for, time, Very interesting game, it help my attention for quite some time given how simple it is.
play, for, minutes, Awsome simple game. Very fun and challenging but still simplistic and beautiful. Great game to play for a couple minutes here and there.
fit, in, station, How many cubes can fit in that triangle station before I lose
makes, for, killer, A simple yet challenging game that makes for a great time killer. It's easy to play and it can get you thinking on what to do in order to improve.
expected, for, game, Actually ended up having way more fun than I expected for a puzzle game I found on the app store. Love the minimalist look to it. A breath of fresh air compared to some of the other trash advertisement and mico transaction clusterf@%ks you might find on the play store. A solid recommend.

go, in, circles, Sometimes trains will not pickup passengers. I watched an empty train go in circles passing a full train stop again and again until I lost the game. Other than that, super fun game! It is a little bit hard to control / tap on the right object though.
waiting, for, something, Great for when you are waiting for something or just want to play something relaxing. Great Controls!
running, in, line, Game is good. But even though tram is running in the line, station getting overcrowded and the tram not picking anyone and game will get over. Am I missing something or is the game like that
feels, like, version, Good game concept and good reviews so I bought it. Unfortunately, it has a TON of bugs and it feels like a beta version of th game. To name a few: tutorial overlays work sometimes, time passes very inconsistently and new lines are given but not available for use.
play, on, way, Fun Relaxing Game to play on the the way to work...on a train.
grow, into, metropolis, Simple and addictive gameplay. Relaxing ambient sounds of your metro system will grow into a stressful metropolis that has overcrowded platforms. If that doesn't sound fun there is a creative mode where you can just make a neat map.
Looking, to, games, This game is surprisingly simple and I extremely addictive. It is my go-to for killing time in waiting rooms or long lines. You an pause and comeback to finish a board at anytime if needed. Looking forward to other games from this development team!
is, beneath, esthetism, Excellent and beneath the elegant well designed minimalist esthetism, there is a game that dares you to pick it up and not stay enthralled for hours, if not eternity.... Cheers!
play, on, metro, Awesome game, lots of fun. I have 1 request though, and it is the Bucharest metro system. I really want to play on the Bucharest metro, like other people, I think it would be a really nice addition to the already exceptional game.

care, about, game, Terrible game because the devs thinks they're oh so clever and cool by not including any sort of tutorial. I don't care enough about your mobile game to Google it and I'm not gonna spend the 5 or 10 minutes that I have to kill trying to figure it out, just gonna play something else. Bad game is bad.

have, With, interface, The game is simply addicting. With such simple interface and gameplay, you have to think the best way possible to line up the railway. You also want to think about line efficiency, somehow as the level progress, the stations will be crowded and you have to move the passengers otherwise the game will over. It's a fun game, but challenging as well.

Challenging, at, times, Really fun! Challenging at times but fun
Played, for, hours, This is just amazing ! Played for hours , obviously there can be loads to add or do to it but I dont thing it needs improvement or new features !!!! Its just perfect the way it is. I love it Thank you

played, for, years, I love this game. I've played it for years on my Macbook Pro, and was very excited to find the Android app. It's every bit as enjoyable on my phone as on my computer. Well done, Dinosaur Polo Club!
followed, since, beta, Have followed these guys since their online mini metro beta and I love how they built the game from the ground up, taking in suggestions from players and fans. The music is a lovely addition and fits perfectly with the minimal design. Thanks so much, devs!

stop, at, one, It is a fun game but somtimes when the trains are not even full or have any one on will stop stations and pick people up. One time i had just stated and the line had 3 stations and the train would not stop at one.
seen, in, game, The best ui I've seen in any game...
pass, by, passengers, This game is worth the price. The graphics and "controls" are great, and the gameplay is challenging but fun. I like the puzzle like aspect. It doesn't have a very detailed tutorial. I know it is the style of the game to be simple but I am slightly confused as to why my trains sometimes pass by passengers without picking them up, even if it is empty. I recommend this game.
Stopped, because, that, The game is interesting but UI and controls are horrible and frustrating. Stopped playing because of that.
spent, in, it, I absolutely adore this game. I admit, I have spent countless hours in it by sideloading an APK, but I am happy to have finally bought it! Awesome minimalistic game. Highly recommended. :D
eats, through, battery, Great game but it absolutely eats through my battery. I love it but you all have to fix this issue or just make it better.
included, in, map, Wish to see my city Kolkata. Although Mumbai is included in the map. Just so that the developers know India's first metro was introduced in Kolkata. Now it is being extended through tunnels under Ganga. It will be an interesting map to play I believe. Would love to see my city!

held, at, mercy, Great game, 4 stars because there are times when winning isn't possible, usually due to not having enough tunnels to make it possible. Also, for one bridge only challenges why are we held at mercy to the random station placing algorithm? It should always be possible to win and complete challenges in my opinion.

release, on, Android, Mini Metro is a great game. When will you release Mini Motorways on Android?
do, with, text, A game that doesn't tell you how to play or what to do next with text. You must discover by yourself how to play better everytime. The evolution of the "pac-man" game style. Even though you have already unlock the next stage/city. You want to beat your last best score in each city because of the little(but relevant) differences in gameplay.

play, in, mode, Very relaxing and really enjoy playing it. Only downside is that it's a bit too easy to unlock other cities. I get that this isnt a "challeng-y unlock them all" kind of game, you can chill out and play in endless mode all day and be so relaxed you melt into wherever you're sitting. The music(?) Is calming and the little bloops the trains make is delightful. I just wish I didnt unlock them all so quickly so I could enjoy discovering them all over again
played, in, time, Simple, meditative, and challenging. First mobile game I've played all the way through in a long time. Appreciate everything about this game!
add, as, map, Please add Budapest as a map
has, into, it, This game has something into it, love the graphics and the simplistic view of the metro. It ade me think more and it is a hell of a brain workout ngl.
working, with, trains, Everyone working with trains in german should play this game, maybe I wouldn't be late at least 2 hours twice every day
leads, to, gameplay, This is a genuinely brilliant wee game. Perfect balance of simple design which leads to complex gameplay. And zero adds. Plz buy. Give them all your money
challenges, in, situations, Very brainy game and challenges your brain in the critical situations , makes your very creative . Loved it value for money

scored, on, challenge, Enjoyable, challenging, a bit addictive (trying to resist!), no annoying adverts. ... but the high scores don't always work. Today I scored 1534 on the daily challenge but I'm only listed as 901.

struggling, with, controls, I am struggling with the controls. I enjoyed the speed of the tutorial, but I am still having trouble with deleting rails/metro lines. I love the endless and creative modes, a slower pace to playing the game all included in the app price

recommended, to, friends, I want to kiss the developer,this is the best game I have ever brought on playstore I have recommended this game to my friends too
gets, after, while, Lots of fun, but gets kinda repetitive after a while.
had, for, days, This game is great, I've only had it for 2 days and I've managed to get to level 5 or 6, it's difficult but not impossible. To say it's only £1.40 to £1.60 it's very good
Felt, like, curve, Beautifully presented and so simple to look at. Really addictive gameplay. Felt like the learning curve was too steep to start with, I was a little overwhelmed.
turn, into, game, nice minigame that can turn into a one hour game
looking, for, relaxation, chill, simple cute game to play when you are bored or are looking for relaxation, but it does offer a challenge!
passes, with, game, Time passes with this game so fluidly. Excellent
play, for, hours, Very fun time waster, could play for hours
gets, in, way, Loads of fun! Simple and slow start that has you feeling like you've got a handle on things then it quickly gets out of control in the best way possible! Easy buy.
