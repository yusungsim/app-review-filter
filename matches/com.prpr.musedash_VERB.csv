have, behind, paywall, Would be an easy 5 star game if they didn't have every good song behind a paywall üôÉ which I wouldn't mind if the game itself was free, but it isn't, so. I wish I was just being stingy but being from SA makes just one pack cost a luxury. I had fun back when they made entire packs free weekly for covid though

interact, with, characters, Beat rhythm game I've ever played, but I do hope players have the ability to create beatmaps and battle with players, make friends etc, or interact with the characters
buy, on, sale, Not a really perfect game since you need to pay more for unlocking popular music. Worth to buy DLC on 75% sale, on normal price? Not worth for sure
Uninstalled, due, problems, This is an amazing game. Amazing graphics, music, characters, etc. But theres something I have a problem with. When I Uninstalled the app due to problems with launching the app, it reset me back to level 69 (I was level 101 btw). I lost several characters, several songs, several elfins, and several characters chips and illustrations. Mind you, i was uninformed that itd reset some of my progress. Vv disappointed. Other than that, I'd say it's a pretty good game! I'd 100% recommend to my friends!
changed, in, game, I have already reversed left and right in the setting, but it hasn't changed in the game.Is it a bug Ôºü
spinning, For, real, For real the world is spinning right now after i play this game.
combined, with, art, Not generally a big fan of rhythm games, but this game hits a very good balance of simplicity and challenge, combined with lovely art, that makes me understand the appeal New to rhythm games or otherwise uninterested? Muse Dash might be your entry point
buy, until, gameplay, Just bought it today, i was planning to buy all the songs until just a few gameplay then returning to main menu causes the game to stuck at the loading screen. Whats worse is that everytime the game stucked i have to manually restart the hame.

Planned, from, version, One of the best rhythm games on mobile, my only problem being that you can't sync Just as Planned from the Steam version. It's a nice way to play the game on the go but I just wish that my purchase carried over.

put, on, level, I have this game on here and on steam and before it would let me sync my progress between the two however the last time I tried to play it on here I synced it as usual and it just put me back on level 1 even though both saves were higher level and I can't sync my progress again I'm still the same level on steam which is logged into the same account but level 1 on here now and there's no way to get my progress back.

takes, on, phone, My only complaint of this game is how much memory it takes up on my phone. But it's still very fun and I give it a 5/5.
crashes, on, note, I want to like this game but it crashes on the first note for a lot of songs and when I tried reinstalling to fix this (didn't work) it deleted all my progress

start, from, beginning, Chaged to one star after deleting my cloud save progress and forcing me to start from the beginning. Don't know how you'll restore everyone's lost data since it has been already overwritten. Hours of playtime wasted.
m, in, love, Im in love w this game
asked, for, refund, The game itself is amazing and one thing that I really liked is when I accidently bought the game and then asked for a refund I got refunded within 12hrs which is really good ..

sync, with, steam, Very fun tap rhythm game! I love the cute characters and each song seems to have such a impactful rhythm when you play! Only issue is that I can't sync my account with my steam one at the moment but other than that it's a great game!

have, With, headphone, great art, amazing. it's a bit over sexual but it's worth it! After nearly a year of playing I'm still in love with the game. With my Bluetooth headphone I have to have the hit sound shut off and sometimes it doesn't hit but I enjoy this game for fun, not to complain ^^ also if you're reading this join the discord <333 it won't dissapoint
log, with, acc, i cant log in with my facebook acc.. please fix this
logged, to, account, Game forced me to delete my cloud save. I logged in to my account, and it asked which save I wanted to pick.. no matter what option I picked (cloud save or local save) it kept saying it would select the brand new level 1 account. I force closed the app and it deleted my cloud save. After clearing data and trying to login again, my cloud save is replaced with the level 1 save... Disappointing, it was a fun game up until now.

start, from, level, Why i cant load my save ? And now my progress is gone , I was level 126 now you want me to start from level 1 again ..... Okay good job
play, on, mobile, The game is extremely fun if you like Rhythm games. I have 2 complaints though, sometimes when I go to play a song the game crashes or on certain song it will have a annoying static noise. I play on mobile so some of these problems may not occur on other devices. Other than that this is a great game.

played, with, thumbs, Friendly for people new to rhythm games. Can be played with only 2 thumbs as it only has "up" and "down" which is excellent for mobile as it can be played to kill time in commutes or what not (if you are not ashamed of being seen playing an "anime" game that is) When you play the high level stages you'll have to use 4 fingers. Has a large free songs library and has a good offer on all purchasable dlc.

play, on, mobile, The game is nice, many songs to choose from, and is F2P friendly. I would give it 5 stars, however it seems that if you would like to play on mobile AND PC, then you will run into problems. Save progress does not sync between PC and mobile. Also, if you have bought a DLC on mobile like me, then you must also pay for it on PC, as there is no way to transfer purchases. Apart from this quite annoying issue, the game totally deserves 5 stars!

work, for, me, Just bought this game today, enjoying the gameplay and graphics so far but I am having some trouble with the offset adjustment. None of the values seems to work for me and I have been getting greats more than perfects lol. I didn't experience this issue in other mobile rhythm games I play so it is weird (maybe just a lagging issue??) Edit: okay, so I ended up setting my offset value to 0.211 lmao, it works fine now

battle, with, players, This is the best rhythm game I have ever played! Good graphics, good music, everything is good. I wish the girls have more dialogues and voices, that would make the game more lively. I also recommend making a " make-your-own-song " feature so that people can make their own song and beatmaps. I also wish that this game have multiplayers and online battles so that we can battle with other players and friends. Very good game, 5 stars. Definitely would recommended to my friends... if I had one :'(

having, in, update, Love this game!!! The songs are great and the levels are quite challenging like osu. Also, in the new update I've been recently having a problem with sailor suit buro not hitting the notes that are marked. When I hold a note that is marked, it won't hit the long note after that. This never happened before. So I was confused.

buy, on, mobile, Only complaint is the season pass doesnt share platforms. Its fully worth it especially with the touhou collab but im sad i would have to buy it again on mobile. Great rythm game
have, in, game, I really like the music and have tens of hours in the game on Steam. But hey, devs, be honest with me. Is it really that hard to set up a way to track DLC purchases between platforms? Since I'm using the same account on both devices, and it saves my scores and favourite songs, it seems like a kind of ridiculous notion that it wouldn't be possible to set a flag in the account that tracks unlocks and purchases as well. I'm not suggesting it's easy, but surely it's at the very least possible?

I'm not suggesting it's easy, but surely it's at the very least possible?
set, in, account, I really like the music and have tens of hours in the game on Steam. But hey, devs, be honest with me. Is it really that hard to set up a way to track DLC purchases between platforms?

stays, on, screen, As others have said, the game won't load and just stays on a black screen.
playing, with, ü§§, I very enjoyed playing with marija ü§§
cause, on, devices, Its easy to pick up, and hard to master, love it. I'd suggest turning off sound effects because it can cause audio desync on lower end devices like mine. I love that each week you get a free song to play from the ones you'd usually have to pay for.

turning, at, Settings, This game is so great that the only problem I have is having a hard time to stop. Also, there seems to be many complaints about only having BLACK SCREEN when opening the app, turning on the Fullsreen mode at Advanced Settings for the app fixed it for me. Hope that helps, developers should probably do something about it.

load, for, reason, The game is great, but for some reason when I try to open it, it won't load, just a black screen, I rebooted my device, deleted app data, but still won't launch, how is this possible in a paid game?
buy, for, reason, A good game but I have troubles with the game crashing and having problems with the game freezing. Edit: I have to buy the game again for some odd reason.
play, with, fingers, I've been playing this game and have been seeing it since it came out and love how simple and yet how hard some of the songs are. The fact that you can play with only two fingers is one of the best parts I think at least. Love the songs and the design of the game in general.
show, on, mobile, I have just as planned dlc on pc version but it doesn't show up on mobile even though I've synced my account. Help, please
keep, on, beat, Ok click game for the price and no ads. Most songs dont keep on the beat with enemies which is a bit annoying but overall OK experience.

log, into, game, this game is such a great rhythm game but lately I can't log into the game.. the screen is all black
Have, on, mobile, Have this game both on mobile and steam, definitely a great rhythm game to play
buying, of, packs, Very beautiful game. Great design and great music. Recommend buying the bundle instead of individual packs.
chilling, at, work, Been loving this game, it's a nice game to chill out to while chilling at work, or waiting for stuff to load.

recommend, to, those, This game is wonderful!! I recommend it to those wanting to try out rhythm games, this one is really addicting, and worth the money. Leveling up can get you characters, little friends that help you, or cool illustrations you can view while the song loads! It's a beautiful experience, there are songs and characters you can purchase, I personally think it's worth it, most importantly, the songs, they're really good and challenging on the difficulties! I totally recommend!

bought, at, steam, I love this game, I bought it at steam first and I have been in love since it.
register, from, time, it's a good game, i really like it. however, the game tends to like to not register my taps from time to time. i even had times where i couldn't move at all and just had to take damage because i couldn't do anything, i couldn't even pause. it's still a great game don't get me wrong, but i might switch over to the pc version. also I don't know why but it fails every so often with synchronisation to my pc, which is a right kick in the balls when you have allot of progress on phone but not on pc.

log, to, account, Why cant i log in to my account?
streaming, for, crime, Chinese censorship ruined this game. Vtubers worldwide were banned from streaming it for the horrible crime of accidentally(!) Acknowledging Taiwan's independence. Seems a little sensitive, no?
play, with, normaly, I wish we could play with sleepwalker girl normaly but we cant good game tho

fun, after, years, game still fun after years of playing then stoped playing, then picking it up again. its one of its kind among other rythm game. reminiscing patapon game, which one of old psp game that i liked. and still playing lol.
planned, on, platforms, Â•ΩÁé©ÔºåÈõôÂπ≥Âè∞ÁöÜÊúâË≥ºÂÖ•Ë®àÂäÉÈÄöÔºå‰ΩÜpcËàáÊâãÊ©üË≥áÊñô‰∫íÈÄöÊúâÂïèÈ°åÔºåË¶Å‰∫∫ÊâãÈáçÊñ∞ÁôªÂÖ•„ÄÇÂ∏åÊúõÊúÉ‰øÆÂæ©„ÄÇ Great game, purchased 'just as planned' on both platforms, but it has problems when cross saving between pc and mobile, manual re-login is required. Hope to see it patched.
buy, in, version, A really amazing rythm game, I would even go as far as to say the best on Mobile, but then why a 3 star rating? Well that because I own the dlc on the steam version and similarly I paid here to buy the game too but now the game wants me to buy the dlc in the mobile version too, to play the dlc, that's just absurd, why do i have to pay for the same thing twice when I already own it and paid the game to buy here too, I really hope the Devs sort this out because without that I can't recommend this.

pander, to, p*dos, The only rhythm game to pander to p*dos, wish I didn't buy this.
obtained, in, version, Good game on PC especially, but unfortunately the mobile game version refuses to acknowledge the new data I've obtained in the PC version, and simply continues to pull the old data from the cloud despite both versions using the same Google account (no, I do not own the DLC on either version).

choose, from, difficulty, Great cute game with fantastic characters, a lot of songs to choose from though higher difficulty seems impossible on a mobile phone.

profit, from, game, Fantastic gameplay, control, wonderful music, and its offline (i play when i dont have interent to kill time) but the very good and popular songs are paid ( i personally understand that they need to profit from the game, and i have bought some packs) nonetheless great game. (Shinsou Masui, try it)
downloaded, for, phigros, it's a very pretty game with a cute artstyle and pretty characters! I downloaded this for the phigros Collab (I am a big fan of phigros lol and this game has a good reputation) and I liked this game a lot so I decided to buy some more packs. sailor suit buro's ability sometimes makes the game lag though for some reason... it can be fixed by lowering the quality but it isn't as pretty. and sometimes loading can take a while.... still a nice game though

said, to, Google, When it said login to Google it reset all of my progress i had good characters and it just reseted my progress i hate it
Played, on, songs, Very cute and colorful, great animation/music, BUT big flaw is the best makers are consistently out of beat with the songs! Played around on diff songs and it was noticably off beat on each, making it highly difficult to play properly, sadly.

hit, in, middle, The controls are simple and all the artwork is beautiful. You'll unlock everything quickly. idk if it's my phone or the game, but it is easy to accidently hit the home button in the middle of a stage, even with navigation lock on. My biggest complaint is I have to hit the pause button multiple times for it to register. All these waifus but I want at least one husbando XD

display, on, duo, I love the game however I wish it could display properly on the Surface duo, vertically it expands fine but horizontally there's about half an inch missing on both sides of the screen, and that hinders the experience a bit. If only there was a way to adjust the ratio...

buy, from, Steam, Before I played this game I was worrying and thought "This maybe not worth the money" but I bought it anyway and I was wrong, the graphics, the songs, everything is so good! I can't stop playing it. I even buy it from Steam for my PC! It's just so good!

run, on, device, Will not run on my device.
log, in, account, This game is fun and you can play it anywhere. It's just that sometimes my taps aren't getting sensed by the game so I often miss... Is there a way to fix this? Also I CANNOT log in my Google account.. I can on my tablet but not on my phone..
put, like, bcus, This game is amazing! I like the graphics so much! But it will be more fun if we can put our own song to play. I just want to put a song like opening anime bcus the song kind of rock and beat. It gonna be fast but its very fun! I hope the developer read this! Thank you so much for making this game and makes us happy! (‚óç‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢‚óç)‚ù§

think, From, characters, I've always been a big rhythm game player I play games like beatsaver and tap tap revolution and I enjoyed musse Dash very much. From the Q characters and the bright colors and the wonderful soundtrack I think it's all top-notch
hoping, for, something, The game is good but was a little buggy was also hoping for something different... Have the game on steam btw.
purchases, in, pc, Would be 5* if I can use my character and play other song that I allready purchases in pcüò≠

works, for, time, The game itself is great with the amount of content available for people who didn't buy any of the DLCs. However, the game only works for the first time you run it, whenever I try to run in a 2nd time, it gets stuck at a black screen. I've tried reinstalling the game twice now, the problem still happens.

gets, after, bit, This game is really good, its not toi sexualized to hurt my baby virgin eyes but its still really pretty and the songs are great :) it gets boring after a bit tho
coming, for, free, A very good rhythm game especially the art on this one which is totally cute. On the other parts like the DLC which is a fantastic idea paying Just as Planned will make you unlock all songs and later dlc coming for free which is fantastic........ (Truly a masterpiece)
eyeing, for, while, Sorry to leave a review like this. I have been eyeing this game for a while now and decided to give it a shot, but when I opened the game all I got was a black screen? I'm not able to play something that I paid for :/
keeping, on, playing, Game's fun and all but there's a point where there's not much to do, keeping on playing doesn't seem rewarding since the only thing to unlock are wallpapers, and the fact you have to pay to unlock characters in an already paid game is really frustrating.

get, into, games, This game is amazing there is only one thing that I wish I could add and that's to add songs and chart them are selfs like something kinda like GD but other than my crazy idea this game is amazing and challenging it's a great rhythm game for people who have never played a rhythm game to easily get into rhythm games and I love all the songs and it sold me when I saw that mope mope was a level so congrats because I'm keeping this game for a long time

fell, in, love, Was hesitant at the beginning but fell in love with it, the animations are smooth the gameplay is fast.i am more use to the notes coming top towards the bottom so i just turn it sideways and it's amazing. would definitely recommend!

starting, at, beginning, Love the graphics and characters, starting out the game at the beginning and it seems really good to be honest, keep up the great work!
buy, for, music, Overall a good rhythm game but you need a money to buy a dlc music pack for better music
works, on, mobile, Game works great on mobile. Crashes instantly on my Chromebook. Otherwise, a fantastic mobile rhythm game.
had, on, it, Muse Dash is an amazing rhythm game. Albeit it's not my type, I definitely had lots of fun on it! I might have a nitpick on framerate but, nothing too shabby. I have bought the Cytus DLC, but, I found out it was a little too difficult for my skill. Regardless, even if I played it a few times, I still enjoyed the game. There's PLENTY of songs to play with weekly free rotations to see which suits your music taste. It's accessible, simple, challenging, yet enjoyable! It's worth your money.

stop, at, %, I cant download it, alway stop at 5%
irl, because, issues, Ive bought the pc version for Muse Dash, and now because of certain issues irl im only able to be on my phone, so i thought "Why not get Muse Dash again?." I bought the game and all i was greeted was a black screen. Nice one guys, yall got yourselves a quick refund smh
paying, for, songs, June /7/ 2021 I really enjoyed this game it has very upbeat songs. u are paying $3 for 61 songs as of this review which already is well worth your money. On top of that you can pay $30 for the season pass of this game which is another 220+ songs. I added the plus because this game release 6 more songs every month for you to enjoy if you have the dlc. If you end up liking the game the dlc Is really great value for money spent. the season pass also goes on sale regularly I got mine for $23 usd.

played, since, work, An absolute amazing rhythm game One if not the best I played since Cytus 2 great work
did, with, design, This game is really good. I love what you guys did with the character design and the songs are really good. The controls don't seem to bother me and I love that. Keep up the great work!
fit, with, beat, Super dope... But something tells me that some rhythm doesn't fit correctly with the beat but overall very good music and gameplay experience
get, on, sell, Not a full game when install initially. DLC is pretty much 70% of the game get it on sell so you won't feel like you miss out on the game.

played, for, months, Worth the purchase even though it's a dollar, love this game when I started playing. The music is great! Solid *5 (edit) I've played this game for quite the months and it's great! I bought all the dlc's and it was worth it. I got good at the game and it's quite easy to learn. One of the best mobile rhythm games out thereüëç

I bought all the dlc's and it was worth it. I got good at the game and it's quite easy to learn. One of the best mobile rhythm games out thereüëç
transfered, between, platforms, Very fun, wish the song packs transfered between platforms though.
crash, upon, opening, Couldn't play the game as it would crash upon opening. Will update once I can play.
stare, at, myself, It was good until the update hit, now i just stare at myself from the reflection of the black screen which fyi is not a very pleasing image to look at so please fix this quickly

slows, on, lg, Good but on a lg it kinda slows it down so I'm putting it on my tablet

Played, for, bit, Played this for a bit, and it's very good. 5/5
try, on, pc, Like the game but it's basically just unbeatable [white label] but worse and not free try that game on pc first if given the opportunity
work, on, phone, App not installing. It used to work on my other phone but now, when you open it, there is only a black screen. I've checked the obb folder and there is nothing in it. Other than that, it's a very good game. You'll definitely get your money's worth.
play, for, fun, Very fun for something to pass time or just play for fun :„Äã
Bought, on, phone, Bought this on my other phone using my account, so why in my other phone cant install this?

Played, for, while, Cool game. Played it for a while, I'd definitely recommend it to people who are new to rythym games

compared, to, Japanese, Wronly assumed to buyung a full game but it's understandable since the price was low. I was also under the impression that all the songs are Japanese weeb songs but no, there are Chinese ones, and Mandarin really sounds rough (compared to Japanese) because it's a tonal language. The music is still many times great compared to the wipespread tiktok garbage mumble rap "songs" tho

got, because, lag, When i got the game to stop crashing all the time i couldn't even play like i want because of the lag and the could not calibrate to the right offset because the way that you calibrate is trash and when you get it right its wrong anyway because off the lag

own, on, PC, Very good game I own this on PC and play it often. unfortunately, it's unplayable on mobile with Bluetooth earbuds. The delay caused the feedback sound to be delayed excessively (>300ms). Which will mess you up. It can be turned off but the satisfying tap tap sounds is half the fun.
buy, on, Steam, I really love Muse Dash, enough to buy it on Steam. So, I even bought Just As Planned there on Steam and now, with a new phone, I got mobile version again. Im pretty disappointed that I have to buy Just As Planned AGAIN for mobile, despite my account being linked to the Steam version. I payed that ammount, why must I pay it again? And it wasn't a small amout for my case.

play, from, version, This game is really really great to play but when i play my data from pc version to my phone, i couldn't play all DLC's even though i bought them, I don't want to spend my money anymore once i bought it on steam. If you can, please, i want to play it on my phone . . .

play, with, :), the gameplay is good, enjoyable and absolutely relaxing. Plus, there's many girls too play with :). Overall, this game is worth paying. EDIT: Hello X.D.Network. for some reason my account's data was kinda off. I have already bought the ‚ÄúMuse radio" and ‚Äúcollab" packs. but when i logged in just now, those packs was loss. And some character that i have already owned was also reset collecting fragment. Can you please check this problem? thank you. IGN:Maxfact

pervy, with, ton, It's a pretty good rhythm game. Fun, kinda pervy character designs with a ton of charm. My main problem is that the game is just a little lacking in depth. I'm playing songs at Level 6 now and it's starting to feel a bit repetitive. Great for killing time here and there, though.

ran, into, bugs, Alright. This is definitely one of the greatest mobile rhythm games in history. Really fun game, and so far, i havent ran into ANY bugs or glitches yet.
play, without, wifi, Thanks for the game I really love it.is very fun to play without wifi I like it very much I hope the game have a new update song
have, on, Steam, I love this game I have it on my Steam so I can play on the PC and on my mobile device. But when I start the app I just get a black screen. I pay 3‚Ç¨ just to open the app and be disappointed? Damn... Please fix this I have a Oneplus 8 Pro running on Android 11. Already tried searching for solutions on google and reddit, there are many having the same problem but there's no fix for it.

sets, for, generation, A music rhythm game with simple yet fun gameplay. Cute graphics and immersive soundtracks. Muse Dash sets a new baseline for the new generation of rhythm games. Thank you for crafting this splendid piece of art.
work, on, A70, Does not work on Samsung Galaxy A70, black screen after giving storage permissions.
paid, for, this, I don't even remember how much I paid for this but this is GREAT! I'll test it a bit more before giving 5 stars but so far it seems a pretty fun and catchy game
have, on, laptop, Addicting gameplay, outstanding graphics, and a well running engine. This is the perfect tap to the beat game. I have it on my laptop as well and i am obsessed. Highly recomend. Most songs are Japanese and weird but there are also song with just a beat and even some with english lyrics. You will not regret trying this game.
love, about, game, i absolutely love everything about this game from the art style to the gameplay. hands down the best rhythm game i have ever played

locked, to, music, Pretty good game, but too bad certain areas are locked to a payed music set
have, on, switch, One of my favourite gamesters 100%. This is my 3rd purchase, I have it on switch & pc. Simple yet hard, beautiful and sweet. A little bit of skin but not too much to be inappropriate for under-age! Totally a time vortex, watch out! :)
Fix, off, data, It's a good game but the hits are way to early. Fix this or your off the data of my phone (!__!)
play, for, reason, Was able to play it once and for some reason I can't play it again. Other than that, I'd love to give it 5 stars
straining, on, fingers, Had you asked me if I liked rythmn games a month ago, I would've said no. But Muse Dash hits that sweet spot of easy to pick up and still having a very high skill ceiling. I only really have two complaints: It's a bit straining on your fingers on mobile, and there's definitely problematic characters from a design standpoint. Other than that it's great

making, at, time, They have no business making something so cute and so fire at the same time
getting, for, long, I love this game! I debated on getting it for so long because of the purchase but hey 1.99 isn't THAT bad. Only two things that I have an issue with, is that when I try to open the app up it sometimes crashes and takes me a minute or two to reopen it without it crashing. The other thing is that sometimes it is delayed, I even messed with the settings to see if I had it wrong but it's just a thing that sometimes happens. OVERALL I love it 100%, music, characters, and the rhythm base gaming.

ly, at, types, This game is awesome, graphics are very impressive, overall very good game, its a rhythm based game and im most certai ly good at those types so this game is is perfect, although some characters are pay-to-win.
played, in, life, best game i have ever played in my life. marija is best girl
switched, to, something, Great game, but I switched my devise to something better than when I bought it and now when I open it the game just black screens
have, in, switch, I like this game. I actually have it in nintendo switch first. So when it came to mobile, I was excited. But I noticed something odd about the game in my mobile (Huawei P30). At first I thought it's just one song but it's several songs - the beats and song DON'T sync. It's a few milliseconds too fast. I tried running the offset but it's still the same. Please rectify the port at least.

buy, in, it, This game is awesome! It was worth paying this game. The design and graphics are so good! Love the songs, especially Haloweak's maybe not now, but I'll buy all the songs in it too!
Planned, on, pc, So I bought Just as Planned on pc , apparently doesnt sync with mobile and have to buy again for 100++ ? Nope :3 . Ini semua pundeii . :3

put, at, +, Overall a pretty fun game, art and graphics are extremely on point. But the lack of storyline(s) and some hypersexualised characters kinda drive me off, so here's a tip, put the age minimum at 15+, as 12 year olds might get a wrong concept about this game, other than that it's pretty good game at around a 7.5/10.
play, with, rhythm, I enjoyed the constant play. This game has given us a new idea to play with rhythm. I advise everyone to try it.
have, on, steam, I have it on steam
suck, at, it, Ah yes, a rhythm game but with cute girls. The ecchi theme and everything, it's splendidly perfect. The graphics, and everything about this game is just wonderful. Even though I couldn't get perfect scores cause' I suck at it, it's still great.
play, on, go, Being able to play on the go is amazing and i have always loved this game
play, for, while, I havent play Muse Dash for a while and I use a facebook account to save my progress but facebook wont work can you help? I'm currently using a local save progress but my facebook progress have more level and more character
getting, at, it, It's a very lovely game, I've been enjoying it and getting better and better at it
like, about, this, It's not an easy game but that's what I like about this. Didn't regret every peso to buy this game. Hope you still continue to update. More power!

heard, about, it, I saw this game a few times and said that seems interesting. Until my brother asked if I had heard about it and I said yes he said you should play it and of course I did and I was hooked the art style is really cute and the songs are great and I love this game!

open, on, note, i cant open it on my redmi note 8 pro, its only black screen, please help me,
Stuttering, after, days, Stuttering everywhere after 2 days. Great
getting, on, sale, Purchased this plus the DLC after getting it on sale on the Switch. Kinda upset I bought the game twice. At the sane time this is the kind of game you might buy twice just so you can play it more often. Wish I could link my progress here with my Switch but that just means I gotta 100 it twice... Which normally would suck but this is a fun game so I don't mind.

know, in, game, very fun and simple to play, just wish there are more popular songs that i know in the game
spend, on, it, I love this game no bug's just about no laggy inerface apart from some very sexual themes but I don't care about that the game is worth all the money you spend on it.
enjoyed, on, switch, I've thoroughly enjoyed this game on switch for a while and got the mobile game as well because I enjoy the game so much.

leading, to, notes, Game is fun and the songs are good, but my main problem is that the game is laggy at times, leading to multiple missed notes, ruining your combo. Once this is fixed this would definitely be a 5 star game.
saw, from, play, To be honest I saw gura from hololive play it and it ignited a passion for rythem games thank you for making this good game
spend, on, game, Really worth the money that I spend on this one game, the music are top-notch too (y)
paid, for, anymore, Black screen when opening. Not sure if it's temporary but I can't play what I paid for anymore :(
give, at, 4, I give at 4 because i had purchase all the song and it cost 29.99üò°
got, on, Steam, I love this game. I initially got it on Steam a long while back and loved it since. As someone who constantly needs to be doing something with their hands and desires visual stimulation; the game is challenging, addictive, and the graphics/designs are beautiful. The music selection is outstanding and varied. The devs are wonderful and humorous, and it doesn't go unnoticed.

marketed, to, audience, If you have a Miniso chain of stores in your country, you will realise that the business model is very similar. It is a Chinese app pretending to be a Japanese one marketed to a English speaking target audience. The product is very much like those in Miniso, competively priced, some misses but more hits. At less than $3, it is worth picking up. Hopefully, the developers will add more content in time to come. Edit: After having this game for about 3 years, what I can say is, buy this game!

tried, Like, goofball, Like a goofball, I tried playing this with a wireless headset that has a 700ms latency. Of course the game doesn't support a delay that bonkers, but that's an extreme case anyway. Great game.

control, over, character, Best anime-themed rhythm game, even better it can be played offline so i can still play it when im out of internet! Gameplay is pretty much similar to taiko overall, but more innovative, you control over a character that will run and beat enemies following the rhythm. There is in-app purchases, but the default one have plenty lot of musics and free characters. Very worth the price, especially if you love rhythm game, anime-themed game, and looking for a good game playable offline.

eyeing, on, game, I've been eyeing on this game for a long time! I'm not playing it much, but I'm really amazed by the visuals (I didn't expect this years April fools illustration would be my favorite!) My only problems were the double tap needed to pause midgame and the difficulty to rotate the screen. Other than that, this is amazing. A must try, worth the money!

completed, In, opinion, Game Is Good In my opinion, But as of now ive completed every free (Default) Songs, and with this you are resorted too spending real money in order to have some sort of fun (Mostly All rhythm Games) Sure you Can Go back and do Hard/Master (difficulty) But That is all there is too this game (The Songs) The Game is Small From what Ive Seen from other Rhythm Games, Alot of things could be expanded on, Such as the topic for this Review (Default/Free Songs) its lacking and I want to see more of it!

stay, with, version, the notes was very desynced from the songs on my phone, I think I will stay with the Switch version instead
found, through, collab, I found this Game through the collab with Cytus 2. And i absolutely love it. It's so different yet so similar, it makes you really work on improving your hand eye coordination. I absolutely love the character design, although its a bit...q u e s t i o n a b l e at times. I think this is the best dollar ive spent.

fell, for, joke, I got fooled by their April Fools joke. Those damn devs really know how to strike me down. This was the first time I ever fell for an April Fools joke. I now hate the devs and myself.
play, since, Game, It was very fun to play since its a Rhythm Game.
used, to, game, Amazing game. Might take a while to get used to a side scrolling rhythm game but its hella fun and soothing. Character designs are amazing too. Theyre cute. Music choice is outstanding, a mix of happy upbeat ones with other genres
seems, in, that, This is a great rhythm game imo. Though I'd like to report a bug with the sorting system, that seems to have changed in the few months since I last played this, in that if I have it set to only show the default music, some songs from other music packs get filtered in anyways.

maximize, due, problem, Having problem with controls, sometimes unresponsive. Cant even maximize my combo due to the problem. Its kinda frustrating
have, on, switch, Solid game. Music is good, regular updates, and I have it on switch. Sadly, no linking profiles.

make, in, beats, This game is so much fun to play, the only downside is that it crashes a few times before loading up. But all in all the beats and characters make up for the price

addicted, to, game, I've already addicted to this gameüíó
sold, on, discount, One hell of a fun time, easy to pick up gameplay, really, really hot waifus, and well worth its price. As of 3/31/21, for April Fools, a lot of the song library is being sold on a discount, so I say it'd be well worth it to buy stuff now!

filing, for, bankruptcy, Intuitive and good music. Sad that they filing for bankruptcy and discontinue further updates....
synce, with, music, A very fun rhythm game and one worth my money. Minor problems with this is how the beats don't always synce with the music. Anyways, overall a pretty fun and enjoyable game.
buying, for, dollar, Really good game, worth buying for only 1 dollar!!!!
install, on, tablet, The app would not install on my tablet. Support reached out finally. Although their suggestion was unhelpful, I was finally able to get everything working after reading online help forums.
gone, for, nothing, Game doesn't work. When I launch the game I only see a black screen. My money is gone for nothing!
work, on, Android, Does not work on Android
have, As, game, This is just fine game for me. Quite stressful enough, not enjoyable. Note design and timing of the notes are not quite related to the songs. As a "rhythm" game, notes have to be shown before I hit. But I found that several notes come out all of the sudden. You should remember all notes if it's possible. And offest option is quite strange. I cannot understand what it represents exactly. Well, but some of the contents like game designs and songs are pretty neat. So, your choice to play.
coming, for, more, Absolutely amazing game! The graphics and characters are very beautiful not to mention the songs are an absolute treat to listen too! The gameplay has me coming back for more each time and never lacks in keeping me motivated and entertained. I can honestly say this is the best rythme game I've ever played and is well worth the price.
waste, in, worth, Love it. At first i think that icwill just waste my money in not a worth it game but wow the graphics, the visual of the game this is what a rythym game i want!! Good job to the team who create this gameü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

differs, from, games, This game for sure wasn't a waste of money. One of the best rhythm games out there for sure. Really differs from other rythem games and that's what I like about it.

playing, for, minutes, When I start playing the game for at least 5-20 minutes a weird LOUD Ear Screeching Technical noise comes out of nowhere blasting my ears off, I was even have headphones on while playing enjoying the game/music, I wonder if its a bug or glitch causing my game go WONKY. I would appreciate that noise/problem fixed please... (It really does hurt my hearing & it scares me out of nowhere)
benefit, for, songs, Great game..... But crash rate is little high.... It takes my phone back to the homescreen at random times. Other than that nice game it has great characters that can benefit your score and great designs for the songs so kawaii. But please fix the crashing rate. üò´üôèüôèüíì
paid, for, game, I paid for the game only for it not to work on one device and say I didn't pay for it even though my google play balance went down.

made, for, fans, Sick game! Definitely made for anime fans and rhythm gamers. Very fun and addictive ngl. Characters are great too. Tracklist is a banger.
shows, for, second, Doesn't work, shows a purple screen for a second and then goes to black until it disappears completely
get, through, level, i love this game. i play it, i guess, everyday. the music is really good, and the game has really, really good graphics. the aesthetics are good, and you level up fast so you dont have to play 100 songs just to get through one level. its very good, and i dont think it needs any changes. good job!
bought, on, pc, Great rythm game, I have a really bad phone (Samsung GALAXY S5) and it still runs great. I have bought this game on pc and phone, beautiful graphics, great songs, and good controls. Also, if you like it make sure to get the DLC.
decided, On, day, This game is an ASTONISHING game, thats it. I only downloaded Muse Dash about a week ago. I was over my friends house and he taught me the basics of the game in PC, While I dont have a PC I do have a mobile device. On that same day I decided to purchase the app and been constantly playing this game ever since. Thank you PeroPeroGames for this marvellous, bewildering, and adoring game.
stop, at, point, Its a great game.... But the problem is when you uninstall this app and re install it again it will stop at some point and it will stop downloading
play, on, Chromebook, Unable to play on my Chromebook. I have a Samsung Chromebook running Intel i5 Processor (10th Generation). Most of the time, premium games purchased from Google Play Store will work. Was hoping games from the Play Store could be compatible with the processor. Could not give it a 1 star if I can't play it.

go, for, offbeat, So, I give it 4 stars for one big reason. I don't know what causes this to happen, perhaps it's because I only have wireless headphones, but the beats are just a tad bit off from the max I can go for the offbeat. I'd change this to 5 stars once it'd be fixed, otherwise a well developed game, addicting for some music lovers, and good songs all around.

track, with, objects, A good fun game but the sound doesn't track with the objects you have to hit.
transfer, from, pc, It sucks that you can't transfer data from pc but I love the game
ask, for, more, Cute girls and great music. Can't ask for more.
live, in, country, Great game. All of my friends who live in the country of Taiwan love it.
got, into, game, Banned hololive from streaming, they were the reason I got into the game in the first place. Should keep their political feelings out of the picture when it comes to their game.

listen, to, music, The game play & songs are very good. Like the art style also. Would be nice if have "Jukebox" mode where I can just listen to the music and do my work. Keep up the good work!
