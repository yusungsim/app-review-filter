build, for, fun, Worth the game its simply mechanics but its all about timing and how long you build your kingdom for its pretty fun it lags little bit sometimes but the visual are appealing to me with the sound effects. So 8/10👍

running, at, 20fps, Game is great but runs poorly. not sure if it's a design choice but it feels like it's running at around 20fps, and it just feels so strange. running in a note 20 ultra SD 865+

played, By, one, By far one of the best mobile games I've ever played. Very addictive but engaging. Not too pricey either, and you get a full product playable from start to finish, with plenty of hours' worth of content. However, it does suck your battery dry, and sometimes it felt like my phone was going to give me third degree burns. I'm sure this is just an optimisation issue. Otherwise, runs like a charm.

trying, out, game, I passed this game up a lot. But after trying it out the game quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. Absolutely amazing and worth the price. Hoping that online coop comes soon.
zoomed, after, update, Camera is way to zoomed out after latest update
come, during, day, Love the Norse Lands, just a few issues I've noticed: - Why no zoom? - Banker sometimes doesn't come out of the building during the day and therefore can't make a deposit. - Can't send knights to destroy the portholes. - When I did succeed in sending knights, archers don't automatically follow knights into battle. A lonely knight stood valiantly in front of the porthole until the night fell across the land... Just what I've found so far 😁

play, in, times, I love the game on PC and Switch and wanted to be able to play in times where I'm on a plane. I refunded however since my Razor Kishi is not supported even though it detects the right button press for coop?? I feel like controller support on mobile would tie up the bow on a already great game.

introduced, in, update, New zoom/aspect ratio introduced in the lastest update is too small, game becomes unplayable on a cellphone screen. Will update review if option to change zoom is added, since this game is amazing.
goes, to, tree, Great game, right up until you accidentally misclick a tree and destroy your entire run. And yes, there is a strategy, and being uncompromising is part of the game. Don't get me wrong, I adore this game. But losing hours of progress because your coin goes to a tree instead of the peasant you meant to? It's an old complaint, and I keep coming back, but it's an instaquit every single time it happens. Add in an undo option (even if just for trees and with no return) and the game would be perfect.

go, to, tab, STOP REVIEW BOMBING OVER ZOOM! Pause the game and go to the OPTIONS tab! The setting is right there! As for a real review- the game is addicting. It doesnt explain much of anything to you so you end up just having to go along and figure it out which is fun in its own way as well. Make money, upgrade, expand, die, and get farther progression next time from the previous king/queens upgrades. Good luck conquering, I can't put the game down.

adjust, in, menu, I love this game been playing for quite awhile but the latest update has messed up the zoom the screen is way to far out I'd say have it so you can adjust it in the menu as right now it can be hard for people who are near sighted. Also I have ran into a bug where on the two crowns map I simply cannot move forward anymore it just happens randomly and reloading does not fix it.

play, for, time, After playing it, here are some of my thoughts. better when you play for the first time players can choose kingdom/gender/character customization and then enter tutorial mode. then for coop/local multiplayer you should add an option via tethering or the same wifi so that every player who buy this game can focus on playing on their own phone, multiplayer options can be more than 2 which can be 3-10 at once, chat feature between players in local mode, minimap to mark enemies appear as dots/arrows

increase, since, update, Cant increase the zoom of the game since the last update. I am stuck in 1 X mode and everything is too small To see on my phone . It's a shame because I live the game and have purchased them all except the newest Norse one.

play, in, coop, I really like the game, and haven't experienced any lag or glitches others talk about. I do think that coop flipped screens hound be faced the other way, the position you have to be in to play in coop is very awkward.
REALLY, like, game, I REALLY like the game, but the new update doesn't let me fix my camera to zoom back in. It's really bugging me and I tried to delete it and re install it it didn't work. Otherwise it's a good game.
Love, to, game, A good game to play. Love the art and style to this game. Game play is good as well. Much better then the fist game a bit. Have not played the multiple part of the game yet though. Only problem is the frame rate get bad when there's lots going on. At some point you have so much people on screen and so much monster it drops a lot. But it's a ok game.

found, on, store, The only game that I've found on this store worth paying for. I LOVE IT!!
Own, in, switch, Own it in the switch, xbox, iPad, ps4 & my phone. I get that it's excessive but I play it so much and I want the studio to succeed. What a great franchise.
works, in, game, A beautiful game!!! There isn't too much help on how everything works in the game. There is also a bug with selecting the avatar.
intrigued, to, reviews, Just bought the game because i got intrigued to the reviews and gameplays of it. But after buying it, i couldn't play on it at all... All are black, Always being stucked on a floating king in a horse in the middle of black background. (Yes, i have a low spec phone since i thought that it's mobile and compatible to my device, i can somehow play it. But it's clearly NOT.) Please fix this and i might my review, thanks.

resulting, in, loss, Really good, beautiful game however when attacking a portal. The samurai or whatever melee troop gets insta killed by the arm and the attack immediately gets cancelled resulting in the loss of all my frontline archers
bought, for, phone, Love it so much I bought a copy for my phone and my pc. In this game you are meant to make mistakes and discover new things without the game explaining what everything does. Its wonderful to explore but you need to be okay with making mistakes. Just don't spend all your gems in one place.

lowered, to, 3, [5 star rating lowered to 3 for design issues] Please fix aspect ratio! Your latest update has changed both landscape and figures into a "wrong end of the telescope" view. I have an 8" tablet and am really struggling to adjust. (I am very nearsighted and even with my glasses off and my face close to the screen, the images are *much* too tiny.) If in-game the "zoom" setting allowed for greater than 1x, it would be fine; ditto for using Android's own zoom. As is, it's unplayable (for me).

drains, like, business, Game is awesome and addictive ! Have almost 24 h of playtime and installed it 4 days ago ! It does need optimisation though , it drains battery like nobody's business. I encountered few glitches too .Builders stand and do nothing around marked trees for cutting . Cleared space before trees , don't allows me to mark them for cutting , trees are simply inactive .

facing, in, directions, It's a nice strategy and casual game but multiplayer is a bit difficult if the screens were facing in different directions it would be easier
communicating, to, player, Its a really cool game and a really nice 2D gameplay mechanic, but it has some real issues with communicating to the player what to do and when. The instruction ghost is only helpful at the start, then later it seems to want to lead you into really dangerous territory and mostly just not say what he meant to say (the docks still occupied with a portal f. example. Then when portal is gone he doesnt even say anything, seems to want you to walk beyond the docks). Game needs an external guide as is

revised, from, 2, Ihave revised my rating from 2 to 3 because I am now seeing the option to skip tutorials. Thank you 😊 I would give 4 stars if a glitch was fixed: sometimes coins and gems randomly fall out of my pouch even if my pouch isn't full. I'd give 5 stars if co-op flipped the top screen. If both screens are facing the same way then how is anyone supposed to play co-op on a phone or tablet?

like, about, game, An Amazing game. What I like about the game is that it has cross-save system between here and to my PC version (steam). I also feel that the game plays better here than the PC version particularly the controls. Overall, I recently finished all 3 versions and I had fun. This is a must but/try becuase its also an addicting one.
play, in, screen, Terrible. Game does not play in full screen...plays on 1/4 size of my screen. Please fix

had, with, it, Great game and lots of fun to play. Recent updates have resolved most of the issues I had with it. I would like a different option for splitscreen where instead of halving the display in landscape, give the option to split it horizontally so each player can play on the ends of the device which makes sense on mobile. Just the option would be nice.

gets, in, way, An amazing game with a feeling of both serenity, calmness and (although sometimes but not commonly - very rarely) pure terror which pushes me back on my seat. An amazing game with no flashy hud that gets in the way of your immersion into its beautiful graphics. I would love it if the Fury team got to work an update to allow custom zooming so I can fully take in my world - just like how it is on the console or PC. Thank you for making this amazing game Fury! I hope you get to work on the zoom! -J

I would love it if the Fury team got to work an update to allow custom zooming so I can fully take in my world - just like how it is on the console or PC. Thank you for making this amazing game Fury! I hope you get to work on the zoom! -J

works, for, reason, Awesome challenging game. Looks great and plays well. Please tweak the controller support because only the mount special attack button works for some reason.
happens, on, islands, Love the game, but there's one glitch that I think won't go away. Most of the time when I destroy a portal, the red moon ends before the counter attack hits my walls. My knights and archers are all outside the walls, and get slaughtered. Is that intended, since it happens mostly on the larger islands?
pay, like, money, 4 stars cause of no male option for deadlands other than that and customization for flag,color,and,character look only has a random instead of getting to pick what you specifically want fix this and it would be a perfect game i did pay id like my money to go to the perfect experience thank you devs

Love, on, console, Love the game on console but I've got a game breaking bug, can't buy shields anymore so I can't send army. Tried to reach the dev without answer. Buy it elsewhere but definitely not here

put, in, surface, Split screen mode doesnt go table top mode, Coop is useless even if i put it in a flat surface to play coop, if the coop is fixed, i'll reconsider buying it again
Fall, onto, ground, Sadly cant spend coins. They just Fall onto the ground. Samsung Galaxy S20 here. Please fix. Absolute 5 Star worthy.
made, for, what, This is what mobile gaming was made for. Great pixel visuals, easy controls and no ads
playing, on, switch, edit: game is unplayable. screen is unresponsive when trying to spend coins. I've been playing the kingdom games on my nintendo switch for years now, but carpel tunnel syndrome has made that difficult. I was so happy to see there's an easy to play mobile version! The minimalistic controls are amazing. This is my favorite game in the world.

paying, for, upgrades, Having an issue with paying for upgrades I tap above the characters head and he just drops all his money and when starting a new game I'm even unable to light the fire because of this, I'm playing on a Xiaomi Mi 10t lite if that helps at all with a speedy fix! Keep doing what you're doing, cracking game other than that issue 👍

working, on, phone, Hello. There's a problem when try to tap the coins. Is not working very well on my phone. I can't enjoy the game. Please fix it. Thanks. This is a good game. ❤️
get, on, mobile, Amazing game I'm in love with the kingdom series so I thought why not get this game on mobile too. Absolutely beautiful pixel art and very fun game play would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes a little strategy.
sink, into, gem, Can easily sink hours and hours into this gem! Works beautifully on Samsung S10+ and S9 Note. No lag, doesn't eat battery and overall is one of the better mobile games out there. I highly recommend the Kingdom games for those who love survival buildings games. Not much in terms of story but still plenty of mysteries to have you solve. Get in!!

work, for, coins, Tap doesn't work for coins, you have to drag
throwing, on, ground, I want to love this game but it is almost impossible to use the coins without first throwing tonnes on the ground. Using coins is fundamental to the gameplay so why is it so hard to get the game just to put them where you want them to go. I hope this fix this issue
is, on, Samsung, The lag is insane on my old phone but on my Samsung there isn't any, needs to be optimized better. Other than that this game is amazing compared to new lands.

Works, on, S10, It's pretty cheap and it's fun. Works great on my S10+. There are some bugs & annoyances, but they're not worth mentioning.
downloaded, on, steam, Great game, also have it downloaded on steam. But the lag in this version is so bad that I can only give it 3 stars.
get, to, screen, I love this game but it is so glitchy. Now I can't get to the menu screen. Only option is do you want to quit or not. Excellent game, but play on another system.

work, on, achievements, I actually love this game, been playing it non stop since I bought it. But none of the Dead Lands content is actually in the game, and I'd like to work on the Dead Lands achievements. I've found nothing about this anywhere, so I'm just writing this review instead.

spend, on, this, Really enjoying this so far. It doesn't hand-hold and this works. It allows you to explore and learn without creating frustration, you'll spend hours on this without even noticing
left, as, choice, Beautiful Game with some critical flaws. Honestly the biggest troubles are the things that the developer has intentionally left unfixed as a "design choice". For example, there is no way to cancel orders once issued. Not joking. One's mind goes to OG Resident Evil fans claiming that the poor camera angles and tank controls make the game 'scary' instead of just unfun. The game is indeed beautiful and satisfying once one comes to terms with its inadequacies. Needs mods so players can fix.

lags, on, device, Absolutely love the game. Even though I played the previous game (New Lands) this one still manages to feel different and has more stuff to unlock and discover. The only thing that is kind of a deal breaker is that it is laggy and has some bugs. It lags even on a premium device which sucks because I've played Bad North and Kingdom NL and those games ran buttery smooth. I hope the Devs fix this so that I can give them 5 stars which I really want to cause they make amazing games.
works, for, Xbox, Very Great Game, But It comes my disappointment with Bluetooth controllers. ONLY works for Xbox or Playstation not Moga Controls.

exploring, on, top, I really enjoy the game. It's really fun just exploring on top of the graphics.
played, on, phone, The best game that I've ever played on a mobile phone. The overall game design makes every penny to be worth.
put, in, something, Tutorial needs an update, apparently when it tells me to tap to put couns in something that is now done by holding and dragging down but the tutorial text does not reflect this and that should be fixed
starts, Like, lag, Its an amazing game but the only problem I have is lag. Like the lag after a while starts to really mess up my gameplay which is kind of annoying. But other than that thing game is quite great. Nvm got a new device games pretty amazing

find, to, day, ive loved kingdom games since they came out and to this day can not find another game so peaceful and amazing, that is why it is such a sad day that i can not play properly because i can not see my map anymore and the lag is so bad i can barely see
put, in, campfire, Can't put coins in the first campfire. No matter how many times I tap it, or where I tap. Using razor phone 2.
has, On, positive, I'm of two minds with this game. On the positive, it has great art and a simple feed back loop that works great and hooks you in. It's fun and engrossing. However, the tutorial is a bit too opaque. It tells you to do things, but you are mostly left guessing as to why, and some things are not explained at all. Second, the most important resource in the game, villager camps, can easily be destroyed and there is no way to cancel that mistake or build something to replace it.
works, in, it, This game is great when it works but months in it had randomly stopped working. Coins can't be assigned to new buildings. Reinstalled three times, no difference.

run, to, right, Archers that "priorities" the left side always run to the right leaving the left side more and more defenseless the more you expand which ends up requiring more archers.
running, for, equipment, Villagers are not running for equipment during the night attack they are wandering around the same loop at castle gate, and my recent campaign I have slum & merchant tent with forest in wall on my 2nd island, the new villager from that slum would not go for available equipment but instead wandering toward the wall and waiting for non existing equipment (spear) even I have hammer and shield ready they just won't go there to pick up

spend, on, games, Like the game, but there seems to be a bug that on saved games I can't spend money.
move, from, island, I would happily rate 5 stars, were it not for lag. By the time you're ready to move on from the second island, the game is all but unplayable. This is very disappointing, though everything else is stellar.
played, on, xbox, It's a great game. I was a fan of the first game and played both on xbox. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the lag. It didnt take long before I was dealing with a lot of it and it ended up costing me some things I needed to keep building my kingdom. The first game ran great so idk why this one is lagging so much.

love, beyond, words, I love this game beyond words. One of my top 10 picks for any platform. The only thing I wish that could be added to the game now is being able to name our kingdoms for save file information. Thank you very much for such an awesome experience.

hate, on, game, Estranging, given Kingdom: New Land's seems to have a more pixle dense visual quality whilst two crowns is very blurry. As if New Land's runs 1080p natively and only 720p on Two Crowns. I won't hate on the game as it's great however the poor quality really gets me to look the other way. If it's fixed then I will definitely buy the game once more but for now I'll be returning and sticking with New Land's. No matter which is more feature rich. I am using the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. At&t model.

get, from, package, This game is a solid classic for mobile gaming you can get days of enjoyment from this kinda small package i beg you to give this game a chance and stay with the game dispite its small learning slope it has.

play, with, friends, I love the new modes and variety of Two Crowns. However, the biggest reason I bought it was to play with friends over wifi or Bluetooth. I hope this a fetaure that will be added soon. Otherwise, 3 stars
connecting, In, setup, The game is great!! but a few things would greatly improve the experience: In my current setup I'm connecting my device to a screen (through DEX), so it would be nice to put both players' view at the same direction (instead of forcing one to be up-side-down, assuming I'm placing my device over a table for both players - one each side); Also, the connected controller seems to forcefully go to the second player only (I'm unable to play with a controller on single player).

having, in, it, Hi, I just bought the game today and having a lot of in it, positive vibes all across the board. But suddenly I got technical difficulties in the form of the game slowing down. it all started when I unlocked the gryffin and used it, the colors on said mount randomly turns negative from time to time. I tried restarting the game but the problem turns up over time. I'm running a 6gb ram 855 snapdragon phone on android 9. It should handle the game smoothly? Can you guys help me with this problem?

run, With, tag, Great gameplay but poor framerate on a Note 9. Lot's of hiccups and stuttering. With a premium price tag, this game should run buttery smooth on any modern flagship phone.

waiting, for, one, It's an amazing game, I played the original and would watch gameplay videos back in 2017 and I absolutely love the graphics and gameplay of it. I've been waiting for this one for over a year and a half when it was announced, I was so hyped for this and now that it's here I'll be playing this one for hours. 5/5 would pay 10 dollars again tbh.

think, with, time, Its great game but the bugs are outrageous. Have 4 weapons ready for the people to pick up, and 6 villagers who are standing next to it ignoring it. Id say that with time i think the issue will be resolved but THIS IS A REPEATING ISSUE FROM THE PREVIOUS GAME THAT STILL HASNT BEEN RESOLVED THERE EITHER
downloaded, for, me, Good game, but took me 30 minutes to download this tiny file of the game, I think it may be my internet, but even bigger games have downloaded faster for me before
play, with, some, I really love this game but I'll like to play with some of my friends so when is the online multiplayer being added?
realized, before, purchasing, Only offer coop in split screen. . I wish I realized this before purchasing because I had hoped to play with my bf when he travels.

played, in, years, Very good game, worth the price, this is one of the top 5 phone games i have played in the last 15 years 🤩
tried, In, beginning, In the beginning I tried to light the campfire but me tapping did nothing, and I close the game to restart to see if it was bugged but the same thing happened and I couldn't drop the coins on the ground.

sucks, for, hours, Gorgeous design. Clean gameplay, it sucks me in for hours at a time.

seems, in, regard, It's a very good game. I just wish the screen ratio would be wider with the S10 rather than a smaller aspect ratio, unlike Kingdom New Lands. It seems a step backwards in that regard :(
look, at, this, I love kingdom I remember playing the very first game of in armor games I think the farmers could attack and archers too it was a god game but now look at this this is 10 times better and I am happy to be alive to play it
recommend, to, fan, Good but seriously flawed. This is one of my favorite games ever on many platforms but it's nearly unplayable on my Galaxy s9 because you can't adjust the zoom. Everything is incredibly tiny (yet smooth) to the point of futility. Until this gets fixed I can't recommend this to even the biggest kingdom fan.
expected, from, franchise, A worthy sequel to kingdom new lands. Wish the multiplayer was online instead of just split screen only. Beautiful pixel art as well as soundtrack as expected from the franchise. Its a great game for passing time.
become, to, laggy, Unfortunantly the game became unplayable on my Lgk 30. I could only make it to island two day seven before it would become to laggy to even upgrade a wood wall to stone. It seemed to happen after expanding my walls a far distance in one go. Would also like to have the ability to zoom in a little more.
tell, for, game, Clunky for 10 dollars. The player should get a much more customizable experience; not even Minecraft is this expensive for a better experience. It has no strategy because it is so monotone and uneventful. The game is barely adventure genre due to all of the boring walking the player is expected to do. From one side of the map to the other. It's a waste of money and time. You can tell its a cash grab for an "indie" game that is boring to say the least. Don't buy it just because it looks pretty.
change, to, 2, Kingdom new lands runs better because it's more zoomed in I wish I could change this to 2 or 3x zoom so I can actually run it, please implement zoom change, please, I own this on switch, pc, and here. ZOOM OPTION IS NEEDED

qualifies, as, game, Although this game qualifies as an actual game (not a lootbox infested Skinner box), it quite often forgets to explain mechanics or convey useful information to the player (e.g. what does the bomb do? What are the controls? Why can't I detonate it?). On top of this, there's very little narrative driving you on to explore any additional islands. Overall, 2 stars because it's at least a game (and a pretty game to boot), but poor UX really holds this title back.

play, without, lag, Great game I love the first one ,but this one has a lot of lag when I play. I believe this game can fix this problem. Please fix this soon I would love to play the game without lag
gets, on, phone, I love this game. The only problem is that on my phone, it gets really laggy. Also, can there soon be an option to change the zoom please. Another thing is if you can also soon add a LAN feature, so playing with friends can be easier. Other than the requests for the game, this is one of my favorite games that I will play for a long time.

shown, from, go, Retro-style graphics and simple mechanics hides a complex and rich gameplay experience. Only issue is that not all controls are shown to you from the get go. Swipe up with one finger to use your mount's ability; swipe up with two fingers to use your character's/monarch's ability.
like, For, example, Great Game but could be better. Reason being there is a lot of things that could be fixed. For example the zoom I would really like to zoom out. Next the fact that two people can play together is amazing! My sister absolutely loves the Griffin. But the split screen is weird. They both are right side up. One of them should be upside down for better and easier game play. Also this might be my device or something but whenever I walk past a decent amount of archers or just people my frames drop FAST

waiting, for, this, This game is too good, been playing the first one for ages patiently waiting for this and it's 99 percent identical to xbox version. Great dev team
playing, in, phone, I absolutely love this game, and it's minimal-input style is perfect for playing in a phone!! However, I can't play too far into the game before the frame rate drops so badly that I can't even make any inputs... It becomes unplayable on my LG Stylo 2 Plus😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

put, into, game, Good value but I think we need the zoom options put back into the game.
play, without, screen, Pls fix my hermit has been stolen and my dog but when i try to find it again i can't see him anymore. I love this game so much and pls make it multiplayer like pc so we can play without split screen on same device

played, in, time, Excellent game. If you only have one hand, you'll still do very well. Crisp graphics. Beautiful sound. The most relaxing game I've played in a long time.
play, with, someone, Great game! I just wish the multiplayer version would allow you to play with someone online not on a split screen.

started, with, issues, Fantastic! It started out with some stability issues and crashing, but they fixed that. It remains one of my favorite games, and plays just as easy as in console, but with the added bonus of being able to put the coins in builds faster! Keep up the awesome work!

tap, on, circles, When I tap on the circles to place a coin to build it hardly ever works. I have to always try it with two fingers, and even then sometimes it doesn't work. The original game worked perfectly fine, this one does not work fine for me.

have, For, example, Awesome, best game ever. Please alter the split screen set up. For example when I click coop please have 3 buttons instead of 2. 1 to remain in single mode, 1 for split screen and 1 for table top split screen. I enjoy playing as 2 characters by myself but when I'm holding the phone I have to hold it in a weird way so it doesn't keep flipping to table top mode. Thanks Raw Fury for an amazing game!

lagging, on, phone, Love this game bit it keeps lagging on my phone
looks, with, style, Never played a Kingdom game before, but somehow I really enjoy it. The pixel art is superb and looks great even with such a minimalistic style. Raw Fury is now on my top publisher lists, such as 505 games. (What's that? There is a crossover with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night called Dead Lands? Sign me up!)
get, on, Pro, This would be the fourth time I purchase this game, but I finally get it on my OnePlus 7 Pro. The addition of monarchs was an exceptional improvement from an already fantastic game, giving it a whole new experience that makes it well worth the price. In this game, you can go about it in any way. I've replayed it numerous times, improving my strategy from the last. It comes with three versions packed in one, essentially giving you three whole experiences. I've had no issues with the gameplay.

zoomed, in, camera, I love this game, everything is perfect except for the zoom in, I dont like how far zoomed in the camera is I cant see the greed until their right next to me and its unsatisfying going through my kingdom with such a short line of view, apart from that I love this game

connect, to, Play, The game is a bit expensive in my country, but its been worthing the money so far. The only problem I'm facing is that I can't connect to Google Play. Every time I try to do it, the game just freezes and stop working. Please, consider fixing it in the future. Despite that, it's a really good and fun game, just like the first Kingdom.

Tested, on, Phone, Tested on a Razer Phone 2. No problems so far. Touch controls are weird, but doable. Some of the instructions for investing money is confusing. To drop coins is a tap, to invest in buildings, equipment, etc. you drag down. Not sure how this would affect my efficiency but it's an alright system. Aside from that, everything looks like regular Kingdom Two Crowns...which of course is amazing for those who enjoy managing towns and defending against monsters. Best check out the wiki if you get lost.

play, with, people, This is like 2.0 of the original. Only thing is in split screen I don't know how you would be able to play with two people on a touchscreen if you weren't using actual controllers. I hope RawFury sees this though because it would be amazing if they added an option to flip the top screen so that you could play split screen with someone who is sitting opposite you at a table on the same device or have true multi-device multiplayer. Edit: holy shiz it has the dlc like the PC version, I love it!!!

came, for, Android, I was very excited with this game actually! I even pre subscribed so I knew when it came out for Android! I expected the quality to be just like the previous kingdoms game for Android that I actually really liked, but instead I get nothing but a glitchy laggy game play, the game is almost as if it's zoomed out? When I even press the menu button the options are so tiny and unreadable I don't even know what they say! Needless to say I'm already tired if the game crashing, honestly want my $ back
нельзя, с, другом, В игре нельзя играть с другом на разных устройствах. ☹️
waiting, for, this, Been waiting for this.
having, from, get, Just installed this and I'm having trouble from the get go. I can't add the initial 3 coins to start the first camp. The total hand is there but it won't let me do anything. This stinks.
