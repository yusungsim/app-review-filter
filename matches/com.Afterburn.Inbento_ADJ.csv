game, fun, This was a fun little puzzle game, definitely worth the price I paid. I would kind of like a hint system for times when I'm truly stuck but honestly that's not much of a game breaker. Part of the game experience is a bit of challenge. I'd definitely consider buying another puzzle game from this studio

game, previous, I liked Golf Peaks, the previous game by this developer, so I was looking forward to this one. It's just as good in my opinion, with interesting mechanics that are gradually introduced. Some puzzles I was able to solve easily, but others really required some creative thinking and experimentation. If you like puzzle games, I think this one is worth the price. I'll be keeping an eye out for any future games that they make!

experience, perfect, I was hesitant to buy this game, since the trailer and pics didn't make it super clear what to expect, but I am so glad I bought it and 100% recommend you go ahead and purchase if you've been on the fence about it. I've already been suggesting it to my friends left and right. It's the perfect puzzle experience. Very mellow, perfectly challenging without ever feeling frustrating, it's got real "let's take a few minutes to avoid thinking about how crappy 2020 has been" vibes.
game, Cute, Cute puzzle game but in level 2-7 apparently there is piece missing on the google play version of this game. If you go on YouTube it'll shown the Nintendo version and there should be 2 piece of tuna in the middle of the bento box. Overall a good game but I thought I was losing my mind for a sec🙃

puzzle, little, Pretty much a perfect little puzzle game - starts out very simple while teaching you the mechanics, but quickly gets challenging. Two minor suggestions to the dev: 1) The swipe length to change image panels is a bit longer than normal swipe gestures, and it feels a little awkward (literally my only complaint) 2) This game is begging for some kind of bento-pedia that tells you what each different square type is. It's fun to guess, but there are a couple I couldn't figure out

graphics, cute, Love the cute graphics and especially the cats. The puzzles are fun too. However the last two levels are really challenging, would love to have a hint function of sorts.

gripe, Only, Very fun. Only gripe is the difficulty curve. First half of the levels were far too easy, and around chapter 9 or 10 it starts getting difficult. Feels like a lot of levels were wasted on teaching mechanics.

amount, right, If you are into relaxing puzzles, you will love this game, and it will love you back. A gem made with love. Casual and cute with just the right amount of challenge. Every level is interesting.
gripe, only, Really cute puzzle game with cats in which you need to put together inbento boxes to solve the puzzle. My only gripe is there are no hints so only way to get help is to find a YouTube video or cheat website, then you don't get a hint you get the solution.

game, brilliant, Adorable, brilliant game - I love every detail of it! The gameplay is very simple and nice, without a single aggravating feature (this is coming from a very picky puzzler). The pictures are SO CUTE, and they come together really well to make a great story; I absolutely love the cat voices - they are really cute and sweet. New features are introduced very well and at a good, steady pace, and there is just the right amount of difficulty. The secret puzzle at the end is very nice as well.

difficulty, impossible, The art is super cute, and the puzzles are super fresh too! Sometimes, difficulty escalates a bit too much, but it's not flat out impossible difficulty. This game doesn't have hints though, and I think that having slight bit of hints when the player get stuck for too long might be good. Otherwise, the controls are so smooth and responsive, combined with cute arts and I've fallen in love, eagerly waiting for new contents.

option, only, I really love this game, but I wish there was something to keep you from getting stuck. I've been on 04.09 for a couple weeks, & since the levels are locked & there's no hints, my only option (in order to keep playing) is to cheat. Aside from that qualm, this is a beautiful little puzzler to get lost in :)

game, stellar, stellar puzzle game. none of the mechanics are ground breaking but it all works. the challenge is there and the graphics are cute. would recommend for all puzzle lovers.
game, mobile, Another quality mobile game by Afterburn. Well worth the purchase price.
pieces, new, This puzzle game is surprisingly short for $3. There are 109 puzzles but I'd rate less than 30 challenging. The game uses levels to introduce new pieces that's are solved in less than 4 moves. The gameplay time to beat this is about 2 hours, I'd assume. I was a little disappointed by the music and hoped for cute cat treat recipes to go with this game as extras. The game isn't terribly replayable except passing to a friend and see them struggle a bit, but I rather save the 100mb. 2hr content = 2

Edit: Didn't know it's from the same developer of Golf Peaks! I purchased that game too. I really love puzzle games, can't wait for what you have to offer this year! :)

game, Wonderful, Wonderful puzzle game! Similar to Golf Peaks, it was smooth sailing most of the time but a few levels had me scratch my head for a while. And by "while", I mean weeks. So definitely worth the price!

puzzles, more, The game itself is well made. Graphics are simple but it fits well. The puzzles (and available moves) are well thought through and there's not really anything 'bad'. I'm giving 4 stars because I fail to be captivated, to come back to complete more puzzles. I can't name what the dev should do to change that.
puzzles, available, I have completed the 108 available puzzles. Some great brain teasers to wrap my head around with the odd 'out of the box' solution if you'll pardon the pun. Very much enjoyed it. It has left me a little curious though as the game suggests there is one level I haven't yet completed as it states 108/109 at the bottom and the pictures list gives 22/23. Is there something I am missing or is there more content to come? Edit after developer reply: Oh wow I really missed that! Thank you 😄

game, cute, At last! It has taken me awhile, but I finally found a fun (and cute) puzzle game that's all about giving the player a good time, instead of trying to push in-app purchases and ads on us. Thank you! Well spent money!

game, challenging, A challenging puzzle game with cats. Really like it, but it's too hard for my poor brain. Barely reached world 8 and I'm now stuck there. Would appreciate if there is a way to get a hint. It doesn't have to be an obvious hint, just something to start with. Although even without any hint, this game is already pretty good

game, great, Thank you for a great game!
game, beautiful, I should note first that Inbento is a beautiful game. Everything that was great about Golf Peaks is present here: wordless, smartly designed tutorial stages that introduce concepts, a tranquil, calming visual and audio aesthetic, and a very confident difficulty curve that ramps up smoothly. The visuals are minimalist but utterly charming, and the gameplay simple but compelling. The reason I am giving this three stars vs. the five I rated Golf Peaks is...I just don't find it as fun. And the main reason is how difficult it is to iterate on solutions to levels. Once they get complex, it can be difficult to identify which "layer" of pieces need to go in first (blocks, pieces to move blocks, etc.), and as a result I was more often than not starting stages from scratch - rather than backing up a few moves - to start a new approach. This quickly grew very frustrating. About midway through the game now, I have hit a particularly complex level and gotten stuck, cold. Been stuck for days, but while Golf Peaks stumped me now and then, that game was always fun to go back and iterate on my approach to solve it, and I cleared all levels, including the newly released challenge course. Here, that process just isn't as fun because of the need to reset over and over. This might be a way of saying the game is too hard for me - it is - but there's something about the main design that made solving the levels much of an enjoyable process than others puzzlers I've played; the process of slowly dialing in on a solution and then cracking it, just wasn't there for me. It clearly is for others, so YMMV.

ways, many, Bought this because I liked golf peaks so much. Inbento is similar in many ways: same intuitive controls, fun to solve puzzles and a clear sense of progression. Starts very easy, but with 100+ levels it gets pretty tough as you get more pieces. Very well recommended.
