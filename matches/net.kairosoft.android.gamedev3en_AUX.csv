's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game, wish there was more content.
's, way, great, It, It's fun, great way to pass time.
is, game, solid, it, Well, It's GDS. After 10 years it is still a solid game, though more content wouldn't hurt.
is, game, best, This, Been playing this game for years. I still enjoy starting a new company. This is probably the best game of the company. Second would be Grand Prix Story. Definitely good purchase.
is, game, simple, This, This is honestly just a simple and pretty addictive game. I have spent too much time playing it already.
's, way, fun, It, I always come back to this game. It's such a fun way to spend some downtime!
is, game, fun, This, This is such a fun game! Your first time might be a little rough as you're figuring it out, but its still fun to try and make the best games you can and try and figure out genres to put together <3
's, game, sweet, It, It's a pretty sweet game you get hooked quick... I just wish there was more
's, game, good, It, It's a good game! I wish there were more offices to move into. Also it can be super frustrating when an equipment failure or a blackout happens just as you're about to release a super good game. Either way it's an enjoyable game.

's, game, mindless, it, Addicting but limited I have a lot of fun playing. It's addicting but after a bit very repetitive. it's a fun mindless game to play
'm, ðŸ¤£, addicted, I, This game seems like it is simple, but completely not! I'm so addicted ðŸ¤£
is, game, great, This, This is a great game. Very simple and a great time saver.
's, notch, top, it, I've played this for years on and off. Always great to come back to. Only thing I wish it had is more transparency on the mechanics of stuff. But it's still top notch and worth every penny.
's, manage, micro, It, I could play this game all day. Some times I do! It's very micro manage but simple enough not to be to confusing.
were, consoles, more, they, Great game but wish they were more consoles to make games for
's, game, mindless, it, Addicting but limited I have a lot of fun playing. It's addicting but after a bit very repetitive. I would love to be able to carry a person I've hired from one play through to the next, or have more variety in the game play loop. But overall, it's a fun mindless game to play.
's, way, good, it, Pretty entertaining game although it feels fairly limited and repetitive at times, could be better in a few ways but overall, it's a good way to pass some time.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game and easily passes the time.
's, playthrough, new, it, Played this game 3 times and I love it like it's a new playthrough every single time!
is, game, cute, this, this is a really cute and addictive game, I remember playing this with my friends back when I was 8 I think. it's still just as fun as I remember it <3
is, game, great, This, This is a great game, I have been on it off and on for years but know they really need to add some new stuff to it.
's, game, great, It, It's a great mobile Sim game. This was Karisoft at its best, before they charged a premium PLUS IAP! Sad how greedy they have become..

's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. But the frequency at which random accidents (equipment failure, power outage, etc.) occur is literally every game. At least once sometimes twice. Which makes it almost impossible to get a hall of fame game
is, concept, neat, It, It is a neat and fun concept. However, the game needs more added to it as it feels half finished. It is missing more late game options. Once you get past the threshold, you are only chasing to try and get the game of the year award. Once that was achieved, I was never awarded the million dollars :(
is, tycoon, adorable, It, It is an adorable video game tycoon!
was, game, 1st, This, Wow cant believe i didnt review yeqrs ago. This was my 1st game of game development and absolutely love this game. Art style, sound and UI is great
's, game, great, It, It's a great game which I enjoyed. So much so I looked for other similar games by this developer to play. My personal favourites are this and Grand Prix story. Perfectly suited for a mobile gaming experience.
was, one, original, this, Awesome game. Played Game Dev Tycoon (from other company) many years ago, I didn't know this was the original one.
was, game, first, This, I love Kairosoft games! This was the first game I beat throughout the series. I 100% recommend it.
'm, fan, huge, I, Great concept. I'm a huge fan of these types of games, but it just didn't make the cut. I played for about 30 minutes and then uninstalled.
is, game, best, this, Love the game but it's been years when will you guys release game dev story 2 on Android?all of these sequels but this is your best game honestly
's, 7.5/10, solid, It, Really great game. An organic and addicting gameplay loop, generally deep progression and only a SLIGHT misunderstandings of how the gaming market works. It's a solid 7.5/10, so I'll give it 4 stars. Recommended, even if you need to pay.
am, game, new, I, I love the game but I am in year 12 and every new game I make theres a blackout or something that takes nearly all of my points from the game Im making so now non e of the games i am making are good and its making me lose the game..... I can understand if there's a black out every now and then but every single game that I make.... it starting to get irritating.
is, example, great, this, Great game and should be celebrated for actually being a game you can buy, own and enjoy on your phone. In a sea of pay to play/win games that have infected mobile gaming this is a great example of how to do it right.
's, blast, absolute, It, So I've played this game before. It's an absolute blast. Or it would be if it even loaded. Infinite loading screens suck, and having to pay money to stare at a game that doesn't even open is essentially theft. You sold me a defective product. On top of that, I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it fixed the issue. I'm now being asked to pay twice for a piece of content I've already purchased and own. Is this legit how you treat customers?
is, game, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic game, addictive and rewarding most times. It definitely needs a sequel! It would be great with a more detailed manual or insights into the inner workings of your choices though, and methods to mitigate frustrating rng failures (like buying a battery backup system for those power outages).

's, game, first, it, When will you release a new game on mobile?? Still playing this game after however many years and it's always the first game on a new phone.
's, finish, able, It, Everything is great about the game. It's finish able within a day, addictive for a while and isn't pay to win. There's almost no sign of advertising and as far as I'm concerned it is a good little game that isn't complex and passes the time sufficiently. However, the manual for the game isn't specific enough, especially in the more advanced parts of the game like how to get a hardware engineer, and I feel like there should be more in terms of the offices you can move into.

is, game, phenomenal, This, This is a phenomenal game, the only downfall is that you can't play offline.
is, game, best, This, This is THE best game for any phone. The graphics are amazing, the story is great but in my opinion to short, I would love it to be longer. The mechanics of the game are the real deal of the game.
is, game, great, It, I saw my friend play this game and it looked fun, so I bought it too! It is a great game. :)
is, game, casual, This, This is a casual game, not for the gamers per say like myself but i sometimes find this sort of thing passes the time... which is completely ok. so if you like a casual game relax and have cup of coffee with during work break,ect this not a bad choice and bonus you pay once which good value for money if your fed up with paying tons only to be asked for more and more this is refreshing that aspect. so value is how i rate this. try it
is, game, great, This, This is a great game if you like tycoon games the only issue is when you get pro devs you will make 4 games in a year with rates over 8 and no challenge at the end. Also you dont dev. Online games =(
was, game, great, It, It was a great game and I don't find any bug
was, game, nice, It, It was a very nice game and appealed a lot of its self to cartoony players but what i had a weird time with was the fact that thwre was nothing to do after you made hundreds of millions of dollars
is, game, addictive, This, This is the most addictive game on the market! Completely worth the money!
's, game, best, It, It's by far the best game ever made.
's, game, great, it, Honestly it's a great game. It runs smooth and I haven't had any issues this far. If you need time to kill this game is definitely for you.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game but too short imo. I've finished the game in one day and after that it just a repetitive process. Well i guess it's worth the money.
was, experience, great, it, Great game for passing time. I really enjoy the game but wish it would get updated to add parodies of the newer generation of consoles such as PS4 and Xbox One. But overall, it was a great gaming experience.
is, game, nice, This, This is a very nice Game Dev Simulation game, the controls are bit clunky and can get annoying at times, but the overall concept and way it works is great, I suggest this to everyone who wants to try a Game Developer Simulator with simple graphics.
's, game, fun, it, One of my all time favorite simulation games on the market. I find myself coming back to it over the years and I'm glad I purchased it. Once you're at the top there's not much else to do but restart with all the genres you've discovered and leveled up to see if in 20 years you can best your previous score. It's great that the game continues after 20 years but sucks that it doesn't keep track after. Either way it's a fun game that you can dedicate some time to. Hopeful for updates or a sequel.
is, game, great, this, this is a great game!
's, flaw, only, That, Too short. That's the only flaw I can find.
