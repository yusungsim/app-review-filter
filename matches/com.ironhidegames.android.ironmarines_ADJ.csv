game, Great, Great game but i cant support it, cause purchasing anything with googleplay account is invalid here.
fun, super, Not what I was expecting, but this is super fun. One of the most addictive games I've played. No money no problem you just have to grind 10 times harder, makes it more fun and worth while when you do get items.

complaint, only, I cannot believe that Ironhide can do RTS so well. It's such a joy to play this game, and it is so engaging! Highly recommended. My only complaint is that it's too short! ;)

update, more, Pla give more update n mission
game, good, It's a good game. Wish it had some more missions, but they can be very challenging, which is good and are well designed. Giving 4 stars because of a really really really annoying bug(?) Where it doesn't save what hero you were playing with last time you played so everytime it resets to the default guy and you have to go into the hero menu and reselect when you start the game again. Please fix this. It's not a problem in Kingdom Rush, so I'm not sure why it's a problem here.

none, less, Like StarCraft but simbler none the less it's worth all the way
gameplay, Snappy, Everything Ironhide puts out is so good! Ive played all the Kingdom Rush games and was curious how the switch from tower defense to RTS would go, and they nailed it. Snappy gameplay, great art, fantastic sound!!

gold, more, I like the game but why it is so hard to grind gold in this game please raise or put more gold when i am finishing a mission
content, more, Hello dev i hope this game will have more content.

game, Best, Best RTS game for the phone definitely worth the money
adventures, more, Love it. I want more adventures
game, mobile, Perfect if multiplayer. (Because it's so good though, still giving it 5 stars) It's basically all that you would want in a mobile RTS. It's as if Starcraft had been made into a mobile game from scratch!
controls, easy, Fun strategy easy controls
game, good, It's a good game it's just that there are too many things for me to focus on but it is still pretty cool and you should try it.

heroes, unlockable, It's worth 2.99, would of liked to see more unlockable heroes. That kinda ruined it for me. Nothing really to work towards your just completing levels to complete them, the game is fun to play. But not much life to it. You unlock your final hero about 15 mins into playing the game. Then all that's left is challenges and those are just check off boxes. You could keep playing to unlock everything in the skill tree. But once again that gets old pretty quick...Missed opportunity. IMO

game, Great, Great little game. Easily worth the couple bucks. Its definitely got a starcraft vibe, but i enjoy that about it. You have to pay for other heros but they do have sales on them and, sales aside, there all under 10$. No pay to win BS. Everything feels balanced but challenging. Would definitely recommend it FOR THE DEVS: is the ape Darwin a reference to the Nirvana song Very Ape? Just curious

characters, additional, Good little RTS, you still have to pay for additional characters so thats a bit of a bummer. The developers have a good sense of humor and you'll see some hilarious cameo appearances. Overall it was pretty fun.

grabbers, typical, For a P2P game, it has locked heroes behind a paywall and progress is a lot taken after f2p games, including micro-transaction for boosts. Yes, you can complete without paying but the design feels like a f2p game with the intent of people buying microtransactions and heroes. It is a shame, had hopes to play a premium rts game, instead it has baked in the typical f2p money grabbers, it just ruins it.

game, fun, IT OBVIOUSLY TAKES AFTER STARCRAFT 游때 so far it's a very fun little game that I can play anytime that I want to, the graphics are certainly good and they're hidden gems it seems on every level (like Jean-Luc Picard hiding in plain sight) I'm not going to give five stars because I only really just started playing... But so far it's a very good game with easy to learn controls and the combat looks good too.

game, good, Very good game. Although it has some micro transactions, it's not pay to win. The RTS elements work well on a phone. And although I like their tower defence games, I like this way better.

quality, few, Really enjoying this game. A few quality of life changes. The commander resets everytime i close the game. Defults back to the first one which is annoying. Also, when you make your formation and then select all to move them, it would be awesome if the squads remembered their ordering/placement. I normally have snipers in the back but when i move all. Snipers run to the front because they think their rangers and its really annoying. Minor niggles otherwise one of my fav games!!

gsme, Nice, Nice gsme but heroes arent free
ones, free, It sucks that you don't allow a trial of your heros before purchase. Basically paid so much for a hero which is way weaker and vulnerable than free ones. What was even bshind this?! Even more ridiculous, one can't ask for a refund.

points, faster, Not really a pay to win, just need to grind a bit, like playing a mission twice to get faster tech points. No need to spent additional money except if you want the Premium Heroes, but you do not need one to finish the game. Saving tips : buy it once you reach world 3 for big discounts. Pros : + Fun RTS games on Tablet + Nicely drawn + Cheap full game Cons : - Not enough missions, it got 49 missions, but most mission is 15-30 mins each, so easily beat the game in 3 days. - Paid Premium Heroes

game, great, It's a great game but there needs to be a free way to earn more heroes. You only get 3 free ones and the rest are locked behind a paywall. I ended up buying them all myself for a little sale deal but it ended up costing me more than triple the initial game price. At the very least make the heroes cheaper. Only reason I spent so much on a mobile game was because I liked it so much. It doesn't matter if you can beat the game with the free heroes or not. We paid for the game and want the full game.

fan, Big, Big fan of the games you guys make, for anyone who plays Kingdom Rush you'll enjoy the ingame graphics as they in keep with familiar art styles which are excellent! The game play is smooth and offers multiple options to create your own paths for upgrades. It's a shame you have to pay for better "heros" as the selection is quite limited. Over-all fun game, and would recommend the buy, purely on the basis of the concept and art style.

Worth it compared lots of games claiming there free yet need money to advance. Thanks to the devs. Keep making great premium games, I don't mind spending money for a great and complete game. Thanks

reviews, bad, Incredible Game!!! The gameplay is incredibly fun! Its very unique and cheap! I see some people giving it bad reviews because some people think you need to buy heroes to beat the game which is not true at all. I beat the game on the hardest difficulty without spending a dime. THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN! (Which is incredibly rare these days) I can only highly recommend this game. Incredibly super super fun!

content, new, Still 5* RTS style game imho, but I will admit, the lack of new content since I've installed the game does kind of suck. The fact the characters are locked behind a paywall, albeit I went ahead and bought them after I beat the entire thing, other than achievements. All missions are done and I'm progressing to do them on the hardest diff, and it's def possible if you know how how play an RTS, no need to pay-to-win. The only lackluster part is no new content or custom game mode, & locked chars.

heros, available, Great Game, too much locked behind a paywall. There are 3 heros available with about 7 locked behind a paywall, with some costing as much as the game itself. To add to that frustration, every time you clear a stage you get a 'Hero Unlocked' notification, with no heros actually unlocking.
purchases, further, Seemed decent, until I bought the game and then they had further purchases in game. Screw you guys.
game, cool, Very cool game. Really awesome rts style game for mobile

device, mobile, It's as good of an RTS as you'll find for a mobile device. Lots of different units and strategies to try. Lots of different types of missions. Definitely worth the money. Controls can be a bit tricky, but that might just be cause I'm older

rts, Most, More than worth the price. Most optimized rts I've played on mobile. Yes, there is an option to purchase additional heroes, but you will do more than fine with what's provided. I do plan on purchasing a few to show some love to the developers and get a little extra fun in the process.

game, Nice, Nice game
maps, larger, If this game had a sandbox/endless mode with larger maps it'd be 100% perfect.
heroes, more, Worth the $2.99 and did not need to purchase more heroes to beat all the levels. Overall the game is a little short, but fun.
gameplay, cheapen, Unfortunately, despite charging a premium for this game, the developer also expects some players to spend possibly hundreds of dollars on in-game items. Not only does this needlessly cheapen gameplay, but it is arguably the least morally responsible path for a developer to take. This game is strongly reminiscent of Starcraft, so if that's your bag, and you don't mind the possibility of giving the developer many times over what this game is worth, then you might enjoy it.

gripe, biggest, I do enjoy parts of this game, like it's art style and progression system, however my biggest gripe is with the controls. So far as I know there's no grouping for units and each unit has to be micro managed around the map. It becomes tedious fast. Grouping is an important feature of most RTS and for good reason.

game, great, Absolutely great game. This game balances perfectly between real time strategy and tower defense. It's challenging enough, and exciting at the same time so I don't bother to grind the levels again and again to level up heroes. The graphic is good as others of the same studio. Thank the Ironhide Studio for another great game. Can't wait to try Junkworld.

lil, Great, Great lil RTS, it's one my most played games. But buying new heroes kinda feels empty. Every new hero you buy should unlock more content like their origin story campaigns in their native homeworlds. Along with the comics to tell the lore. Please do not let this game die. Make more content. People are ready to pay for it.

fun, Pretty, Pretty fun actually. High replay value. Only gripe is the lack of free heroes, and the cost of the others, but also kind of understandable with how much game there actually is in here. Just could be cheaper, or have the bundle option always available, just in case.

game, boring, What a boring game. I do not recommend buying it. It's silly. Kingdom Rush is the only good game from these developers. But this game is a waste of time and money. If I could put 0 stars on it, I would.

experience, linear, Was really excited for a mobile RTS but at the start you were really limited in what you could do. It was a very linear experience and I didn't want to play for more than an hour

reliance, more, Really fun. I wish it had more building reliance and allows us to play where buildings go like a true RTS. Also a save game feature. Its mobile and has even more likely you'll have to unexpectedly put the game down.

game, Good, Good game with nice general concepts. The execution is off in some areas. I feel like the planets got progressively worse with the last one being my least favorite. Spawning is often times random and you will have games where enemies will swarm your base or actively recapture points. Then replay the same map and they won't anymore. I don't like how all your soldiers and aliens don't feel particularly strong against enemies. 3/5

sort, good, It's good sort of challenging
type, Quite, Quite new type of gameplay for ironhide studios and yet manage to pull it off great, i will wait for the next chapter, i suggest adding daily missions where it refresh every so often and its levels are different everytime and even different on the campaign. "And for sake ironhide add the ENCYCLOPEDIA!"

difficulty, normal, Would give 5 but only giving us 3 heros out of 10 seems a bit unfair considering we pay for the game it's like after I get the ghost guy that's it which kinda sucked a little but other than that it's great I've almost 100% completed a normal difficulty
levels, First, First few levels are very good. Really detailed work with chock full of easter eggs. Cons- Free Heroes are limited... Game is big... Then it becomes a drag if you're not really interested. Overall I liked it and thanks to Dev team!!!!

characters, 11ish, Fun but characters are expensive... 11ish characters between $2.99 and $6.99 each
difficulty, high, Its boring even on high difficulty no upgrades. For any normal person who ever played StarCraft or any other rts. Also cotrols is older than starcraft 1 that was released almost 20 years ago. Micro managing units is awful no mini map or anything. Units are not balanced higher difficulty is not higher it just makes game more boring cause enemies die longer.

game, great, So... This is a great game and everything, but... is Fate human or empyrean? This is bugging me so much and I can't sleep.
game, Cool, Cool game. I enjoy games like this. I can play it for hours. Only thing I don't like is that they still use your info even though you have to pay for the game.
need, real, Combat system is well designed as well as talent trees & extras, there's no real need to buy anything for money as long as you're willing to grind a bit, no errors so far. On the other hand, I would like to see more building types, levels, as well as units & hero's available in turn for progressing the game. Moreover, It would be great to see muliplayer modes as well as custom modes (perhaps something similar as in StarCraft) also being able to play as the robotic or swarm faction.

ways, different, It's very fun and engaging. Lots of different ways to play each level and works offline. Would be better if more heroes were included.

Time, good, This is a phone game so you can't expect starcraft. I still had the vibe of starcraft and the graphics are great. I like how they have simplified this games format but made it feel immersive. You don't have to pay anything. I paid $8 extra for a hero I didn't have to I already beat the game with the three heroes they give you. Wanted to buy the hero because I had a good Time and I really appreciated that considering most of these games nowadays suck and want money consistently.
advertising, False, False advertising. Not at all like the ad.

content, more, I love the game and I hope that there will be more campaign content in the next patch or so... This game is one of the best Strategy games I've ever played. It does need some other ways to control units. For Experienced strategists like me, the campaign is a little too short. The story however, is very Interesting. I'd like to redo the campaign with different difficulty but when I change it... It seems to be the completed one but harder... I'd like the devs to change this pls. 5 star review.

rts, mobile, The path finding can be annoying and the unit selection is tedious but I can't really blame the game cause it's a mobile rts. None the less a very polished and fun game!

encounter, brutal, I downloaded the game while watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Unwillingly and not knowing that I'm already in the Order of the Phoenix part when I realized the Iron Marines' brutal encounter on this Signos 5 level. Hence, this game is a total conscious taker, 5 star.

commander, full, Very nostalgic, almost warcraft feel to this ...not a tower defense like the rest of their games...full commander style makes for a much more expansive, and explorable environment...the buildable bases could use a few more options, and a bit more focus....I love TD, but I grew up with this stuff..........add a couple more planets and we can talk FIVE stars....

companies, modern, Good, not great! Heroes WAY too expensive. Ironhide like most modern game companies are too greedy and we gamers are too weak and spend too much!

The prices of some of these "micro transactions" are not exactly "micro", and together they add up to the cost of a FULL AAA title. PURE & UNECESARY GREED!

mode, normal, I bought this game because I liked the kindom rush games they made but this game is kinda OK. I gave this game a chance and I liked it but than it just got way to hard to play because all The enimes were way to strong and my guys were so weak and I was just on normal mode. This game just isn't for me but if you like this type of game than get it because Iron hide makes some of the best games for the Google play store.

games, other, I love their other tower defense games. This is a bit different though. Its like their old style had a baby with Starcraft. This will become very clear when playing. Its very enjoyable.

heroes, free, I'm enjoying it so far. The free heroes seem good enough to beat the game with. There are heroes you can buy, but it feels more like a choice than a necessity. So I'm happy about that.
experience, overall, While this game looks really good, I find the overall experience and game play of their kingdom rush games more fun to play.

edit, bad, No bad, edit: lost interest after getting stuck. No way to get back into it.
difficulty, casual, I paid for this game and the casual difficulty should be alright but is not, when you passed few words, is getting harder and you can't do something, is already casual difficulty, for what reason? Even says hero unlocked but is no one heroes unlocked, all costs money idk why it says heroes unlocked.

game, good, Pretty good game. A little surprised to find our the rest of the game costs $40 but the part you get for.$2.99 is good.
time, great, I'm having a great time with this game. The hero units are unique.

levels, awesome, The game is really cool because not only the fact that it has awesome levels but also special levels where you not only have to defender attack but also rescue someone to the safe point. Boss fights are amazing and I like how creative the levels are. I would really be happy if the developers add another world or make it a online game 游뱅游뱅游뱅

games, rare, One of the nowadays rare strategy games which is both very good (try to beat everything on impossible after upgrades) and does not try to empty your wallet
game, good, Although there are in game transactions, you don't have to pay to win. Glad to see developers that are not money hungry and want to create a good game.
game, great, Wow. Such a great game.
game, Great, Great game , very fun and nice humor...just wish the graphics were a tad little better.
game, enjoyable, A repetitive yet enjoyable game. However, it is much more a tower defense than an RTS game. Also, the in-game monetisation scheme is abusive당ay too much content is hidden behind paywalls.

money, more, Sucks that after buying the game you then have to shell or more money to use any but the basic hero's, it's usually one way or the other.

game, worst, Someone pls kill me!!?? It is the worst game from Ironhide studios. I love strategy but in this game dexterity is important. Fighting bosses is extremely tedious.
hours, countless, 5 star game, countless hours spent on ironhide games. Only complaint is the hero costs, maybe a bundle to get them all for a cheaper price to solve that? but amazing game in literally every other aspect. The references to other scifi movies and such are hilarious just as a last note.

skills, unique, This game has everything a classic tower defence game has and much more. Heroes with unique skills, different troops with different speciality, weakness and strength creating diverse play style. But there are suggestions I hav, like showing the hp of the shields when they are taking damage, making another option for relocating troops and heroes by selecting them and clicking on desired location, changing the appearance on the towers and refineries as they are upgraded. Adding skin for heroes.

Well balanced, decent graphics, and fun with the occasional challenge. I only wish there were more planets/and or missions. Ironhide Studios; thank you and keep up the good work.

Though, as you gain more knowledge and experience, you will surely want to challenge yourself and increase the difficulties. In short, this game needs a sequel. I hope Iron Hide would considered this. Thank you very much for your hard works, commitment and dedication towards making a very enjoyable and fun games.

rts, Best, Best casual rts for phones. Uses simple, easy to understand mechanics and has a fair learning curve that introduces new units and mechanics at a good pace. The unit system gives 3 subclasses to each category of unit that can be changed out on the fly to fill different rolls as each mission goes on, giving the player opportunity to adapt to surprises even on the first try at a mission. This is a case study on how to build an rts from the ground up for a phone.

time, real, A fun take on tower defense & real time strategy games. Quirky heroes (3 can be upgraded, rest are premium) lead the fight against aliens in 3 distinct world maps with lots of side missions to challenge your commander skills. Simple touch controls direct the action ingame. There are RPG style perma upgrades for your troops in battle you get just by playing. Unique comic book style presentation of the campaign is great with tons of pop-culture references. Good sound & soundtrack design.

storylines, Decent, Pros: - This is as close as it comes to a mobile RTS. - Well made. - Decent storylines. Cons: - Doesnt take long to complete whole campaign on hardest differculty avaiable. - Not worth replaying on differculty unlocked by completing campaign, once you've maxed characters and tech tree it becomes easy and boring. - Most heros require ingame purchase and unreasonably priced. - The final boss is a joke. A requirement to beat him is luck. Needs: - PvP would make this a top-tier mobile RTS.

I hope there is a pvp or multi-player on this, would love to chose between aliens and humans, and do pvp RTS battles like Art of War 3 or Red Alert pvp game plays.

games, best, One of the best strategy games that I have ever played, it's awesome, it's not pay to win kind of game, I spent only 120 and I was able to clear entire game. You need to be good with strategy though. All those people who are ranting about this game being pay to win should seriously questions their abilities first. Overall great gaming experience, it's non addective and fun. Loved it

fan, Big, Big fan of the series and this one is even stunningly better. The game is gradually difficult but after playing over again for many times you'll figure out the best strategy to win. In my opinion the game is balanced and well designed with great attentions to graphics and sounds, plus the little ingame achievements. I paid two discount packages of two heroes and really enjoyed the characters. Great job.

game, amazing, The studios made an amazing game. The different story and the fakt that you can move your troops on the whole map is very amazing. The design of the game is very intresting and I would like to know who has the idea for the look of the enimies. Of cause the insiders exist. Sometimes the handling of the troops is difficult, but in case of the loveable story, I gave this game 5 stars.

challenge, excellent, Great RTS. Graphics and UI are good. A excellent challenge and can be won without any in game purchases. You can also adjust the difficulty if needed and it wasn't. You can unlock the 1st three heros and still have a very enjoyable experience. Long time gamer so I'm hard to impress. So many other games out there require ingame purchases to win, this is not one if them unless you want to clear it in a day and then what's the point. No bugs either in my experience. Keep up the awesome dev!

building, basic, It is a basic yet fun little RTS that combines basic base building in the form of capture points with tower defense elements and spawn able units, as well as heroes you can call to the field during missions. I don't want to say much more as to not spoil anything, so check out this well made game and have fun playing a legitimately fun mobile RTS, it is worth at least one full playthrough.

games, other, There is a bug that makes it so that your hero automatically damages things when playing Spec Op White Fangs. This continues until you minus out the game, even if you start another level. It's like she's using a fire raad explosion on the enemies, but without the graphics. This does not detract enough from the game to make it three stars though. Also, you have an encyclopedia in your other games, why not this one.

Don't act like you're a "premium" game and then lock content behind additional microtransactions, that's the most garbage behavior and completely unforgivable. The devs should be ashamed.

Its all around just a fun and fair RTS. There are a seemingly limitless number of tower defense games to choose from but ive not come across very many legit RTS games on mobile so its a nice surprise, ive always loved TD, RTS, and strategy games in general since I was little so this game so far has been a very pleasant surprise.

There are a seemingly limitless number of tower defense games to choose from but ive not come across very many legit RTS games on mobile so its a nice surprise, ive always loved TD, RTS, and strategy games in general since I was little so this game so far has been a very pleasant surprise.

trick, Huge, Huge confidence trick. There appear to be 2 versions of this game. 1. Purchased & with in game purchases 2. Available via Google Play Pass with no upfront cost & no in game purchases possible. I've been playing the 2nd version. Previously able to get to level 7 within the game before hit a brick wall thats impossible to get pass even on casual play (the lowest). And because there are no in game purchase, that appears to be it - a very short game indeed. 4/5* reviews make no sense to me.

wish, only, Awesome my only wish is that this game gets developed in 3d format like pubg u and similar to zombie Survival it would be more than ever awesome but the developer won't listen 游땍.

planet, first, Looking for Star Craft for an Android phones? U have it - Iron Marines! Just give it a try. But do not rush Urselves in emotions before U complete 1 act (first planet). After the first act U'll love the game! I'm sure 'bout that! Recommended! 4 out of 5 stars ('cause some bugs). P.s. But I see U still fixing them *bugs

way, sensible, I live the game. Gameplay, Graphics, storyline, difficulty all very well programmed. Suggestions to developer, Please invent a game like age of empires or clash of clans. You can build it in much more sensible way than what is currently available on playstore and with the graphics like this. People will go crazy on that game.
fun, much, YES FINALLY IT DOWNLOADED I'm gonna have so much fun and also here have a rate a 5 stars and also it's ok can you make multiplayer in this game please it looks like multiplayer please make multiplayer.

glance, First, First glance, Iron Marines gave the impression of a simple Kingdom Rush DLC or reskin. But this game is rather different from Kingdom Rush, in that you not only have the option to move your forces freely, but you also passively gather resources to give more needed flexibility on the battlefield as far as funds go, which I particularly enjoy. The only thing keeping me from giving this a five-star rating is that there doesn't seem to be an endless wave game mode; at least none that I'm aware of.

feel, same, I absolutely love this game. It has the same Ironhide feel, but different than the TD of Kingdom Rush. Some people say it is too hard, some say it is too easy, but it is perfectly balanced. It's called strategy. If it's too easy, up the difficulty. One thing that I feel is REQUIRED to make this game 5 stars is an encyclopedia like in the Kingdom Rush games. The enemies are unique and interesting, but it is hard to figure out how to fight them if I can't check an encyclopedia when I need it.

strategy, mobile, A pretty good mobile strategy game with loads of upgrades but it suffers from the same problem as other Ironhide games, unbalanced bosses at the end of some levels which force you to use a specific strategy. It's very frustrating having to replay a level repeatedly just to try a new strategy on the end boss. A simple checkpoint system or more information on the upcoming boss would solve this.

space, favorite, Buy the plane, win the game. This is some of my favorite space sci-fi since starship troopers and starcraft. With the exception of a few overtuned bosses (the tyrant) the game's difficulty is very entertaining. You'll fight hard for every inch and it's a wonderful little world. I wish there was more content. Maybe some choke point survival.

game, bad, It's not a bad game, in the same vein as the others but instead of parodying tropes like fantasy and pirates iron marines seems to have simply used the entirety of StarCraft for most of its inspiration. There is also a bigger sin here where 3/4 of the heroes are behind a paywall. I already paid for your game. I refuse to pay 2-3x more for different ways to describe "move here and attack."

game, Good, Good relaxing game that doesn't involve too much thinking. I like that even when you lose you still gain a little ground with research, etc so basically it gets a little easier each try.

world, second, I have spent $7 toatal on this game and the gameplay is amazing. However i will not tolerate being LIED TO! UPDATE: ------------------------- I accused them of lying for the tech tree perk "research treaty" not functioning as described but once i made it to the second world i woukd receive tech points even when completing old mission.. however sense research treaty states "10% more tech points upon completing ANY mission" but not on the first world, for old missions.

thieving, Dishonest, Very bad. Dishonest, greedy, thieving. Blatant pay to play, pay to "win". Strangely I don't feel any sense of accomplishment from pumping in money to be told I win. No room for skill, strategy, nothing but pay. Uninstalling.

fun, Great, Great fun, just complicated enough to keep you playing, but not so complicated it becomes too hard to play on a mobile platform. I don't understand all the comments about micro transactions and "greed." Currently working through on the hardest difficulty and have not spent more money than the initial price of like $3. They give you access to 3 heros with the initial purchase. You can by 10 or so more for $15, not sure what the problem is. Stop whining, developing games isn't cheap!

mode, endless, I really love this game. It reminded me of a game called Halo Wars. I wish the creators would added Multiplayer mode and endless mode, but other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Please add different type of modes such as Multiplayer (Co-Op and Versus mode) and Endless mode (Team and Solo). Whenever you do add these type of gamemodes please make sure it can be played with local wifi and other people around the world also. I'll give it a full perfect 5 star ratings either ways tho thxss

bucks, few, Enjoyed this game as a way to kill time. Definitely worth the few bucks. Yeah some of the extra heros cost a bit, but you don't need them to play or enjoy the game. Would recommend.

levels, first, the first few levels are kinda fun but around the fourth level it takes a sharp increase in the amount of enemies spawning making it impossible not to get swarmed instantly, no matter what I do I can't seem to get past it.

game, short, Freakin love this game. However, I do have two complaints. (1) There should be an option to buy all heroes, not only individually. (2) only 3 planets makes it a short game realistically. Increasing difficulty doesn't make it longer, content does.

units, multiple, I'm a little concerned about the depth of this game along with the ease of use in dealing with multiple units. Having said that, this could be (FINALLY) the C&C heir apparent for mobile! There is a lot to love about this game, I even love the music. I normally turn off music & sfx 1st thing in games but not this one. There's too much to mention about what I like & even more about suggestions but TRY IT if you like RTS! Love to see multiple unit groups & unit specific commands like guard & such!

devices, mobile, An awesome RTS made for mobile devices!
style, more, I prefer a more sandbox style RTS where you can build wherever you'd like but this game makes up for that by being a solid RTS on a mobile device. Kudos to ironhide for never disappointing and trying their hand at what seems to be a dead but great genre.

game, far, Just a couple levels in. So far game is excellent. Quite challenging. I have played all the Ironhide tower defense games and passed them all without spending money. They are more challenging and rewarding that way. This game seems like it will be passable as well without spending money. Excellent games all of them. Respect for adding the 'never' option to the 'rate game' prompt.

game, Great, Great game! Playing it over again from the start. When are you creating iron marines part 2?
enemys, tough, This game is pretty amazing but level 6 gets to unfair and impossible for me, why meteor shower? And also why does a bunch of tough enemys appear when you find the counciler on level 6? Can you make level 6 easier please?

reason, only, I need more of this! This game is insanely awesome! It's not very simple and will crush you at times and cause you to regroup and reassess. The only reason why I took a star off is because you must pay for other heroes. I've already paid for the game, why not have additional challenges to collect points to use to unlock other characters? It would make the game more challenging and longer lasting.

game, Great, Playing this on the tab s7plus with the s pen is amazing. It's meant for this kind of game. If your a fan of Z Soldiers or Scarcraft you will love this. Great game.
games, many, Not many RTS games on mobile. This one is pretty decent in context. To use RTS terminology, it leans much more in the direction of micro than macro. Lot of fun to be had, but unfortunately most learning comes from trial & error. Enjoyable, well differentiated characters. Rapid switching of unit types is an interesting, new mechanic. Compelling skill-tree. Beginning of the game is rough on hardest difficulty, and the last third of the game is a bit of a slog.

game, best, Still best game but it is lame that there has been no updates or new maps or game modes. Too good a game to just forget about. Game mode infinite waves or defend the base would be a awesome.
