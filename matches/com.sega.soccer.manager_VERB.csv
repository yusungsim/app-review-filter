Played, for, mins, Just brought the game nearly 10 quid. Played it for about 30 mins (after it not working for a while) and in my opinion it feels like it takes an age just to play 3/4 games, some games no matter what tactics, formations, players you use you just lose. There are better free games on the market in my opinion

play, at, pc, Enjoyable since I play FM 2003 at pc. Thanks

looking, to, it, The game is so buggy. I was looking forward to it so much. Buy it every year. My B teams stats aren't moving. Like at all. So as a compromise I put all of the players up for loan. No takers 2 transfer windows now. Not one player. Tried offering to affiliates (all players reject) and teams. Nothing. Tried allocating coaches to put players out on loan. Nothing. So if I want a players stats to increase, I have to put them straight into the first team and play them. So the game is unplayable for me.

s, in, terms, Getting refunded, it's probably worth a try. Theres a whole disconnect between google play and developers in terms of where you go for a refund. Game was bugged but have seen other people play and say its good.

play, in, screen, Doesn't play in full screen and I am on a mobile, so I haven't had the patience to try in detail hence the 3 stars. Very disappointed as I have absolutely loved all of the previous mobile games as a time killer.

seems, For, me, I have been a fan of Football Manager for a couple of decades. Sadly this isn't one of the good ones. Some nice touches and improvements to the scouting. For me it seems virtually impossible to sell squad players to free up cash and revamp the team. Which means you miss out on the buzz of finding exciting new players. I have tried three different teams and no one is buying the players. I would also like to see an unlockable for reinstating the away goals rule.

fill, in, clubs, A lot of small changes from fm21 that really improves the quality of life of the game. Scouting is refined and cleaner, player search has adjustable age ranges and game AI make more transfers and fill holes in the clubs
started, to, crash, I'm into my 2nd season, and the game has just started to hard crash at half time of my next fixture. Just kicks me out of the game, not sure if this is a bug?

ask, for, refund, Kinda difficult to use, first year getting this game and I have not enjoyed it. I did ask for a refund from Google play but I was too late :(
crashing, during, matches, The game itself is great, when it's not crashing during matches that is. It's so annoying to play a load of matches, only for the game to crash or freeze and have to go back and play all those matches again!!! I won't be playing anymore if these problems aren't sorted out ASAP
have, with, photos, i like the game but not enough of the players photos as i like to have players on my squad with photos. i wont pick players without thev photo.

Going, from, screen, Since I updated to android 12 yesterday my game has been very laggy. Going from screen to screen takes twice as long, matches are stuttering and I've just had the half time jump to full time and then crash, which I've noticed other reviews saying. Game was working fine up until yesterday. Side note, please add skins as the constant dark mode feel of this game really strains my eyes.

have, due, job, Good game, but due to my job I often have to do one game at a time, save, and come back to it, but often times the game just decides to not save where you left it and you'll roll back to the previous game. Devs need to look into this.

goes, to, time, It's fun and all but recently the game goes to full time after half time and nothing saves. You either have to start from your last save or the auto saved data. It undo everything you've done till then.

get, for, players, Amazing game as always, the only two bugs i have found so far is that you can't clear your scout history and you never get a sell on fee for players you sell, even though you set a future sell on fee when selling the player. One other thing is that you can't clearly see what competitions you are in at the home screen.
paid, for, game, So I have paid for a game that worked fine for 3 matches. Now it just shuts down half way through the forth match. Can't get past it at all. Waste of money

Seems, after, season, Improve the transfer market a bit. Seems all the players are 100M€ + after a season or two
replying, to, me, Having lots of problems with this I lose every save game have to start a new game everytime I play. I emailed and they just stopped replying to me now my game won't even start and have to clear the history to start it I want a solution to this or my money back
missing, from, game, still missing alotmof details from the main game, but still good
look, at, text, Embarrassing. Everytime I minimize the game to look at a text while I am in a match, the match gets stuck and jumps to full time straight without any options to proceed to next page

like, from, game, Really good addition to the franchise and much smoother and better than fm21. Limited new features but still makes the game fun to play. One thing I would like from the fm21 game is a summary of the competitions you are in on the home screen. It is hard to see what competitions you are still in etc. **edited** direct free kicks are very op, even players in the national North score them to regularly!
load, from, country, As with the previous games, this version is highly addictive, with an excellent level of detail. However, I think FM21 was slightly better. Some suggestions for future updates: 1) Bring back the choice of how many leagues to load from each country. 2) Allow users to return to the game from where they left off if they have to switch apps, rather than having to load the game again even with it running in the background. 3) Contrast the players' positioning colours - it's not clear as it is.

run, towards, area, Can you please finally fix the bug where you keep conceding counter-attacks from attacking corners as all your players just choose to run towards the opponent's penalty area regardless of the instructions? It's been really annoying in 2021 and is still there in 2022 several updates later. Honestly, this year's version feels nothing more than a skin change.
keeps, on, freezing, Game keeps on freezing.
went, into, settings, Enjoyed playing it! Played a few seasons with my chosen club, then got sacked so started a fresh game and now at the start of any season I have no transfer budget, none! So went into settings, deleted all my achievements, uninstalled the game, reinstalled it and still, no matter how many time I start a new game I have zero funds to buy new players.. Crikey! 😱😆
sacked, within, season, Really difficult game this time around. Tried a career with Newcastle 3 times and been sacked within first season all 3 times, despite being mid-table.

valued, at, m, Like every year, the transfer system is broke. Player valued at 30m, the selling club wants 120m. My player valued at 80m, the buying club won't go above 25m. Pathetic how it overly favours the other clubs with every transfer.

using, on, lite, Keep saving games but them when you try and reload them says save mot avaliable... using this on my s10 lite and never had a problem with previous games but this one doesn't like to be saved and reloaded 😡
Playing, on, pixel, Playing this game on Google pixel 3a. The screen resolution looks super weird! Please fix this bug! So disappointing!
get, past, game, Buy it every year! This year tho nothing but problems on my s21 ultra.. constantly freezing and closing can't get past a game and only in my 2nd season. Very disappointed feel like I've just wasted the money
enter, at, phase, I can't even play the game as it won't allow me to enter my name at the setup phase.
go, into, games, Love the app in general. Just like the last few years the menus are simplistic (which is good) and everything else is good. However, often when I go into games, during the 2nd half it will tell me its full time. Whilst showing me highlights of the game!! Meaning I keep having to restart the game

sign, from, teams, I dont understand why are other league players grayed out I can't sign players from teams in Norway,Belgium,Sweden etc please tell me what is the problem
shows, after, game, I love these games and buy new version everytime. This versions seems to have issues however. The home screen shows my reserve team stats for some reason and right after a game it has a summary of the match which is good but states a completely random stadium name. Which all affects the feel of the game and for 8 pound is not very good at all.

exist, with, FMMs, One Step Forward, Three Steps Back The new features are good, however the overall experience has been a hot mess. Performance issues where none used to exist with prior FMMs, a bold, if not harsh, UI color scheme, and my frustrations that the app still can't fill to screen highlight my overall dissatisfactions at this point with the app. As someone who sinks both dollars and hours into this game yearly, it just feels frustrating that this is the current "final state".

create, in, drive, I like the game think it's great and well detailed just a few issues that need sorting 1- The installation. It tells me to create a new file in my save drive which is not needed at all especially when fm21 didn't need it 2- the game save doesn't save when loading into fm always says there isn't a file sometimes it does 3- the game crashes during the save and sometimes kicks me out of my game 4-i always seem to lose all my friendly even as big teams against league 1

resulted, in, goal, Many bugs. I have many players not available in FA cup final. All seems to be on international duties. Also, every VAR calls resulted in no goal. Common, be realistic a bit. There are also bugs running game error but luckily it did not crashed. Out of no where, my manager stats show 2 months with the club when I already almost finish the season.

stuck, on, Dec, Terribly unstable and seem to be in its infancy stage. Gameplay got stuck on 5th Dec 2023 in-game. It will crash and force close, making it unable for me to go beyond that date.

shown, on, list, So many bugs: Players shortlisted aren't shown on my list, transfer fund bonuses for beating bigger teams don't get accumulated directly, occasional failure to launch matches, and worst, so often our strategy doesn't affect the match at all (if you're meant to lose, you'll lose regardless of who or how you play). Lastly, please add some music background or sound effects, it's boring to play in complete silence.

involved, with, that, First it have me options of an in game editor or rich chairman. It wouldn't connect to purchase them. Thought it's probably a good idea not to get involved with that so onto the next page. Couldn't even get the first name and last name. I would click the box, I get the prompt to your my name which I did. Then it still asked me for first name. Also with the second. Cannot get any further now so I've refunded it.

played, in, 2012, Last played FM mobile in 2012 so I was excited to see how the game had developed since then. Turns out it hasn't, if anything it now has even less features than it did back then.
click, on, it, Player stats didn't show until i click on it, scout result doesn't show as their role (youth, first team, and etc.), and a little bit hard to sell player than before, isn't it?

need, for, example, Still need big improve.. for example, when i shortlist player, but no player on the shortlist.. just like fmm21, just few new features.. i think there is a big improve for this fmm22, because i also play for fm touch, but fm touch now only on switch ?!?!?! Very disappointed. Also, the extra time doesn't look clearly, because of the spot (..........) Always, some player are vanish.

fit, into, phone, Everything's great. But the screen doesn't fit perfectly into my phone. pls fix it quickly.
struggling, in, league, I don't really understand this game. It has amazing levels of detail, yet the actual gameplay is remarkably easy. Man United are struggling in the league, yet in the game I'm comfortably first. I barely change the team and haven't altered my tactics once, either before or in game. Yet I win almost every match. Other lack of attention to detail is strange - why do opposing teams put up a one-man wall for corners? Which regularly blocks corner kicks? I have never seen this in real life!

spend, on, transfers, I'm giving this game 1 star atm because I have literally just purchased the game & started my career to find that I have £0 money to spend on transfers for a Premier league team. I don't know if this is a known issue or its supposed to be that way but half of the fun of the game is to buy players & I can't.
stats, in, tab, Still some bugs, Player stats in home tab gives wrong stats Match engine crashes sometimes before match start And still no multi-player mode

came, to, it, Game was fine however came to it today and realized I lost a few weeks of in game date and it won't let me save or even create a new save slot. So basically the game is broken
embarrassed, as, programmer's, You've embarrassed yourself as programmer's...I stayed loyal to your product and instead of getting better it's getting worse...now I can't load the saved game...realese the update, glitch free or I'll never buy your product again...amateurs
paid, after, update, I paid $14 plus sgd for the game, after the recent update, for the game to hang before the menu appear. What is this?! Before the recent update, the game was all along just fine. Now what happen?

Came, in, season, Bugs and too easy. Came 6th in PL season 3 and have no Europa or no Europa Conference football!! Save ruined as I can already see AGAIN it's far too easy, already limiting myself to only buying English players. This is not fun. Started in League 1.

load, because, that, Wont load up any saved games so having to restart a career every time I play the game, because of that I've not had a real chance to try the game
played, for, time, *problem solved* When I played it for the first time everything was ok, no bugs. But since I closed the game and then started it again, the resolution completely changed and I can not do anything to change it, now it s the same every time, bad resolution (Samsung S20 FE)

Losing, for, months, Two major gripes. Firstly, the injuries are just ridiculous. Losing a player for four months due to a training ground injury, and then losing four first team players for at least a month is ridiculous. Secondly, the transfers. If a player is listed at 20 mil, then why does it take 4 times that amount to buy him? Either list a players true price or stop with the insane inflation.

miss, At, end, FED UP OF THIS BROKEN GAME!!! GET IT FIXED!!! Why is it that my defenders just seem to completely disappear, CONSTANTLY leaving attackers alone to score. At the other end, no matter the striker, completely miss the target 90% of the time. No matter what team, tactics, I've tested this, the opposition ALWAYS score in injury time at least once. Tested 8 of the best teams in the world. 8 best goalkeepers in the world and they constantly get 4/5 rating, every game. They score from their 18yd box!

had, before, version, Very similar to FM21 except the game doesn't save properly. Every time I go back on, I have to start again. Waste of my time and money. Either sort it out or refund me. I've had most FM's before this latest version and enjoyed them all.
works, for, company, Feeble bad copy of a real game - going back to last year's Touch. Glad the decision works for the company. Not so glad how easily they screwed their long term fans.
has, in, purchases, What kind of pay to play game then has in app purchases? Where before paying for it did it say this? Seriously that should be illegal.

stop, for, tablets, I'm a fan of FM sfor ages....I really liked FM touch but unfortunately you guys decided to stop for Android tablets. FM mobile is not as detailed as FM touch. Please bring back FM touch for Android tablets.

gone, from, match, Hey, if my opponent is injured, there is this bug that one of my players directly gone from the match.
play, because, error, The game has deleted my season multiple times and now I can't play a match because of an error
give, by, options, Very good game, could have included interview of managers and players Pre n post matches. Can give it by options.
put, for, contribution, I put my tactics for goalkeeper contribution as short but he always makes long passes and I sometimes concede goals from that. This is an issue that has been occurring from different versions of the game and I thought it would have been fixed by now

fit, into, screen, It won't fit into my screen
come, with, review, very ambitious update, and i like what you are trying to do. but the game is much buggier and not ready. when the bugs and glitches are fixed i'll come back with a 5 star review:)
open, after, seconds, Game was going brilliant. Now whenever I open the game after like 10 seconds the game closes down completely. I can now no longer play the game. I want a full refund on this game. Shocking.
Looks, like, game, Looks like a good game but spoiled by a bug which means one of my best players can't improve stats (also the only player I've signed to the team, so that may be something to do with what went wrong). His development bar reached full but it has not been converted into skill points and reset to zero as it does for other players. Still there half a season later. Happy to share more details with the devs if they want to get in touch.

conceding, in, min, Not impressed with the game play, wen 2-0 up at h/t most times u end up drawing 2-2 or losing 3-2 and nearly every game conceding in 90th min, I'm impressed with the work done on transfers, something needs to be done about the greens on player positions as they are too similiar colour, the colours need to be more defined like last year's version

played, about, hour, I only played about less than an hour because I read the reviews an they weren't so good. Here's my two cents: The gameplay was good althought I found some parts laggy and the visuals, my eyes hurt man. I love the idea of the pink/purple contrast maybe you guys could make it a lighter shade. I love the addition of the medical centre and the scouting options overall I think there are a few places that can be improved upon especially visually. I hope it gets better with future updates

improve, past, good, Liked the game initially but now it is get annoying how the board won't improve our training facilities past good even after back to back promotions to English championship. Even though the team reports say that our training facility is sub par and even though we have 10 million pounds in bank. All my half decent players are desperate to leave the club because of this. This doesn't make sense compared to real life as you would think that any club that climbed 4 divisions would have some ambition

choose, in, first, Not good enough yet. Lost the details about the team we choose in the first we played the game. The one with financial status, or stadium capacity, or in what regional championship the team is on..
came, to, issue, It's been a couple of years since I last played fm handheld and I must say I'm impressed with you much it has advanced. However, I'm about a 1/4 the way through my first season and have came to my first major issue. I have a semi-final of a league cup and about 14 of 26 players are away on international duty, meaning I'm having to play the mate with fringe players and fake players as substitutes. I just don't understand how this even happens?

have, on, S21, I am so dissapointed seeing that on a Samsung ultra S21 I have to wait 3 4 minutes for the game to initiate. I have installed the update but the problem persists. @devs, could you please optimize the game? I didn t have any issue with any app/ game from Google Play until this one.
add, like, Moldova, Please Sega can you add more countries trainable especially in Europe like " Moldova , Kazakhstan Iceland , Romania etc.. " and Asian countries " Syria , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Australia , Japan " The experience is very incomplete alot of people would like to train their countries or start with small countries . I will rise my feedback to 5 if any update come out for this. Thanks " Update " i have refund the game it's the best way to show the company that you don't like the way they are behaving

played, since, version, FMM21 downgrade The match engine is terrible. There are no replay, var check, minutes without second, pitch size's smaller Setup corner & freekick is gone. I played FMM since 2019 version and this is the worst
upgrade, from, store, I bought the youth academy upgrade from the store but it disappeared after I quit the game. How can I restore it?
going, after, version, Bring back the touch version, this is going backwards after last year's touch version... I have a galaxy note 20 ultra 5g and the touch version last year was amazing to play on it!!

sign, for, money, I can't sign players for money, I can only get loans or free transfers, even though I have money it is locked???
crashed, whilst, playing, Love the game, but whilst playing, the game crashed and now my SD card is corrupt. Not sure if bad coincidence or a MAJOR problem caused by fm 22
adapt, to, screen, Really poor pixel quality. Will not adapt to screen. Unplayable.
buying, for, years, Hi, I have been buying fm for like 3 years and mever have I had a problem, until now. My saves get deleted every time I exit the game. Please help I really want to play it but for a few days my saves just dissapear the next day...

got, to, cup, Game is great but I have 2 problems: If I minimise or the screen goes to sleep the game crashes when i go back to it (moto g50). Also, i got to the fa cup final (yay me!) but both my and my opponents teams have been decimated by international call ups, cup final is June 1st, 2022 nation cup starts June 3rd
paying, for, game, The game is a good game but I have one issue, I am managing derby county in the efl championship, I drew my 1st match and won my 2nd match but on the league table my team is 24th with a -8points,how possible? It's very annoying to be having issues like this after paying for the game.
listen, for, season, we still have issues of players that don't get approached even when they've been transfer listen for the whole season....that's very frustrating 😤
played, for, year, After reading plenty of reviews good and bad I decided to purchase game as I've played for many year, the game froze on initialising game. Screen is still like this. Should of listened to doubters, game seems to have a few hiccups at the moment

sell, in, game, This is basically FM21 with a new (and worse) color scheme. Also, it's impossible to sell players in this game which is really annoying
depending, on, performance, Always love these games, started a new save and saved it several times only to return later and have no saved game data. Will update and edit review depending on future performance.
sign, into, games, I like the game, and the gameplay. I haven't encountered too many bugs, but one that is really frustrating me is I'm unable to sign into google play games with the game? I was the first time I played now ever since I can't. I've tried reinstalling, clearing the cache of the google play services/games apps and no success. I've also tried to report the issue via the ingame report and the game crashes. But yeah other that I'm enjoying the game.

look, at, center, Game keeps crashing every time I look at the medical center . It bugs out freezes then shuts down. I've replayed the same match 6 times now.
click, On, occasions, This almost feels unfinished. On numerous occasions I'll click to start a match and it says error occurred, try again. On match day, the 'dots' that show you which screen you're on, overlap the added time red box (not a major issue but aesthetically it's annoying) The manager's home page is hard to navigate, if I want to find out about s match, I have to click into fixtures then the match, rather than on the home screen. The league table is also too zoomed in. There's more but no room...

change, to, light, Great game as always but... Is there any way of how to change the main skin of a darker colour to the light one like eg 2017? I'm not fan of dark mode since 2019 when the game was released as a dark mode for the first time, thanks.

Downloaded, onto, chomebook, Downloaded the game onto a chomebook and cant move the screen up or down to pick a team to play with so i randomly picked a side hopi g this wouldnt be the case when i started looking at picking a side but still can not move up or down
Started, as, game, Started off as a relatively good game however despite updating it its still crashing on my Samsung. Not good enough

see, in, 2021, Not much has changed, I was excited to download and see some vast improvements on a well structured game in 2021, hardly anything has changed. Disappointing really.
grow, on, me, I don't like the new home page but it might grow on me. Still 5 stars. Every year you lot manage subtle tweaks that keep it fresh much love ❤
stretched, in, phone, stretched in my phone! while i set off the option, display so tiny! and take very longer to load the start screen! my phone Poco X3. I make refund!
change, during, game, refree wasting time to see the var...useless . i can change my formation immediately during game
have, in, match, It's one of the best manager games but I think it should be free for moblie version as it has less features and other stuffs than the pc version. Or should have more tactical changes as a manager in a match if you guys want to continue as a paid version.

looks, like, throwback, This game is in a relegation battle, no upgrade on FM21 mobile. The colour scheme is horrendous, the display looks like a throwback to the early 2000's and the lag when moving through the screens is borderline infuriating. How can they have got it so wrong? This needs updated, and soon!

change, under, options, Get this game every year, love it. A few bugs I've noticed, can't change chief scout under manager options and theres a bug with Report an Issue, app crashes when I press send report
spammed, After, week, They said they'd fixed the transfer system which lured me in, but it's a load of nonsense. After the first week PSG had already spammed a nonsense under value bid for my top player. It's still impossible to sell anyone for any decent value. And in return the AI still expects 19 trillion dollars for anyone remotely of quality. I could cope with the stupid transfer values if they were fair....but it's not.

loved, since, 2000, Whilst i have been playing Soccer manager 22 (completely free) the matches were in 3d, i expected the same from football manager but on an improved level, i've loved fm since the mid 2000's on pc. The detail on this mobile version is good but without 3d matches i can see myself reverting to soccer manager shortly. Unfortunately regretting this purchase

win, in, day, So I will the league, both domestic cups and the Euro Cup all in an undefeated season... The following season I am 7th in the league after only a month and get sacked.... Another save and I win 2 manager of the year awards in a day and I get sacked 3 days later. I have bought this game every year but this is the last until this is fixed. Also exactly what do you need to win to unlock Place on the Board?

changed, including, scrolling, Enjoying so far but still need to fix the horrible scrolling of team lists etc please create a smooth scrolling experience, so it doesn't just keep jumping back and forth. Played a couple of seasons ago and not too much has changed including the scrolling, overall it continues to be a good franchise just some refinements required.
fixed, over, hours, All you say I update it never admit that you haven't fixed it over 7 hours and £22 down iam still at the start just will not load a game its rubbish 😡

offered, for, players, Game pretty much the same as last year, only difference is the colour scheme that makes your eyes bleed. Still issues with transfers (most of the time teams expect unrealistic prices for players, it seems that any half decent player is min £50million to buy. But at the same time you will be lucky to be offered market value for your own players)
hidden, behind, one, Loving the game so far, as usual. However I have 1 small issue. Stoppage time. If it is showing the pitch, the stoppage clock is hidden behind one of the dots, when not showing the pitch it is fine and has the dots after the clock. Be nice if it was fixed as you really want to see how much stoppage time you have when displaying the pitch

Feels, like, FM21, I don't understand why isn't this a cut price? Feels like FM21.
start, Like, FM21, Update as of 12th Nov. Game is still laggy. Maybe because we cant choose what leagues to concentrate on. Like FM21, we can start choose Championship in England. Ui is not stretchy now though. Dont see a diff frm FM21. Old: Why is the game laggy. Using s20 ultra so my games do not lag except this one! And the UI! Omg. It is stretched until it looks like a downgraded version of fm21 when it's supposed to be an upgraded version. Was so looking forward to fm22 and now i'm very dissappointed!

bought, for, years, Have bought FM Mobile for years and never had an issue until 2022. Game doesn't cover the full screen so it's all small and awkward to press on next button etc. How do you get a refund because it's an absolute waste of money! Just downloaded it today but would not recommend at all! Wouldn't waste your money such a shame

stretching, on, S20, Screen keeps stretching on my S20+ makes it unplayable if I delete the game and reload still does it again?? Looks really good as well
recommend, to, everyone, it's a very good game with amazing details. played last year's game and have to say they've made another great game with new additions. would recommend this game to everyone. it's always a very good price not expensive like most other games
talking, about, limitations, Do something new ffs. Like you keep talking about device limitations. My phone is more powerful than my potato laptop which I use to run the regular fm game. You CAN do better. More tactical options, more positions, more depth. Honestly, what kind processing power do "media features" need? (Interviews, team talks etc). We have a medical centre...and better transfers AI...wheres the added realism, the immersion? NOT EVEN CROWD AND REFEREE SOUNDS FFS. HOW HARD IS IT. I'd defo pay more for these.

feel, like, step, The game doesn't feel like a big step up I requested a refund and still haven't received my money ,it's been 5 days
sink, into, manager, Can sink so many hours into Football manager, and the mobile version is perfect for playing when out and about, my train journeys to work are better for it! Really helpful support team at Sega too. Had an early issue which they got fixed for me really quickly. Thank you!

click, on, features, Not even been able to load the game, as I try to open it it only fills half my screen then it won't allow me to click on any features, waste of 9 quid
starts, with, screen, Always get football manager , every year , this year full of issues , starts with a stretched screen , lost my saved games twice , Can't play the game until this is fixed Will change review when these are fixed
got, in, game, I'm going to play it, and probably a lot. But please make it harder. Even in the last game I got to the point of having 600m to spend, and 8m under wage budget and going unbeaten for 130 games with Portsmouth. Also, change the pink. Just change it, it's awful. No new major features to note. Phone screens are more like tablets now anyway, so why not have the touch version at least available for mobiles. Alternatively, just make this version a little more like that, with more detail, and tactics.

start, with, club, Can't buy anything I wanted to buy the coaching badge it has taken my money but as said it can't complete the transaction. I play this game every year and I love it.

However if this continues I may not bother as I don't want to start with no club and have to join a club I don't want to it is pointless

navigate, around, game, excellent first impressions of the game, just played first season and easy to navigate around the game.
build, because, that, Really not what I expected. Why do some players disappear depending on what nation's you select at the start. Unable to build the squad you want because of that. Transfer values are so unrealistic when trying to make offers. Clubs wanting £100 million plus for average or unproven players at the very start of first seasons. Will keep sticking at it to see if can get into it more.

feels, with, updates, Gameplay laggier and slower than usual, looks blurry and not as clean, the UI is awful, there was no need to change it that much, the gameplay without numbers doesn't feel right either. Game feels aboit 5/6 years old with no updates. Not a fan
get, for, prices, It's okay I just feel like they tried too hard to make it better than last year but now it's a bit more confusing and the play prices are rediculous if you have 40 million that can't even get you ayoze perez but can somehow get you Zaha for half the prices. Also the game hasn't even changed apart from the players and the home screen so it make it a bit boring bc it just feels like fm21 but in a different style of colour. But overall its a alright game but the player prices really let it down!

comes, to, loading, It gd but it is abit slow when it comes to loading
looks, on, stretch, Absolutely terrible, I've spent 10 minutes trying to play one game and the furthest I've gotten without crashing was half time. UI looks terrible on stretch and is too small regularly. Why up the price for this.
playing, since, 2018, Have been playing since 2018.. I think this version have the worst graphic for match.. So many un unusual (weird) movement from player.. One of my defender chasing striker at their own half, then the striker can score from that far. While the other defender still on their position.. Goal keeper run to left corner while therw is attack from right side.. Its super disturbing.. Please fix it..

taken, at, moment, This rating may well change...but at the moment I've taken over a vanarama North side and my squad has between 3 and 5 stars....eh? A 35k player has not just potential but current 5 stars...and 90٪ of my team have 3+....this isn't right is it surely?!?
reopening, after, opening, Screen either becomes really small or really stretched when reopening the game after the initial opening. Unplayable when this happens.
had, for, days, I've had it for less than two days and am already close to giving up. My game has stopped saving, despite trying different/multiple slots, so I keep losing progress. Much as I'd like to, I can't keep the game running 24/7 to negate this issue. Expected better quite frankly
played, for, while, Very disappointed, not played the mobile version for a while as I was able to get the touch version on my phone, now there's no touch version I have to pay this version and it hasn't changed since I last played, in fact it's worse. You can't instruct the players via touchline shouts, it looks like a game for people with poor vision with how big everything is. Nowhere near enough detail in the game to warrant the price. Bring back the touch version!!!

initialising, for, mins, Love football manager but had to refund this, game just wouldn't start, stuck on initialising new game for 15 mins with no progress bar, same thing happened loading a saviour challenge with one league selected.

played, to, date, Great game and a bargain for 8.99 and considering it's mobile, it's one of the best mobile games I've played up to date, UI is a bit too bright, there are a few small bugs and players do consistently get injured but other than that, amazing game, please buy it and don't base it off the reviews because the reviewers are mainly haters for some reason

gone, from, HD, Absolute shambles! Slow, keeps randomly crashing, saved game wouldn't load, auto save caused it to crash, switched phone off & on and save has now disappeared completely! Player search menu change was unnecessary. Keep closing the search instead of resetting it! Quality has randomly gone from HD to potato! Paid for the game, unlockables bundle and to purchase a tutor for a coach and now that save is gone and the other things I've bought are useless. Get this sorted ASAP or you owe me money...

fix, as, screen, Downloaded and closed after playing now the screen has went funny 2nd time i loaded please fix as screen is stretched and not HD no more
stretched, to, screen, Decent game as usual. Display isn't great as stretched to screen and loses resolution.
coming, for, mins, Game itself is so fun but have to reinstall after coming out of the game for longer than 10 mins as the screen is strechted and the quality goes from crisp hd to early 2000s television PLEASE FIX!! but the game itself is better than last years imo so highly recommend! (Also cant report the issue through game as it crashes)

fix, with, resolution, Knew there would be some bugs, but can you fix the issue with the screen resolution immediately? Can barely see the game
stretched, across, phone, Shocking game. Either it is stretched across my phone or its a little box in the middle of my screen. When it does actually work or load and work properly the transfer market is shocking even average players have a asking price of 3x there value. Please sort this all out asap or the app will be deleted and I'll be looking for a refund

get, after, 5mins, Ok. So, this is just a FM21 Mobile clone with an added "injury center". No other (obvious) changes to the core game. The color scheme is way to bright. I get a headache after 5mins. Hot pink on black is bad. This is known. The match engine seems... wrong. I'm seeing opponents score 3-4 times more then they normally would. And scoring frequently from the middle of the pitch. Which is weird, because everything else feels the same as 21. I think it needs more polishing. I'll refund for now.

played, with, characters, Not worth the buy, it looks like a kid played with characters and created their computer generated faces on some AI players. Was funner the 2021 version.

work, on, screen, The game downloaded well, & I set up my first save ok, but now the 'restore' save button doesn't work on the start screen. I cannot access my saved game, so no good at All. I'm sure over the coming days & weeks the issues & bugs will all be ironed out, but until then, I'll stick with SM Worlds. Only 1 star obviously, Impossible to review a game that I can't play, but will re-review when I can play.

used, of, color, There are still pretty bad UI decisions. Not only of a toxic pink color (you can get used to it), but the scaling is broken on Day 2, also the added minutes sign is covered by the first dot from menu. Also, it is not allowed to demote players to the reserves, though the squad grows big with players nobody wants even to loan. I guess, is a historical issue, and was introduced before

filling, in, HD, Interface seems to have got worse over the years, screen visual not great with it being stretched rather than filling correctly in HD, no imaging rights for a number of top clubs and players.
fit, with, scaling, It's completely unplayable on an S21 Ultra, as it is stretched to fit the screen with no scaling at all. If you turn the stretch feature off it is a tiny window in the middle of the screen.
hurts, with, screen, Disappointing lack of improvements to FM21. The bright pink colour hurts the eyes even with dimmed screen. Common snags from FM21 haven't been resolved - e.g. all goals from corner kicks described on commentary as being from counter attacks. Player abilities quite lazily generally seem to be the same as FM21 despite certain players clearly being much better/worse.

Crashed, after, season, Crashed after the first season. Won the league and now its not loading at all
Worked, for, hours, Unplayable due to UI! Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing as it was this is a common issue but the screen in stretched and it doesn't work properly now. Worked fine for a few hours but now unplayable. Really not happy about this, releasing a bug ridden game, charging more every year I can handle, but charging 8.99 for a game that literally can't be played after a few hours is daylight robbery! Please fix this asap or give a refund for purchase as this is unacceptable.

stretched, with, proportion, Resolution problem is hard to deal with. All screen is stretched with no proportion. If disabling this option in settings, the game takes just 1/3 of the place. This have to fix very soon! Samsung s20, Android 11. Otherwise the game is awesome!
place, in, team, Worse than FMM2021, I wish I could refund this unfinished, abandoned, buggy game, and probably won't be fixed anytime soon. 1. Screen resolution automatically change once I re-enter the game and there is no option menu to change it back to normal 2. There is no major change to in-game editor (can't place coach in any team, no manager search, can't add players in the game) yet they charge for a lot of money 3. Why don't they add the easier feature to increase/decrease the salary by 1000 or 10000

releasing, on, mobile, I still played FM2020 touch and have to say that on mobile it was good. Not sure why they aren't releasing it on mobile this year . As I instantly regretted buying this after 15 mins . The in match options are so poor can't seem to give instructions on how you play against other teams during play . The in game display seems like you let your kids lose with the crayons.... big step backwards TBH . I hope a touch version becomes available for mobile devices until then I'll stick with the 2020 one

bought, on, android, Terribly unstable. First launch was ok. Subsequent launch the app crashed and the resolution became grainy and the screen aspect became distorted. 3rd launch i lost all my saved games. I have religiously bought every FM on android for last few years. This is by far the worst i have encountered.

Goes, from, HD, My screen Goes from HD to nicely fitting on my screen, to really stretched and looking awful! I've had to uninstall and reinstall just to get it back to normal. Love Football manager but just looks a bit lazy! Same as 21!

check, on, this, I have the same problem with most of the people who gave Reviews. Display is great once installed but once you close and open it again. It becomes zoomed in and affects display quality and interface. Please check on this. I am using a Samsung Galaxy s20 FE. And just an addition, I played the previous gamr FMM21 on this same device without any problems.

zoomed, to, much, Everytime I go to play the game the screen is stretched and zoomed in to much I play about with the settings and it does go back to normal but if I stop playing and then come back later to play its stretched out again which is pretty annoying to be honest

done, for, years, I always get this game and have done for many years. As previous reviews do state on here, there is a couple of little improvements that could be made. The 2nd time the game is open the stretch mode is the only way to get a full screen but it is what the mode suggests, its stretched and not very pleasant at all and an update to fix this would be ideal. The colours to see the players positional strengths need an improvement, its not as clear as previous games which is disappointing too.
crashing, on, Samsung, The games keeps on crashing on my Samsung note 20..
playing, on, mode, Love the new game, really enjoy playing it however multiple times I have opened it, it is really stretched out and no longer HD. I am playing on enhanced mode, on a Samsung S21 Ultra 5G makes it disappointing

have, As, comparison, Crashed so often and can't relogin :( very annoying. I will change this review if there is any software update. As comparison, I also have fm2021 and it's work.
Playing, for, days, Playing for past two days. I recently had FM 2020. So here's the review. - Game simulation is just pathetic. Random players move to random areas and suddenly it's a goal! Real disappointment. - Game simulator suddenly gets frozen for no reason. My phone's other features are working normally, so an issue with the game and not the phone. - UI color scheme is too saturated. Really not pleasant to eyes for long hours. Thus the two stars reduced otherwise a good game overall.
move, to, areas, Playing for past two days. I recently had FM 2020. So here's the review. - Game simulation is just pathetic. Random players move to random areas and suddenly it's a goal! Real disappointment. - Game simulator suddenly gets frozen for no reason. My phone's other features are working normally, so an issue with the game and not the phone. - UI color scheme is too saturated. Really not pleasant to eyes for long hours. Thus the two stars reduced otherwise a good game overall.
load, onto, menu, Paid £8.99 for it to load onto the main menu and repeatedly crash. Sort it out.
displayed, in, box, Galaxy S20, game displayed in tiny box in the middle of the screen. Not even worth playing until this is sorted. Back to FM21 for now.

Works, like, charm, Works like a charm
crashed, by, game, So many bugs and every game I've created (3) has crashed by atleast the 2nd game of each season and corrupted, so each save deleted and wasted everything I did each time. Seems a total waste of money and very much like 21... havent noticed any difference.
relook, at, that, Feel conned into making this purchase since we were told the happy medium for tablets would be via xbox gamepass. However that version is unplayable on tablet given half the controls require controller and their answer is to enable onscreen controller? It's not the same. I hope they relook at that. I'm speaking from ignorance but I am unsure why we couldn't have just paid for an updated roster patch for fm touch 21? Instead were relegated to old skool fm even though prior versions were better?

Based, on, comments, Yesterday this game was perfect. However, today there has been some update that stretched the overall screen and made the game unplayable. Based on the comments it does not appear that I am alone with this complaint. Please update the game and I'll adjust my rating up to 5 stars. Thank you!
looking, to, this, brilliant been looking forward to this for so long !!
increasing, to, screen, Please team FM is there a solution of increasing the display to full screen? I am using a Samsung A22 and I am not getting full screen display rather a center cut display? Can it be fixed? The app is not just functioning. I don't know if it's because of the resolution size or whether it is not compatible with Samsung A22. I can't even access the home menu. It's a java game on an android.
see, on, PlayStation, I love the new football manager 2022 and I play football manager 2021 and I would like to see it on the PlayStation 5
get, on, screen, Game experience is fine but when I try to start it again, it won't load, I just get a little square on the screen. On a Samsung G21 Ultra. Any fixes.
Worked, on, play, Worked fine on first play, went back to load my save again and now the screen is stretched and no way of seemingly getting it back to normal. Also doesn't seem to be a way of changing the skin and the pink is too bright for my liking
played, for, hours, Will review my review once they sort the stretch bug, played it for a few hours no issues then all of a sudden the picture is stretched and won't go back
Fix, for, game, Fix the screen stretching, for such a established game which i was excited for it to come out, its really disappointing
opened, on, mobile, 1st time I opened game no issues on my mobile, 2nd time opening the screen is stretched horribley and no way of fixing it via the options. 2ndly they still haven't fixed the player offer system on mobile, players still over priced in almost every case. The skin is awful also

went, on, it, Screen is stretched. It worked fine when installed but then the next time I went on it is pixilated - have tried to untick stretch screen but this just makes it go very small. Please sort the bug! Great game though
streached, on, s21, Screen is streached and small on my samsung s21 it needs sorting, I am very disappointed.

fit, to, screen, Doesn't fit to screen! Why can't it fit properly? Last years was fine
wanted, over, game, I hate the pink all over the skin, absolutely hate it! Fine for my daughter, but not for a grown man! If I wanted vivid pink all over my favourite game I'd be playing LOL Surprise and not a football game. Not even an option to tone it down or change it..... so far..... but hopefully Sega come to their senses before I request a refund and move over to a football manager game that looks like a football manager game and not an attempt to draw in female customers

bought, for, time, Dear developer. I bought every version of this game for a long time, I'm a big fan of FM since 2005! And always disappointed in FM Mobile. Why don't support the new screen ratio!? It's 2 years ago that I asked for this! The developer told me the new mobile screen ratio was hard to fix for support and I understand it. But after 2 years your game still does not support the new mobile screen ratio!? Really? Why does iPhone's new screen ratio has support but for Andriod phone doesn't? From a big fan of your game...till now.

live, to, mark, I still would rather play FM 2020, 2021 didn't live up to the mark and I was really hoping 2022 would but this one bites the dust as well. I mean it's gone a long way trying to make the mobile version just like the pc version, which at least I personally did not sign up for. Selling players has just detoriated since FM 2020, in both FM 2021 & 2022 its near impossible to sell your players for even a low price, but you must overpay for even the weakest of players. Not a big fan of the layout too.

played, for, years, Have played Football Manager for years. I wish I hadn't bought this years version. On FM22 Mobile I played for a while then saved the game. When I tried to go back in the saved game was not there and I had to start all over again. Tried a few times and same problem!

play, in, state, At first it was fine but then got the stretched screen like everyone else(Samsung S21) Fun game but I'm not going to play it in this state.
opens, with, screen, Every time the game closes and I then open the game later to play, it opens with a horrible stretched screen (including players faces). To fix this issue, I need to reboot the phone. If it is not fixed, I think I'll request a refund.
takes, to, hour, When I add player faces, logos and kits the game takes up to an hour to load. And can't choose a specific league I want to load in a country, it literally selects all division in that country and it makes the game slow.

work, on, Ultra, Awful. Absolute rubbish. This is the only game I ever buy every year. Wish I hadn't bothered this year Game absolutely doesn't work on the Galaxy Note Ultra. Screen is awful stretched and unreadable in some places. Crashes every two to three games. Sometimes games end but you cant progress meaning a restart is needed and the game needs playing again. Awful, dreadful. DO NOT BUY IT!!

stuck, on, screen, More than willing to change my review as I get Football Manager every year and every year I love it and literally get hundreds of hours out of it. This is the first time I've ever had problems, once I select which nations I want to play in, it's just stuck in "Initializing Game" and just doesn't progress, was stuck on that screen for about 20 minutes. Really gutted as I was really looking forward to this edition and the new features, hopefully this can get resolved.

crashed, at, save, Regretted buying it. Display is off. Game crashed at first save. User interface is not user friendly. Colour scheme is way too bright. Once restarted, game display is stretched.
gone, after, restart, Saved game gone after restart!!!
fix, on, device, After buy the game can't open play when I'm click play it's always crash out the game. Please fix on OnePlus device
look, like, it, The screen stretch is awful and makes it look like it from the 1990s! Was good to begin with but now won't display properly

have, after, load, I have problem with the screen resolution after the 2nd load of the game. The screen is stretched and is now difficult to change the tactics of the team. Please fix this bug. My device is Samsung Galaxy S10+.
stretch, via, interface, This is the first time in over 6/7 games I can say that the game is not worth the money. I would normally buy the in game pack too but not this time. The natural screen is tiny and when you then click to stretch it via user interface it looks horrible. Previous games didn't have this issue so why change it? To be honest it actually spoils what could have been a really good game. The developers should be ashamed of FM22MOBILE its an absolute disgrace a company so experienced in making this game.
paid, for, game, Terrible on my phone. Barely compatible galaxy s20. Just paid for the game and it's completely unplayable. Cannot make anything out. Terrible.
stretched, on, time, Good game with some nice little additions. Only problem on Samsung s20 is the game has stretched on the 2nd time of opening and now graphics and font quality are pretty poor. Please resolve asap
work, on, tab, Doesn't work on Samsung tab 6. Refund and back to touch 21 it is. Very poor I'm disappointed as I was looking forward to this as you won't give us a touch version this year.

win, with, squad, The game itself is playable but the injury centre feature is a bit tedious. Players seem to get injured all the time. I can't seem to win a game at all even with a decent squad against weaker opposition. It'd be great if you could become under 21s international manager.

noticed, in, game, First off, kudos to the devs to fix the bugs so quickly so massive applause to you guys. Second, once again, your team has delivered quality. Absolutely awesome guys. Love playing it. A few niggles here and there. One, the UI colour scheme has to change, its way too bright. The previous versions had a better UI color scheme. Also, i noticed in my game, the player faces wont show, even for the Barcelona team(which im managing atm) so please look into that. Otherwise, another golden egg from you.

gets, to, game, Paid and downloaded it as soon as I woke up excited to play the new version and it gets to the initialising new game not and freezes so I can't actually play it
stretching, after, times, Display getting stretching after few times. Need to fix this issue
continue, for, normal, I'm really impressed with the game this year. New features are really good. Overall gameplay experience is faster than before. All good. Keep up the good work. The only thing I would suggest is that please change the pink colour to show only when the response is really needed and not for the normal continue button because its not good for the eyes. Other than that, its a brilliant game again.
set, than, year, Good game much better set out than last year only thing is its hard to sell players even youth players when you offer them to club says no club is interested due to wage being so high sort It out please

play, than, this, FM touch is much better than this. Would rather play FM touch 21 than this. FM should've discontinued this and stuck with touch. Waste of money i only lasted 5mins before turning it off.

optimised, for, Fold, Loving the game so far, appreciate the new features added! It'd be great if the display be optimised for the Z Fold 3, playing the game in stretched mode isn't really pleasing to the eyes.
knocked, out, park, More than impressed with this year's version. The team have knocked it out the park as they do each year... Don't be put of buying and downloading by the reviews that it's not the same as the pc version. Simply put its not a pc optimised game it's not going to be like the pc version. Gameplay is easy to follow and enjoy there's nothing better than knocking your rivals out the cup

Looking, to, release, Looking forward to the release of this edition. Unfortunately, this game crashed after I chose a team to manage. Better fix that up dev team!
buy, on, go, The game isn't bad it doesn't full screen on my phone and it's kinda annoying I'm on the Samsung s20 Fe. The game is basically the same as last year I would like to see more added but oh well. I buy this for on the go and play the PC version when I'm at home. 3 star till game gets fixed cause it's kinda buggy.
compared, to, versions, Tf is wrong with the UI. It su*k hard compared to the previous versions.
work, on, s6, Doesn't work on tab s6. Looks stupid and is NOTHING compared to fmtouch. I'm asking for a refund.
