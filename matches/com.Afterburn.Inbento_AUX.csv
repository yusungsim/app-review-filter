was, game, fun, This, This was a fun little puzzle game, definitely worth the price I paid. I would kind of like a hint system for times when I'm truly stuck but honestly that's not much of a game breaker. Part of the game experience is a bit of challenge. I'd definitely consider buying another puzzle game from this studio

is, experience, enjoyable, which, Cute story, calm but challenging puzzles that progress in a logical order - the game teaches you to play itself implicitly, which is such an enjoyable experience when it's done well. Wish there was more!
is, game, fun, This, This is a really fun puzzle game! The only complaint I have, is that when the puzzles get really difficult, the music can stress me out haha. I need some more calming music in those stressful times üòÅ.
's, experience, perfect, It, I was hesitant to buy this game, since the trailer and pics didn't make it super clear what to expect, but I am so glad I bought it and 100% recommend you go ahead and purchase if you've been on the fence about it. I've already been suggesting it to my friends left and right. It's the perfect puzzle experience. Very mellow, perfectly challenging without ever feeling frustrating, it's got real "let's take a few minutes to avoid thinking about how crappy 2020 has been" vibes.
is, game, excellent, This, This is an excellent game, the artwork is lovely and I'm not surprised by all the other good reviews. Please make a sequel, as this game deserves it. Inbentwo üòÅ
is, game, nice, This, It's sad how impressed I am with a perfectly fine puzzle game on mobile that doesn't manipulate or deceive the player. This is a nice little game to toy with on the bus.

's, difficulty, impossible, it, The art is super cute, and the puzzles are super fresh too! Sometimes, difficulty escalates a bit too much, but it's not flat out impossible difficulty. This game doesn't have hints though, and I think that having slight bit of hints when the player get stuck for too long might be good. Otherwise, the controls are so smooth and responsive, combined with cute arts and I've fallen in love, eagerly waiting for new contents.
is, puzzler, beautiful, this, I really love this game, but I wish there was something to keep you from getting stuck. I've been on 04.09 for a couple weeks, & since the levels are locked & there's no hints, my only option (in order to keep playing) is to cheat. Aside from that qualm, this is a beautiful little puzzler to get lost in :)

is, game, cute, This, This is a really cute game. Puzzles become progressively more difficult but are not impossible to solve.
's, game, fun, It, It's a very fun and relaxing game. Good job!
's, expierence, sweet, It, It's a sweet peaceful little expierence of a puzzler. The simple sounds are great as well as the chilled musical tones. I would honestly reccomend this to any one with 3 dollars to spair
