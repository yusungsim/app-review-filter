message, first, To be honest I grew up with it to and this was from the first message that is on the top same and yes it's kinda hard but fun :)
aswell, good, FnF is better but this is good aswell
level, first, All I can say is.. bad. I love geometry dash, but when I got it on this phone, I opened it and one of the permissions as make and manage phone calls? I don't think that is needed. And, once I tried to play, it wouldn't register my taps, and I KNOW I tapped the screen correctly. Is this because I turned off one permission? What? I'm so confused. I could only get to about 56% of the first level before I stopped to think about this. Robtop, please, do atleast SOMETHING about this! Please!
game, Awesome, Awesome game
experience, fun, Really fun gaming experience, offers a simple way of just tapping your screen/mouse to get through levels that range from the difficulty of Stereo Madness to user levels like Firework and Slaughterhouse. Would recommend for sure if you want a fun relax, the music is really good. If you want to stay motivated to beat harder levels, make jumps but not to big jumps, like Sakupen hell to Kenos (I'm looking at you SpeedyMuffin). There are many great content creators on YouTube and Twitch. Have fun!

game, Great, Great game but other than that the hit boxes are great as well it's a great game no ads and it keeps you occupied for a long time I can't stop playing perfect gamei got a few more ideas tho 1st is a new cube that is much like the space ship but a 2.0 2nd is a cube for the shot I'd say for it about 2000-3000 for it it's high tech and has a glowing trail. That's mostly it for my ideas but good game.i have one more cube its a cube just like the jumping one but you can stay up it the air longer.

stuff, much, This game is so fun, I've played it for now over 5 years and I'm still not bored of it. So much stuff to do. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we've been waiting for 2.2 for over 4 years.
levels, more, This game is really fun, but yall have not updated it in a while, but like the game but just put more levels on it.
looooool, Best, Best 2.2 wen looooool
game, hard, As a person who plays on phone I really like this game as much as it is a hard game it will show you the ropes and it's all about muscle memory
game, fun, Geometry dash is a fun game
display, full, It's not full display for my Poco x3 pro

version, full, I love geometry dash so much but something I don't get is that when you buy the full version of geometry dash you don't get all of the levels can you plz update it so you can have all the levels without collecting coins or if you can use a code to unlock the levels I would rather have deadlocked then finger dash honestly
game, good, It is just a good game
game, good, It's a good game but too much freezing and lagging
version, newer, It's good but the problem is that I don't have the newer version of gd it says I need to update it but I doesn't show in Google play so I was wondering that what's going on
game, incredible, Absolutley incredible game that I can not recommend enough!!! 10/10 for sure!
game, Good, Good game
game, Great, Great game but some of my levels were deleted
game, best, best geometry dash game ever made so far, he rest are ok to but I say this ones a 10/10 the secrets are just amazing too-
days, few, I liked the game, but it got bored after a few days and I don't like it anymore. How do I get refund
game, great, This is a great game which I played all the time around 4 years ago. I decided to try playing it again so I bought the game. I wouldn't ask for much and just want to play it normally, but the game doesn't even fit the screen of my Samsung S10. This made me resort to using full screen settings from the settings app which just makes the game FPS lag so much. Disappointing that the developers can't even do a bug/quality of life update.

bug, giant, I love this but... Well there is a giant bug that removed almost all of my levels I made and I am super upset about it. It happened when I installed after not playing for a long time. I was already logged in so I refreshed my save and went to my levels and all my hard work was gone. Was nearly reduced to tears. However, this doesn't seem to happen when you play often so no worries there... Anyway great game, I love it, ROBTOP GIVE US 2.2 AND ILL GIVE 5 STARS, FIX THE BUG AND ILL GIVE 4!

songs, recent, I love this game, especially seeing as I kinda grew up with it. However, I think there may be some sorta glitch or bug or somethin', cuz I can't seem to use some of the more recent newgrounds songs (by smaller artists, I mean). Like, I've been trying to make a level using a song from a creator I like (check out korewakosu you'll love it 😘) but it seemed to just cut off the last digit when I put in the ID for the song. Other than that, 5 outta 5 would recommend!

I went to steam support, but it wasn't much help. So now I'm here, it hasn't been working for 3 days. Did something happen to my account?

level, main, It took me 4 years but I finally beat every main Robtop level and waiting on 2.2 like everyone else. The only reason why I'm not rating 5 stars is because of update scarcity. Robtop should just use the beta feature on Steam and Android if an update isn't out yet. Minecraft does it. This way we won't have to wait years for an update.

It only does it on the first attempt so not much trouble there, but I just wanted to say something. Anyway, super fun game!! I hope they update again!!

demons, easy, Pretty much all my stuff is gone. I re-installed this on another device but like 1/5th of my stuff is gone and all my demons are gone. It's not that i havent saved because i have messages on that game from when i had 8 demons. I litterslly said pretty much this: "im 8 demons in and can't find any more easy demons that're actually easy". And i have apparently 0 demons. So if that messagr saved from when i had 8 demons it clearly shows at least that much has saved but still i have no demons
depression, conical, I like this game the music is great some levels are amazing like bloodlust firework and kenos but this game has problems 1 the updates take to long 2.2 is out now but it nearly took 4 years 2 some levels are good and then there's conical depression it's an ugly level with very out dated decoration and not that fun gameplay 3 if you play on mobile some levels like the yandere are laggy as hell sure there's a low detail mode but still it kinda sucks this game is good but it as flaws I like it 🙂👍

years, little, I really like this game and have playing for a little over 4 years now. I was reading some of the reviews, and seeing a lot of people saying they signed into their account on a new device or after deleting the app and losing all the progress. If you do that, after you sign back into your account you need to load your data back onto the device otherwise you won't have any progress.

downsides, Main, I've been playing this game for 5 years now. Majority of it on mobile, now on PC (Steam). I find myself always coming back to it and I can never seem to get bored. Main downsides is that updates take a while, and that syncing account data is notoriously buggy (However there is almost always a way to do it), but we all love RobTop and know he is trying his best. A great game to test patience, reaction time, memory, and even train your brain to keep up with fast paced gameplay in most levels.

game, fun, Its a fun, simple, yet challenging game that you can learn and get better at. You never run out of content because ugl (user generated levels). There's one problem that I have. When I deleted the game on accident and I logged into my account after I downloaded it again, and I lost my progress and all my icons, All that stuff. I do still think it's a five star but I wish that was fixed. Good game that I recommend you try.

version, full, I've been playing Geometry Dash lite lately and have been really enjoying myself, so I went ahead and bought the full version. This was probably one of the best purchases I've made on the play store. Definitely recommend to anybody who thinks they enjoy GD lite a bit, it opens up a whole lot more content.

tablet, old, This game is great, but there's a glitch, I played this on my old tablet a while ago, and made a really good level, I have a new tablet, but now, I want to move my old levels and the way I tried (making an account and signed in on both tablets, then merging the data, the sync failed). I can't even access the old levels on the old tablet, Is there any other way to move levels, and are the old levels just plain GONE??? (If this problem is resolved, I will change this review, and rate five stars).

games, other, Robtop with all the other games you made I'm really hope you make another geometry dash game with all your five games well I don't know if you have really have five games like maybe you only have four and probably just pretending on YouTube so if I got that wrong I'll try to get it right if you're interested then I'll try to find out okay I don't have the table and if we have it it's just faking you you're probably just dummies I did not say that to you I'm just trying to make sure okay

game, Amazing, Amazing game. The levels are very fun and challenging. I never lose any progress or icons. There are not that many ads, which is good because games like this would probably have tons of ads. I recommend this game if you like challenges. 100% worth the money. Edit: well, where do I even start? Well, a little bit earlier I got into my account and wanted to play. Right when I got on, I noticed that...all my progress was gone!! My icons, progress, and everything were gone! Went to 5 star to 1 star.

lags, bad, This game is really bad lags to much
mucho, gustó, Excelente juego. Me gustó mucho. Ya practicamente me pasé todo el Geometry Dash Lite, lo unico que puede hacer que Las personas lo desinstalen es que puede estresarte. Pero de resto es muy chevere ver como avanzas poco a poco, viendo como mejoras cada ves que avanzas cada nivel. La verdad lo recomiendo mucho, solo tengan calma puede llegar a estresarlos al punto de enojarlos y no divertirse solo hay que disfrutar y saber perder. Y si hay que pagar para las demas opciones.

challenges, good, This game and nice and all, music is good , good challenges but when there is a level that requires the wave icon like blast processing or geometrical dominator and when i press once, it will go up then down which causes me to fail, i thought one click it would go up and another click would go down, i have to give it 3 stars instead of 5

music, addictive, This game is really great, it has addictive music and gameplay that will never run out. You will never truly finish the game because there are millions of user created levels which you can also create and play. If your looking for a hard game, this is the one. But at the same time it can be easy as you get better or just play easier levels. The game runs smoothly and has (from my perspective) no bugs. You can create your own custom character with unlockable colors, icons and other veichles.

glitch, tiny, I spent over 24 hours straight on a level just for a tiny little glitch to make it impossible to go back and play the level or edit it, it is extremely frustrating for something you worked so hard on just to be taken away for a glitch and that same glitch also affected a lot more of my creations and my favorite part of gd is the level editor and I don't even wanna look or think about because of this extremely devastating glitch and there are 100+ more glitches and I'm not exaggerating

game, big, I really enjoy Geometry dash because it is a not super big game and it's free, also it's a really great test of skill, determination, patience and memory. So that's why I give it a 5 star review

years, several, I have played for several years and can say without a doubt this is one of my favorite games ever, it is more a mental game than a game of skill, do you rage and lose consistency? Or do you keep calm and beat the level? Its the kind of gameplay I really like. (Also the music is a jam)

game, fun, Geometry Dash is an incredibly fun game. The community levels are some of the most fun and cool-looking, though you can still have fun with the default levels. It saddens me that the game hasn't received a single update since 2017. There's an issue where on my new Samsung phone, on a level's first attempt in a session, it will momentarily go at 2x speed which gets annoying. I'd really like to see bugs fixed and new features released.

creators, non, I've played this since 2017 and it's amazing, but I wish moderators would look at non popular creators, I love making levels, but I'm not a famous player, and 2.2! Where are you?

game, only, This game never gets old and it's pretty much the only game I play anymore. The only reason I knocked a star was due to the load-save system. There are many reviews with issues but none apply to me as I regularly save, except it will only save current data if I have gained stars. This only happens on mobile and I have lost progress and coins on many levels as a result.

account, other, Its good, but it always logs me out of my account when I reload the game, so If I spend ages making a level, it will just get removed and I won't see it again because it would've logged me out again and it didn't save on the other account. Please fix this.
good, Sooo, Sooo good!!
issue, same, It isn't beginner friendly and the fact that when I tap it doesn't jump is Bs. It isn't "user error" because my friends have the same issue. It ruins the entire experience.

update, new, I might regret what I said about that I would never play this game. I said I wouldn't. But still did anyway. I'm a little more interested in the game now because of the new 2.2 update. So I gave it 2 more stars for 2.2. Happy Halloween!
