is, game, great, This, Okay now this one is way scarier than the 1st one due to the laptop turning off, the owl either going to the left or right vents, and the golden egg. Man I love these kind of games cuz mostly I watch Youtubers play it and I said to myself would I dare myself to play these games and so I played them and I got jumpscared mostly. This is a great game for people that are related to fnaf.
's, screen, black, it, This game is great however i can't play it now for some reason when i open it it's a black screen
's, balance, perfect, It, Better than FNAF. Unlike in the original where you only really need the cameras for comfort, since you always have the lights, in this one every single camera comes to use. This makes this game so much more frantic, and you are on your toes one hundred percent of the time. It's a perfect balance of fast paced intensity and horror. The art and background music are fantastic too, they create a unique atmosphere which still manages to be scary. Gem. Love ya Jon.
