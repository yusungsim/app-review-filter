NOUN, ADJ, 
mechanics, new, This is a must buy if you enjoy the Kingdom Rush Saga. Playing as the villain is definitely badass, and the new mechanics that they added make this game a 5/5 for me!
things, extra, Love the animation, the characters, the gameplay and the attention to detail and the amount of extra things happening is really good
game, Great, Great game, but sad that after paying for the game there are still heroes and towers that have to be bought
Game, short, Game too short and you guys add pay to win towers.
version, casual, Being the best tower defense series on mobile, this is the light/lazy/casual version of Kingdom Rush. It is short, unpolished and unappeling. It is no surprize they went in this direction. Popularity drives many developers down the casual line. It still works okay, but there are so many cheesy elements and "surprises" that feels that they do not belong in the series. They should have focused on the old school mechanics. I finished the game in two days on veteran difficulty and will not return.

system, new, I don't like how they handled the new tower upgrade system as the old system was better in my opinion. I like the variety of towers but for a paid game asking for more is a lot so I haven't used any of the paid items. I've been playing since the original kingdom rush and this one feels more focused on in game transactions than ever. also going from origins with many free heros this game only having 3 was disappointing especially after I already paid for the game.

choices, more, I like the customization aspect on heros a lot better but there's less upgrade options it looks like and more choices for towers. Too much to choose. Choice paradox.

game, bad, Edit: The 1 ⭐ review is a result of making a bad game. The pay to play mechanic is just the cherry on the top of the whole experience. The worse game of the series. I hate all the changes that were made and now they sell you towers and heros. Shame on the developer for leaching off their fans.

towers, interesting, I played the original Kingdom Rush when it first came out and as soon as I saw this on the store I bought it. The game play is smooth, lots of interesting new enemies/towers, and of course all the cool achievements you can get with clicking around the map. Its great to have another Kingdom Rush!!

game, good, I agree this game is achievable without making in game purchases, i haven't even used gems yet either. Its a good game and I'm excited for the Shaolin forest expansion.
game, best, Kingdom Rush simply hold the title of best tower defense game ever, no other td come close to it
gamers, other, I've given every Kingdom Rush game 5 stars so far. What happened? This is coming from someone who's beaten the other gamers on the hardest difficulty. I have a strange feeling that the difficulty was cranked to encourage spending on micro transactions, which is a really sad thing to see. This isn't the fun kind of difficult. It feels like every tower has been nerfed, maps are balanced poorly, and enemies are badly thought out. Save your cash and buy the previous entries. They're far better.

game, fun, It's a really fun game. I'm a big fan of Iron Hide games. However, this one is a bit buggy. I've had multiple levels that would progress after the final wave. It is a game breaking bug. Would by 5 stars otherwise

Just wanna say you guys are awesome, keep making fun games. -an old fan (just wanna say maybe make premium content available if you get all stars or something, iron and heroic too, like some reward system?)

quality, high, This is the 3rd kingdom rush game of the series that I'm playing. Everything is amazingly done. Thanks, Ironhide team for this high quality content. One thing that I did not quite understand is that in the beginning of a round before any wave you cannot sell the towers for its original cost, that's kind of annoying sometimes when you are planning your base. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose, at least in the other games of the series you could sell it for its original cost.

games, better, The fact that they make this game paid for and still have the heroes and towers paid for is the worst. This game is garbage. Ironhide needs to make better games than this. The whole gimick of this game is that there are more towers and you can choose what towers to bring into battle except most of them are paid for and 3 to 5 dollars each. You can only choose between 15 towers and 3 heroes unlike origins which let you choose from 5 heroes. The once you need to buy aren't even that strong. Waste$

games, previous, Level design, animation and gameplay are all great as per the previous Kingdom Rush games. If this was a standalone game I'd probably be rating it 5. But the new tower setup really bothers me. At first it seems fun to be able to pick before each level, but you soon realise that adding this gameplay element takes away level strategy too much. Start with the wrong tower set and you'll fail no matter what.

game, full, Gameplay is great. But contents price for heros or towers is blood sucker. For full game u need to spend 40$ plus. I know the game can be complete without purchasing anything but it make the game less fun and make u feel disappointed because u missing lot of content. It's not fair for Android user that have to pay more than pc game that only 20$ for full game and android user pay double the price. Even some best pc game that 30$ come to android or ios for only 10$. Iron Hide is so greed.

games, prior, I initially gave this game 5 stars as I have with all of the prior Kingdom Rush series games. However, once you approach the end of the standard campaign, the difficulty becomes nearly impossible, especially once you try the additive campaigns. I paid for the game, but I refuse to pay more money for additional in game content. The 2 exit system on every level combined with ineffective towers and poor hero tanks make the difficulty intolerable, even on casual difficulty. I am disappointed.

money, more, I initially gave this game 5 stars as I have with all of the prior Kingdom Rush series games. However, once you approach the end of the standard campaign, the difficulty becomes nearly impossible, especially once you try the additive campaigns.

parts, other, The levels (design) are really stupid in comparison with the other parts, especially 1-2. Why would someone consider interesting to always have two exit points which you must defend vigorously by jumping every second from one to another. Are these levels designed to bring you joy or anxiety? Play them and answer that question for yourself.
weeks, few, I had purchased this game a while ago. But, started playing it a few weeks now. Love the game like the previous editions. Little bit harder to finish all 26 stages in normal difficulty level. I liked that I can choose the towers before starting the stages & selecting tower is part of the strategy. But, I could not find the Endless stage like previous edition. Is there any Endless stage?? if there is one, how do I unlock it?!

heroes, new, I've regret buying this game, First i enjoyed the game because of new heroes ,towers, And skills.after playing for a long time i was getting bored Other towers still needs money to use In short this game Is Pay To Win Even though you've payed for the game and unfortunately i cannot request a refund. I've requested an refund but it said that i can only refund a purchase after 7 days But i already regret buying it after 4 days . I NEED A REFUND I DEMAND A REFUND. (Edited)

design, great, I love the game so much. I bought everything (tower,hero) and they are all great and well design.BUT there is one thing that make the game boring is that when you finish all the level it's getting boring like i know you cannot to every day content but at least make like you know a survival level like the other.One like it's endless wave and it show all the enemy and it's getting harder and harder but like I said the game in design is perfect!

others, many, I played all of the kingdom rush games and this one is just what you would expect. It's interesting and different enough to be worth playing. As many others have said they're a bit overzealous with the microtransactions. The game is also oddly balanced. I'm not sure what they can do to fix it but the difficulty is very inconsistent.
transactions, Charging, Fun game. Charging and micro transactions is dumb
towers, Most, Game is designed to be finished without buying anything? Funny how they don't tell you that BEFORE you (don't) BUY the game! Most towers are useless, VERY expensive. Gameplay is so wonky. Strategy game where sometimes things work (electric pylons at exit, et al) and mostly don't! You cannot use strategy if your tools work randomly! Imagine chess where all pieces used random play? You have such a loyal fan base. We know you don't have VALVE money, neither do we! 1,2 & 3 were great! Make 5 epic!

towers, more, I already finished the game and I was getting very bored, also I hope you add more towers, a larger map, more heroes, and more mercenaries. Better add more things to this game so this game gets better.

issues, freezing, i have wasted a money on this, there's a freezing issues..iron marines and KRF worth the money..but this one is a total trash, even if you play the veteran mode it's pretty easy plus the freezing and glitch problems really annoying. would i get the refund.

difference, only, The only difference with this one and their other games is that you can choose 5 different towers to place on any level and they are automatically allowed to be upgraded to max level. The only complaint I have is I tried to play this on my new Samsung a12 but it keeps on freezing so I'm still playing it on on my old phone. Overall pretty fun to play as the bad guy.

transactions, many, So many transactions for a $7, you only get three heros but you can buy 400. The most expensive game in the series but also the worst. Would like a refund please. Don't buy.

level, second, always been a fan. however, I beat the second level of the snow expansion, and it glitches and never ends despite there being no enemies left. Game is really good, however it is too easy, even on the hardest difficulty. The previous games were much more challenging, I wish this one was harder

game, good, The game is balanced without paying, there are tutorials how to play the game. If you like it you can purchase some in game items and you will be supporting this good game.
game, Great, Great game, own it on pc already. The price of the micro-transactions in comparison to the pc brings the rating down
game, good, really good game nothing wrong with it except how short it was but that's not a big deal I still like messing around

model, shameful, Paid for the game to discover that there are in app purchases afterwards. What a shameful business model.
methods, predatory, I've been playing Kingdom Rush games since I was a child. The strategy, graphics, amount of content, and level of polish have only increased with each game, this one probably being the best so far. The reason I only give 4/5 stars though is because of the predatory monitization methods used in a PAID game. I know it's most likely corporate pressure that cause these changes and not the developers themselves. No hate. It doesn't matter if the game is still balanced, it's just a shame.

fan, massive, I am a massive fan of the Kingdom rush series and have played all of the previous 3 games. However this just falls short. The character designs are nowhere near as fluent and sleek as the earlier games. I understand that these are the "bad guys" and are meant to look demonic or evil, but even evil characters can be pretty cool looking. I only played the first couple of levels and then got bored. Please bring back the orginal design and aesthetics.

game, shallowest, The shallowest game of the franchise. Fun to try all the towers out but you can only enter a level with 5 chosen towers compared to the previous entries where you essentially had 8 different towers in each level. This put together with an unskippable tutorial, the stars not buying upgrades AND only 25% of the upgrades being to do with towers is very disappointing. Come on guys, bring it back for your long time fans.

games, Best, Best tower defence games comes from Iron hide. Have been buying their games since 2015
game, Awesome, Awesome game! Since now i could cash, buying the premium towers is so worth it. I just wish there are more towers and maybe more free heroes? Really recommend this game as the tower deck building allows for customisation although sometimes you will feel a little lost.

maps, Challenging, Challenging maps early on, engaging gameplay that doesn't hold your hand too much for familiar players of the game. I like the alternate premise of the story, and the art and music is excellent! The call outs of your troops can get a tad repetitive and they are quite unpleasant in the first place. Overall a good addition to the series and I'm glad I downloaded it.

Overall a good addition to the series and I'm glad I downloaded it.
play, good, Pretty good game play but wish there was a speed up option
review, Honest, Honest review. The gameplay is awesome the hidden Easter eggs in each map is also cool and the towers and heroes are unique enough that it make a difference from what you pick. The graphics are solid and the artwork is very good My problem is the fact that a major part of the enjoyment is hidden behind a 40$ paywall. I wouldn't have minded had it been 10 or 5 but 40$ to have more than 3 heroes? Or (4-8$ each) Towers you do get more option when you only buy the game but the paid ones are superior

game, Beautiful, Beautiful game. Levels are sometimes too easy.
game, solid, It is a solid game worth to receive 5 stars, however due to the fact that this premium gam has microtransactions for heroes, I can't give it more then 4.

games, favorite, Waiting for legends of kingdom rush please release these are my all time favorite games
difficulties, multiple, This game is fun, has multiple difficulties for different people and skill levels and a good amount of content. I particularly like the extra hidden quests in each level. Most of the towers and heroes are viable and suitably unique to make them all enjoyable to play around with. In my personal opinion, some towers are slightly too weak or strong. The game is very fun overall and the story is fun.

game, Great, Great game! Just finished the whole plot a moment ago without buying any premium towers, heroes, etc. The game really is designed to be perfectly balanced without having to purchase anything to finish the game. Enjoyed it!

content, new, I am new to the series and I love how the developers are constantly coming up with new content. I have tried a lot of the rush games and these are some of the most entertaining.
game, grate, Bast one yet grate game
time, extra, It has been a joy to spend my extra time playing this game. I burned out on TD games almost a decade ago; KR has been a welcome return to a favorite genre.

ones, like, You get the game and get 3 heros. The like 8 other ones are behind a pay wall and the cheapest is 2$. The towers you place are also behind a pay wall.

game, latest, I have been playing Kingdom Rush games since day one. I even was a Kickstarter for their board game. After paying 5 dollars for the latest game to see thst there was easily another 30-60$ of additional content to purchase really has left a sour taste in my mouth. I understand they are a "small dev" and I've given nothing but support to them over the years... just kind of sucks that this wasn't a free game considering the amount of dlc OR more content included in the 5$ price tag

system, new, I do think Origins us a bit better and I think some of the bosses are a bit under welming . I do think the new tower system is pretty good and unique.
favourite, least, Probably my least favourite of the kingdome rush series. More pay to play features, towers have a weird range where its weird to experience during gameplay that a tower that should he within range of attack but doesn't because it's to far. But there side by side basically lol. Still fun though

games, most, As with most Ironhide games this is absolutely amazing. Very well put together and polished. I just wish they had all their games available for Android!!!!
thing, only, I really enjoy this game. The only thing I would like as an addition is a fast forward button because sometimes the rounds take a long time. 15 round stages could be A lot faster if I could fast forward the first 7 waves until the little more intense ones pop up in half the time. I mostly play this on my break at work and you can only do so much in 30-45 minutes

version, worst, This is the worst version of KR ive played. It now charges for the inital game AND heroes AND towers! The animations aren't as good as previous installments. You cant sell towers for their full price during inital level setup. Theres a long list of small things that make this game bad. Play the other KR games instead if you haven't.

upgrades, cool, Fun game. Love all of them. Dope art style. cool upgrades for towers. Normal mode is difficult enough to be a good time killer, but all the bonus modes add for good replay challenge.

content, locked, Purchased the game but a lot of locked content hidden behind a pay wall. I'm an early adopter and have purchased all previous games before they were for free. In past versions, you had access to more champions and the full spectrum of towers. Unfortunately, the feeling I'm getting is that they delivered the least amount for the most they can get away with. Really disappointed with this one. Also, looking at other reviews, many of people are saying the same thing - listen to your consumer base!

Really disappointed with this one. Also, looking at other reviews, many of people are saying the same thing - listen to your consumer base!

levels, Uneven, Game is good but not as much as kingdom rush. Uneven levels and they want you to pay for goodies. Shouldn't have in app purchases when you have to pay for the game.

rush, Best, Best rush so far by far!
game, Best, Best ironhide game yet!
device, modern, Game is not optimized for modern device with ultra widescreen display, you will lose anywhere from 13-15% vertical field of view compare to standard 16:9 display, what's more disappointing is that I bought this concern to the developer yet I was told the game was fine as the way it is even though all of the previous Kingdom Rush games got update with ultra widescreen fully supported.

game, great, It's great game except for the price of heroes and tower is too expensive.
style, nice, Really nice art style
mode, endless, Not happy that there is no endless mode! I do like switching out the towers idea.
installment, latest, Why is the latest installment of Kingdom Rush lack of ultra widescreen support on mobile devices, unlike previous Kingdom Rush games it got update to fully utilized ultra widescreen. KR Vengeance when play my Galaxy S8, it reduced vectical field of view by 15%.

mission, long, Too difficult. 5 minute placing towers and 20 minute-long mission only to miss some sneaky guy at the end ignore defenders and run by? And have to start all the way from beginning? It's bad game design, it's just frustrating and not fun. Maybe checkpoints of something would fix that, but right now I gave up on level 4 after restarting it like 15 times.

screen, black, Currently, the game needs to be opened twice before it can be played. I'm using Poco F2 Pro. If I don't do that, the game just stuck in a black screen. I hope the devs will fix this issue.
games, previous, A bit disappointed. The previous games allowed a bit of variety of towers here you can just choose 5

addition, Great, Great addition to the KR franchise, i'm really liking the new mechanic wehre you can choose what tower you bring to each level, it's pretty short lengthwise, even for a kingdom rush game. Most of the towers are locked behind paywall, while you don't need them to finish the game it still sucks to not be able to experience the full game, i'd really like it if we can grind for currency to get the towers

rush, worst, Maybe the worst kingdom rush since the original, the balance is way worst than the other games. I still buy all the heroes and Tower just to appreciate the game before this one. Hope you guys make another great game. 😊 Oh... And the game have issues with the constant black screen, after you switch the app to other app, so you need to close and open it again to fix this.

The reply below is disingenuous as best given the in game purchase charge levels. Sold as a premium game in reality this is a money grabbing freemium model with *huge* additional changes if you actually want to play effectively. Eg all but 3 heroes locked behind a paywall.

game, excellent, Another excellent tower defence game made by ironhide! Addicting but not much to expect once you complete it. I have some suggestion tweaks: buff darknights when shield is active it will still pick an enemy if current is killed and hp regen when shield is active, cheaper instakill price. buff mortemis zombies max numbers. NEW tower: a barrack tower that solely acts like the "walking dead" upgrade of bone flingers. Sandbox and endless mode for EVERY level after you complete it.

game, Purchased, Purchased game recently, very polished looking and the new additions are great (towers, heroes, power ups) as well as the switch from good side to evil side. BUT while good in these ways, there are glaring bugs that are noticed right off the bat, one being missing sfx sounds, and another being missing names for barracks soldiers. (There names instead are whatever you last clicked). I've tried restarting phone, reinstalling game, no fix. Without bugs this is a 5/5.

gameplay, Delightful, Delightful gameplay. There is a Deep Ones tower. As a fan of HP Lovecraft I appreciate that. Plus I love all the movie and shows references you find throughout the game. Darkness has a particular esthetic I appreciate and this game carries it well in a cartoony way.

games, older, Still fun but miss the older kingdom rush games. First three and iron marines 5 stars.
towers, extra, This game is so fun and addicting I also dont mind buying the extra towers and players you can beat it with or without the help
tower, challenging, A fun challenging tower defence game but let down by the game randomly freezing at the end of a level, forcing you to redo it again. You also get hounded to leave a review
money, real, The game is good. The fact that you have to spend real money to buy some of the tower options is not cool. I would much rather pay a base fee and get everything.
version, mobile, Fun game that you expect from Kingdom Rush but why is the Encyclopedia of enemies and towers not included in the mobile version? Feels like a weird thing to omit.. Updated to 4 stars. Why not 5? Missing encyclopedia and it's a shorter game from the other Kingdom Rush games..

selection, reduced, With a heavily reduced selection of towers per level (going from a veriety of 8 to a max variety per level of 5) this newest addition to their series had a rocky start. I played through it anyway and behold, more than half of their towers are locked behind a paywall as a "dlc" despite never having done this before. To make matters worse, the towers you pay for are CLEARLY better than the free ones, and give you such an advantage you almost need them to beat many of the levels on hard.

game, single, I have played every single kingdom rush game including iron marines and still dissappointed that you did not give android the legends of kingdom rush i was hyped for it and you ruined it for me
game, good, Very good game. Ironhide did a supreme job making this, the ability to swap out the type of towers at you disposal keeps the game intersting and fun all the way through. The art is absolutly wonderful, bight and new, while also not betraying that classic kingdom rush style. I will, however, say it is a little wierd to be playing as the BBEG from the first game

game, worth, Fun game, definitely worth the price.
Itsa, good, Itsa good
game, Nice, Nice game but a LOT of stuff is locked. You buy a premium game but only three base heroes are unlocked and about half the towers. The rest you have to spend like 3€ each to unlock. I really don't recommend unless you spend other 20€ or so. Disappointing and greedy, completely ruined my experience.

playthroughs, casual, Been playing iron hide's games for years and loved every single one. They're very well thought out games and perfect for casual and hardcore playthroughs
game, good, A good kingdom rush game
money, additional, Pay a premium to buy the game, then you need to pay additional money for the best towers in this tower defence game. Something I would expect from a free game.

content, full, Paywalled towers on an already $5 game is rough. Love the game, but for $40 for full content of heroes and towers I expect a much much longer campaign.

graphics, Great, Great graphics and easy controls, super interesting story for a bad guy centered game where you are fighting the good guys. Love the subtle little twists some levels will introduce and how intricate the game play is. The tower designs are phenomenal. Overall I rate it 5 stars for keeping me engaged for 2 and half years still.

edition, great, Played via the Google play pass. Definitely a great edition to ironhide's TD games. Wish there was a 2x speed button though. Still great regardless!
games, favorite, One of my favorite games iv ever played on my phone!
game, great, Fun game for the price, great on tablets
levels, more, Love the game and achievements! I just wish there are more levels in Kingdom Rush games
game, great, Amazing. Truly a great game. I must say what's with the in app purchases? The game is already so 3ish dollars.

rush, great, Another great kingdom rush game.i think this the 4th? I have played them all and enjoy this one as much as the others.

freezing, constant, Would've given 5 stars but the constant freezing of the game at launch or randomly while I'm playing is really starting to get unbearable. I really like the towers and levels, but it's hard to have fun when the game freezes when your at the end of the level... If the developers can fix these issues, then vengeance would be a 5 star game.
towers, different, i enjoy the idea of having different towers that you can equip and unequip into the loadout. it brings alot more variety to this game in comparison to previous kingdom rush games. although it is a good addition i dont think these certain towers should be available for purchase. i would much rather have additional challenges or achievement rewards give the extra towers so you dont have to pay for extra towers to use and just leave the heroes purchasable instead.

boy, bad, The myth, The Man, The legend. That's what I'm thinking when I see this bad boy return to reclaim the world, this game will put your mind to the edge to finish every single level, but it's quite a downgrade especially with the towers where you need to buy unique towers and the perks leveling are less than kingdom rush before this.

games, available, Legitimately one of the best available tower defense games! Slight changes in terms of tower progression, but I'm actually beginning to prefer it compared to previous titled. Although microtransactions exist, the game is still very playable without spending any money, it's mainly for specialized heroes, but vanilla heroes are great all the way through late game. Overall, excellent title from a fantastic series. Thank you all at Ironhide, and keep up the great work !!

game, great, This is a great defense game. No ads and there are upgrades. The game is a slow paced time waster. Besides a speed button, I would LOVE to know how many kills a tower has. But other than that, another great game from ironhide.

guy, bad, Hurray for the bad guy
level, sixth, The game is really hard like really really hard but once you beat the sixth level it gets way better you unlock the Dark Knight which I've been wanting for a while I just got them actually. There is also a ton of interactive things on levels like on level six if you go to a lava pool you can see a Terminator reference and also a Simpson one and a different level.

games, other, Yes team thanks for getting back to me. I don't really mind downloading again, it just means I have to play it from the beginning again. Anyway, with this game. I LOVED it as I do the other Kingdom Rush games. Feel dumb coz I only just realised I'm playing on the villain's side 😅 and I was thinking the whole game that damn the opposition looks like the good guys on the other games and then I read the title Vengeance....yes makes sense 🤦‍♀️I enjoyed it, my kids now enjoy it too on their ipads!

selection, limited, After thinking about it, 3 stars is to harsh. The game is great, just the weakest of the kingdom rush games imo. I feel like the tower variety suffered a lot due to the limited selection during a game and general balancing. After unlocking the bone throwers and mausoleum, I found myself not using anything else due to them being both good dps and great blocking towers. I definitely preferred to older style where each tower has a set of very distinct upgrade paths.

mod, infinite, Really fun as all KR, but 2 requests : an infinite mod and another save emplacement
fun, Super, I've bought every Kindom Rush game and this is my favorite one. When i first got this game it seemed a little weird because It was a little slow but then I got used to it and now I love it. They replaced using your stars to buy stuff to getting souls and you can upgrade a bunch of things. And sadly they removed the feature to use the book to look what types of enimes there are. But other than that you should definitely buy this game. Super fun.
play, hard, Unfortunately I can't refund anymore, but after giving it a hard play I just give up. This should be a free to play game since there's blatant ftp mechanics. Locked heroes, towers, and abilities. This is grotesquely greedy. The levels aren't very well designed and the heroes are even worse, such as the free ranger character. You have to force a RANGED hero into melee to use their strongest ability. The other heros and towers should be unlockable through gems like previous games, awful pay to win

bucks, few, Probably the best TD game I've played in years. A few bucks for hours of months of entertainment? Deal
developer, same, I've played another game from the same developer - it's also called Kingdom rush something. And it's was a decent game until about a dozen levels later there's enemies that freeze or lock your towers and the only way to unlock these is to click multiple times on each. Same here. This needless clicking completely breaks gameplay for me and turns what is otherwise is a pretty good tower defense game into another unplayable silly clicker.

And it's was a decent game until about a dozen levels later there's enemies that freeze or lock your towers and the only way to unlock these is to click multiple times on each. Same here. This needless clicking completely breaks gameplay for me and turns what is otherwise is a pretty good tower defense game into another unplayable silly clicker.

series, favorite, been playing these games since they launched on kongregate and still my all time favorite game series to this date. from the music and the voice talent, graphics to story line. and sooo many easter eggs along the way! these games never have gotten old and never will kerp up the amazing work IronHide or as shatra would say Edih Nori!

phone, modern, It's unacceptably buggy. On a modern phone (S10+) it refuses to open and gets stuck on black screen half the time, and now SFX sound completely died and does not work anymore no matter what I do. The animations and game as a whole feels choppier and less smooth than the previous ones. Same gameplay, but the overall experience is significantly inferior. Not to mention it's way more in your face with all the microtransactions.

game, best, I love all Ironhide games. Especially the Kingdom Rush series. This is the best game on my phone for sure. Best studio ever! Thank you so much!

games, favorite, One of my favorite Kingdom Rush games, though I do miss the encyclopedia.
transactions, more, Are you kidding me Ironhide?! I buy this game after all this time to be met with more micro transactions and hero purchasing?! I was fine with that ton your free games but this...this is too far. Other than that detail, the game plays pretty good and I enjoy it.

worlds, whole, KR has always been special I've been paying since before they came to mobile, this installment in great I love the variety of towers and your ability to customize your loadout is sick. There's a bunch of towers and heros that I think would be really cool to be able to trial run/test for free before committing to buying, I think it would help me make the jump to potentially getting them permanently. Also I miss the encyclopedia out was just really cool to be able to see the whole worlds stats.
purchases, additional, Frustrating that there are so many in game additional purchases after paying for the game.
game, Great, Great nonpay-to-win game, and at the beginning of the game, it could be really challenging.
games, previous, You pay for a premium game and get a freemium game. Towers and heroes are locked behid a paywall. Also the pop-up asking to rate the game is verry aggresive. I still enjoy the game despite all this. The story is ok and the gameplay is great. I feel though that this game is a step down from the previous Kingdom Rush games. The frequent freezes and now the bug that removes the sfx are ruining the experience.

problems, slight, This game is amazing in every way even though there might be some slight problems the game is still amazing and its worth it to buy and play the game thank you for making this game amazing
game, good, good game but microtransaction hell even after paying a few bucks to play the game to begin with.
bucks, few, good game but microtransaction hell even after paying a few bucks to play the game to begin with.
graphics, fantastic, Like all kingdom rush games, this is fantastic, great graphics, features etc. I wish that you still had the encyclopedia, that really helped with strategizing and it was also fun to collect all the enemies as you went along. I do miss being able to use the stars for upgrades, I feel that there is less motivation to move through the levels. Any glitches/bugs I've had in the game have been fixed with Ironhide getting onto the problem quickly. 4.5 stars🤩

game, same, The same great game although more pay to win elements. They removed the challenges providing upgrades giving no incentive to do them at all. Still fun though

game, Good, Good game. After paying for it I am pretty disappointed that more than half the towers and characters are behind a considerable pay-wall. Seems greedy to me. Hmmm, enjoying the game in its entirety but having hero's and towers behind a pay wall. I don't see how that tallies.

fans, big, I am a big fans of Kingdom Rush series and this game is absolutely my favourite in the KR franchise. The game was smooth and lot of improvement especially in towers and heroes. The only downside for this game is the price for towers and heroes to costly, if you can inflate the price it would be much better.

mode, endless, This is the best one in my opinion mainly because you get the most tower variety. It is a little short though. And the lack of an endless mode or something keeps it from 5 stars.
level, last, Game crashes during last level of the kingdom area right before the end so I can't progress the game.

story, typical, I always love being the villain in Video games it feels satisfying turning the typical story to fit the villains side. The purchases seem pretty reasonable for the cost of towers and heroes, overall this game was a 10/10 for me :) I just wish there was the info booklet in the mobile version TwT

heroes, free, Three free heroes is too small a roster. Difficulty of the levels beyond the campaign no longer feels justified compared to previous games- there was always a way, but it was possible. Now, you NEED to spend money to buy the inventory items- or these additional levels are impossible, even with the premium content towers. And again ... THREE free heroes?!? Ironhide, what the eff???

screen, black, Game never starts correctly, always a black screen, have to quit and open again.
time, next, Nothing like the others, just a waste of money and potential .Better luck next time...
time, all, An all-time fan of the franchise, I am not disappointed by this installment of Kingdom Rush. With all options unlocked through the Google Play pass, the game offers a good variety of towers, levels and heroes. Not sure what the other versions are worth though!

games, only, Kingdom Rush are the only tower defense games I have ever enjoyed. I've been playing since they were a flash game on Kongregate, and they have been so consistently fun. Nothing bad to say whatsoever.
fan, big, So good. I've been a big fan since the first one came out online. Just worked my way through the previous 3 games which is a must due to the storyline. All of their games are good but they've outdone themselves with this one 👍🏻

heroes, cool, It is very fun though I don't like how it locks some very cool heroes and towers behind a paywall.
version, fun, It is a pretty fun version of the Kingdom Rush series, definitely worth the money spent.

entry, great, Really great entry into the series, definitely worth it for the price. The only downside is that a lot of the (granted, optional) towers and heroes are locked being paywalls which lower the value for money. You don't need them, but would be nice not to have to inflate the cost of the game for some interesting looking mechanics.

guys, bad, Ironhide making another 5 star game for the Kingdom Rush series... Playing the bad guys with Vez'nan felt sooooo good...;-)
idea, good, The game was very smooth and very fresh and to play as the villains was a really good idea but I would make one of the bought hero's free like you did with frontiers and origins as well as make some things a tad bit cheaper and to add some kind of survival just like the last three games because that is something that is dearly missing

days, few, I bought it recently and was really excited. Unfortunately, the game is nearly unplayable. After every level and almost every time I launch the game it crashes. My progress has been reset twice already and I've only had it a few days. However, when I do manage to get into a level it runs perfectly and is super fun. Just so frustrating getting to that part. Help would be appreciated. Update: Been a good few months now and even though I've been emailing with support they've still not fixed it.

Frontiers, favorite, I bought this app because...well I buy all their apps. It was slightly different than my favorite (Frontiers) so I shelved it. Decided the time had arrived to play it. Sooooo friggin' good! For those of you wondering, as usual you don't need a red penny beyond buying the game to beat it. If you want world domination quickly then sure buy the heroes, but it always comes down to the choices you make re:- towers etc. No scam here...fun,fun,fun!

game, great, This is just a great game
games, other, It's hard to compare this with the other kingdom rush games, but its becoming one of my favorites. The only downside is no enemy encyclopedia. It's very different than the other ones, but I enjoy that they tried something new!

screen, constant, Love ironhide but this ones the worst. Just constant screen tapping and using the special items, much less strategy, worse towers by far, and more expensive? Regret the purchase.

fraction, small, Game costs $50 not $5. $5 unlocks some small fraction of gameplay. Seriously chalk full of extremely expensive content. I'm so sick of piece meal gaming buying one charter or tower at a time. It is like you really just buy a trial version. Just make a full game that isn't pay to play and then be honest up front that your grubby company want $100 for the game.

move, bad, Really dont like the fact that you need to buy the game and on top you need to buy extras seperately. =\ very bad move by dev
twist, nice, Definitely a nice twist of TD gameplay--still as immersive as the first Kingdom Rush.

game, Amazing, Amazing game. My only complaint is I think there should be a way to unlock all the towers and heroes through playtime. It can be really hard but it should be possible.

phones, smart, The form factor of the screen is not really designed for smart phones and therefore one can only see half of the game during gameplay.
levels, more, Fun but constantly crashes, should have more levels and towers available, story is kinda short

adjustements, unique, The best one out of the series tbh. Sticking to their game art and play style but added unique and game changing adjustements compared to the other 3 series of the game. This one tops the others. Just like the other ones. No pay to win. Love the story line. Amazing game overall. Just sometimes crashes.

money, extra, I really like it, I just don't like that you usually only have one hero, and that it costs extra money to get the better heroes and towers. I am waiting for the switch version where it is all paid for at once for a lower cost. On the upside, the customization of which towers to use is new and pretty cool. I am still only on level 5 though so time will tell if the earlier towers become too weak to do much and you have to only select the later ones. So far, I really like it. The story is fun.

experience, fun, This game is like Dark Souls! Not the fun DS experience but a frustrating one. I played all KR games, because it's my fav series, and I will admit that I can't beat any of them on hard mode but the normal dificulty on this is just as punishing. What the heck? Tone down the difficulty a bit, I repeat, Normal mode is too hard.

game, grubbing, Money grubbing game compared to the older much better versions. Doesn't matter how well you do in the game anymore... Skill points don't come from achievement stars.. They just push you through the game and push in-game purchases to unlock content you already paid for. There's no incentive to go through the hard mode or iron fist mode anymore. Simply not as fun as the older versions. Good story and stuff but really leaves an empty feeling as you play.. Not as rewarding nor fun as the older ones

waste, massive, Disappointing rip-off that blatantly values income more than fun. Pay to buy it, pay to use heroes, pay, pay, pay, keep paying. Buy a hero, just to watch it ignore enemies and lose games. Disappointing, annoying, a massive waste of money and time for very little fun. Do not recommend.

complaint, only, I've played a lot of castle defense and this might be in my top 3. It's fun and the only complaint I have is I sometimes get to caught up in it. Kingdom rush has done it again.
defense, great, Really great tower defense. Hope they keep up the good work in this franchise and release more content.

graphics, better, Better than expected despite what some YouTube reviewers said. Not as good as Origins, but definitely better than Frontiers with far better graphics too... Yes there are pay to win towers but that's just for those who can't basically manage the game with basic towers.

games, previous, shorter and dumbed down compared to previous two games... Upgraded to 4 stars. I just like this game. I wish the upgrade system was a little more expanded and there were real numbers on everything.. but it is so fun.

map, whole, Other 3 let you zoom in and out this one is zoomed in way to far and won't let you zoom out to see the whole map! But in Ironhide tradition game start good they get you money and stop caring about the game and you!!
thing, only, I loved this game so much! The genius writing and story making has left me speechless! You feel compelled to root for the heros you know and love but you also want to root for Vez'nan. The only thing that kept this from five stars is that for the most expensive game in the series you don't get acess to all the towers, and I'm not a big fan of the new tower mechanic. They also got rid of the encyclopedia and endless levels. But other than those two things this game is beautiful and worth the buy!

games, other, Kingdom Rush fans will enjoy. I've played through all the Kingdom Rush games and I have always liked the genre. This is no exception. The tower variance is better than the other games in the series, as well as how to utilize them.
games, other, Not up to the standard of other KR games. Pay $$ for towers, talent tree not as thought out, no incentive for heroic mode. Practically a Gacha game, there are so many pay to win mechanics added.

option, second, So Vengeance is definitely different from the rest of the series. You no longer get stars for doing iron and elite stages. The upgrade system has been redone. The towers are different, by not giving you a second option of the final upgrade. Instead you choose up to 5 towers to bring into the stage with you and there's good variety for it. Other than those major changes, it's the same formula with playing as vez' nan. I still love the series and am glad they're trying new things

The towers are different, by not giving you a second option of the final upgrade. Instead you choose up to 5 towers to bring into the stage with you and there's good variety for it. Other than those major changes, it's the same formula with playing as vez' nan. I still love the series and am glad they're trying new things
addition, Great, Great addition to the series. Gives a bit of tactical creativity to the players.

ones, previous, Ok do the game is good but it's not as good as the previous ones. The level design are well done. The monetization has been better, but is understandable. Main problem with the game is the way they redid the tower system. Monetization aside it's limited to one tree per tower, severely limiting your options from 8 in the previous games to 5. It gives less freedom and limits the options for enjoying the game. Tower levels 1-3 are basically the same so the uniqueness is cool but pointless.

game, Great, Great fun game. I would recommend
addition, fine, It's a fine addition to the franchise. However, the lack of an encyclopedia is disappointing. Also having to buy not only the heroes, but the towers too, sucks.
game, mobile, If I pay 5$ for a mobile game in the first place, there shouldn't be any content to buy in the game.

Towers, more, Hey I was rrally loving this Game Even spent Some money to Buy some towers, and For some Reason Today I go to log on and Everything Is Rest back to start. I have no more Towers or Heroes. Please fix this, Edited: Also I Have Payed for 2 Towers And Only 1 Is Popping Up.
game, fun, Very fun game
games, previous, Should have not remove the description of the enemy unit. should have put the books for description like from the previous frontier games, the encyclopedia. could have been better for paid game. More stages & less paid heros & towers.

heroes, powerful, A warning to others = In the description it says "13 powerful heroes" so me paying for a game just assumed that I would get said heroes but no, you get 3 and have to pay for the rest...the same goes for the towers,you only get about half. Maybe add this in the description? The game has a shocking amount of in game purchases.

game, best, The best Kingdom Rush game I played. Although there are a few bugs like taping on a troop has its name glitchy or copies a tower name. Overall, this game is very good
game, brilliant, Another brilliant game from Ironhide! Lots more options for Towers and Heroes make it that much more exciting!

put, Great, Great put features of frontiers and orgins into one game
strats, efficient, definitely takes some time to learn and figure out efficient strats but it's fun and immersive after that!
bugs, many, Fun game, but too many bugs. It freezes a lot on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ phone. I closed the app and opened it back up, but it doesn't start up still. I restarted my phone, but that didn't work either. It also won't stop bugging me about a review.
dragons, more, Best one yet I always wanted more dragons heroes well villain in this case but I mean I've played every one to till this I got the most enjoyment out of this game

game, paid, Micro transactions on a paid game for content is a bit disappointing. Otherwise a great TD!
game, little, Really sucks that you still need to pay for a lot of content even after purchasing the game. Edit... You only have access to half the towers if you BUY the game. Usually they just limit your access to heroes but in this one they really gave you 3 heroes out of like 12 and HALF the towers. Heard they were releasing a new Kingdom Rush soon. I'm not buying it unless it's fair. Like do they actually think their little game is worth 50$ CAD if you want access to all the content?
one, last, I enjoyed this game less than the last one. Maybe this should be a pc only game.
pay, many, Refunded due to the many pay to win options present in an already pricey app. You have to pay for towers, heroes, AND items. It is ridiculous.

guys, bad, I love this franchise and in this newest game you play as the bad guys rather then the humans. I'm really enjoying it so far.
options, multiple, Really fun and having multiple options for towers can be fun. But, the heroes are extremely clunky like Asra who won't attack ANYONE if they are close to the end stage after teleporting. Also the militia tower name glitch is just kind of jarring.
storyline, new, I totally love this kind of game tower Defense. I've played all the Ironhide developer game. Especially this type of TD all Kingdom rush from the beginning its created. Hopefully the story and the new storyline will come out with a new hero and tower. Better make a new one after this vengeance.

screen, black, Always black screen when opening the game. Always have to open it twice. And sometimes the loading screen is stuck. And at the start of gameplay when you're going to build a tower, the screen is stuck again...

time, first, The cutscenes before you enter a match get annoying when you're restarting and not entering it for the first time. The game also crashes from time to time. As for balancing, the game seems less balanced than the previous ones. The heroes seem to die too easily to dangerous threats, such as the armored polar bear or the dwarves' mechs. There's an excessive amount of ranged enemies at times. And lastly, some towers seem like they don't synergize well in any tower sets/loadouts.

kingdoms, Allied, Difference in this game is that you play as the Forces of Vez'nan against the Allied kingdoms from the first game. Instead of choosing a spec on level 3->4, all towers now upgrade to level 4. As you progress, you unlock new towers which you can swap out with the base 4 you are given. Some of the other reviews are saying that of course the paid towers are imbalanced, but thats expected and ive made good progress without any tower purchases. 7/10 i dont like the art style on the comic strips now

game, other, After every other Kingdom Rush game I had high hopes. Unfortunately this game was my least favorite. Still no enemy encyclopedia, and no real reason to complete every level beyond the first play through other than the normal campaign. And I know how much effort a static picture with some text in a game takes. Minimal at most. Just lazy game design and imo truly leaving behind the best parts of the first 3. Mediocre compared to the original. Better art and graphic design doesn't make a bettergame

ways, small, The game itself is amazing. In some small ways, it isn't quite as good as the previous three games (no encyclopedia, waves are slightly slower) but none of these are nearly severe enough to prevent me giving it 5 stars. There are micro-transactions, like the previous games, and, like those games, you don't need them to complete the game. The customer service is also amazing: a few days ago I lost my save progress: the helpful staff who I contacted restored it a few days later.

win, much, It's good. But ingame purchases are unnecessary and too much pay-to-win. I don't like even having the temptation to cheat, especially on the harder difficulties. I like to know the game was designed to be besten without such crutches at every difficulty level.

difficulty, good, Pros: -Game is good difficulty is right. -Game has a lot of towers. Cons: -No speedup button. -No priority target to focus on specific enemy. -Too much heroes to buy with real money. -Buy potions with gems but gems are rare... -Some minor info about each enemy or tower is not dispalyed for example attacks per second or dodge rate

game, Great, Great game, but not as good as the other three.
game, Good, Good game, however you will get spam notifications to "rate" app
addition, fun, And fun and interesting new addition the the Kingdom Rush franchise that finally allows you experiment with diverse tower setups for new strategies and themed builds to utilize! An excellent game.

game, fun, Very fun game. I really enjoy it! But it's a 3 star because there is a lot of in app game purchases for a game that already cost $5.
levels, more, Honestly I hope u make more levels I beat the game in legendary
game, Good, Good game just like the rest of the series!
twists, newest, I actually really enjoy a lot of the newest twists this game has to offer compared to the previous ones, i hope iron hide makes more heroes, towers, and levels in the future.

levels, more, I missed kingdom rush thats why I was happy when this came out! A bit more challenging than its predecessors, which is great. I just wish it were longer though. Please please please add more levels!!!
KRs, previous, The game plays very much like previous KRs, so if you liked those, you'll like this one. There's a few changes to the formula I'm not a fan of (individual towers with "premium" towers) but that's mostly taste. Not mine, maybe yours. The reason I'm giving this game three stars is because there's some incomprehensible regressions compared to previous KRs. No monster encyclopedia anywhere(!!!), selling towers before round 1 doesn't refund 100%, more & slower loading screens... Pass until fixed.

rush, other, not as expected to other rush i am not impressed this time
game, fun, Very fun game
areas, right, Just different enough in just the right areas! Thank you guys.
games, other, I love this game. Just wish it would work on my Chromebook like the other kingdom rush games. 👍👍😁
version, mobile, It only costs less than 20 dollars to buy this game inclusive of all heroes and towers on Steam. This mobile version is simply a rip-off.
types, different, I've played all of the kingdom rush games, and this one is the best. Graphics are great, gameplay is awesome, and I love how you can have a loadout of different types of towers each round. This game has inspired me to draw and maybe make a video game like this one day. It is a very good game not many things that you have to purchase in the game. In my opinion the kingdom rushes go in this order, kingdom rush vengeance, kingdom rush the original, kingdom rush origins, kingdom rush frontiers.

map, updated, The artwork on this updated map is stunning
fan, big, I have been a big big fan of the series since 2013. I really love kingdom rush vengeance specially for the graphics and newly designed interface. The difference can be seen between the previous versions of this game. Thanks for releasing this part as well. I hope to see another one very soon.

heros, more, Could open more heros without paywall
game, first, I have played kindom rush since the first flash game came out and this is the best one by far
layers, many, I enjoy this game. I just wish it didnt have so many layers of purchases.
graphics, Good, You have to buy things to win. Good graphics and fun but it's certainly a pay to play game. No ads which is nice.
tower, Excellent, Excellent tower defense game
game, Great, Great game. Similar enough to predecessors in the series that you can pick it right up. Lots of little details that make a complete experience. So far, I haven't felt the need to make additional purchases. Update: Dropping this to 2 stars. Hit a wall that I can't get past without in app purchase. That wouldn't be so bad if it were free. But I've already paid for it. shame.

TD, good, A very good TD , not the best from all the series IMO but a very good one , has diverse tower range and the ability to chose active towers and that feels great , skill selection kind of mimics the previous games but in the end they were very good and covered a lot of content . Recommended.

things, few, Another solid follow up to this series! But now that I have finished it, a few nitpicking things. First, after you complete the game you unlock the impossible difficulty. But there is no achievement listed for completing them, and each location icon doesn't update to show anything special for completing it on impossible. I would love to have an enemy index for each enemy type like in prior installments, and maybe a kill count indicator for each type. I would love mission expansion update too!

improvements, Great, Great graphic improvements and more variety of towers over the last Kingdom Rush games but I couldn't help but feel it lacked a lot in actual maps and content. I'm not sure if its the layout of some of the maps, or the lack of enemy waves but I found myself not enjoying it in a lot of places and only filling 25% to 50% of the available tower slots before the level was over. No endless mode here which reduces replayability also.

time, good, I remember playing the first one when it came out on my computer and absolutely loving it and when origins, frontiers and this one went on sale I bought them and played through all of them its nice to come back to this game every once and a while always a good time
game, earily, It's a little tough to figure the tower evolutions out but the earily game progresses well. It's a fun game that remains challenging and entertaining.

art, gorgeous, Fantastic! Simply the best TD game I've played. It delivers exactly what you want and expect from a TD game plus the gorgeous art and witty charm. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another TD game put into the android library. This game knocks its rivals into the stratosphere, irrelevant of the platform. It does have in-game purchases but you genuinely don't need to pay to win. Although, I made just one additional purchase of a cool dragon hero, but only because I like dragons!

kingdom, other, nothing like the other kingdom rushes. good graphics but i enjoyed how original and unique the other kingdom rushes were compared to this one. this one feels like a cash grab and its just not better than the older versions. if youre looking to play through all the kingdom rushs, this one by far is the least enjoyable. and thats sad to say cus i played kingdom rush when it first came out on kongregate.

job, Excellent, Excellent job but the game is already have a price. İn ap purchases is too expensive than others an in gameplay to earn ruby is soo hard
charges, additional, I tried buying the "Unlock all towers pack" and got charged 3 times ($14.99) and haven't even received the pack! I want a refund for the 2 additional charges and my pack I paid for then I'll change my review.
hour, first, In my first hour of playing i have faced game freeze bug twice... it's horrible i am doing a refund
game, solid, This is a very solid TD game. The gameplay is entertaining and the graphics are really nice. There are paid towers and heroes which are cool but they're optional, I can finish the game without them.
paywalls, extra, Played on the Google subscription pass and was great. Decided to buy the game after the month trial ended and now half the towers / characters I was using are locked behind extra paywalls now. Which is such a scam!! It also won't let me get a refund for some reason either...
research, more, Wish it had more in depth research but it's definitely enjoyable as you progress. One of the best tower defense games out there.

money, real, It's really good, but annoying how you have to pay for most of the hero's and towers with real money when this is a payed game anyways.
game, payed, It's really good, but annoying how you have to pay for most of the hero's and towers with real money when this is a payed game anyways.
towers, best, Some of the best towers and heroes are stuck behind a paywall, in this case i bought what i wanted... i think it was worth it. Do not buy the goblin balloon tower, while flavorful, it sucks, and it feels bad to drop a tower you paid for lol. The doom tank is a great hero, i recommend it. The lazer tower and fishman tower are quite fun, i recommend those as well.

help, little, I love the game it's really fun but I have a problem. I accidentally uninstalled the game while trying to free some space but when I reinstalled all my progress was still there but my purchases are gone and there is no way in hell I'm paying for it again so a little help we be very appreciative. Edit: almost all my progress was saved some of my heros were at lower levels and some levels had lower stars.

game, Average, Average game for the series, unfortunately they used cheap gimmicks like 'white out' storms to make the map hard to see in later stage. It made it annoying, therefore difficult vs well thought out enemy groups and difficult. The latter is fun to overcome, the former is just trashy game design.

fan, Great, Great fan of the prequels of this game. Its alright but there was way too much expanse on the cinematics at the cost of truely good maps and towers. Its a mediocre kingdom rush with too much make up! Still exited to see some more, and hope its gonna be more in the style of the previous ones.

game, whole, This game was made impossible to beat so you are forced to get the in-app purchases. It sucks because I payed 5.99 for this game and it should be playable. Reply: The whole game from start to finish. Impossible to play. It's a free pay to win game that you deceivingly charged 5.99 for. Shame!!!!

game, great, I wasn't so willing to give 5 starts just because I got it with the game pass, but this game is, in all honesty, just a great TD game. The developers cared about this game and it shows. There is such depth to the gameplay and nothing is trying to get you to pay for anything once you have the game. This game is about the game, and not making money since I haven't been able to find a way to pay with actual money. Instead, the price reflects the effort put into it, if that all makes sense.

money, actual, I wasn't so willing to give 5 starts just because I got it with the game pass, but this game is, in all honesty, just a great TD game. The developers cared about this game and it shows. There is such depth to the gameplay and nothing is trying to get you to pay for anything once you have the game. This game is about the game, and not making money since I haven't been able to find a way to pay with actual money. Instead, the price reflects the effort put into it, if that all makes sense.
installment, Excellent, Excellent installment of the series, would be 5 stars if it didn't crash my phone when minimized.

torres, personalizable, Definitivamente un giro interesante al juego al controlar ahora a los villanos. Las nuevas mecánicas de control de torres y héroes lo hacen aún más dinámico y personalizable... Sin embargo, al remover niveles infinitos... una vez que terminas todos los niveles y consigues todos los logros, la rejugabilidad post-game decae demasiado.
series, Best, Best tower defense series
work, Great, Love this series! Great work on these games. Is definitely in the "Goldilocks zone" in terms of a challenge.
towers, many, Super lame that you pay for this game to have to pay more for some of the towers and heros. Why can't this be a pay once and done game? So many towers to choose from, seems like this could have been two separate games. Update: it is true you do not need to pay for any of the extra towers or heros to play the game. It's just annoying to know they are there but if you want to use them, you have to pay a high price for it.

game, Great, Great tower defence game!
levels, later, Its has glitches as you get to the later levels.
game, awesome, Been playing since the first. Still an awesome tower defense game. Although I'm seeing more and more monetary game mechanics. Hope the next game doesn't go in that direction

transactions, micro, Meh, micro transactions are too steep for the lack lustre gameplay. Don't download until it is free to download, because it is still loaded with in-app purchases that are pretty essential gameplay elements.

towers, certain, Just too difficult. Either you have to pay for certain towers (the most expensive hero maxed out isn't enough apparently) or there's just not enough room to play with strategies. No fun for me. Dying over and over just to find some overly specific way to do it at all got old.

game, Great, Great game from a great developer. I lucked out as this is part at my Play Pass subscription. Only problem so far is the occassional black screen, all that is required is to force close the game, and reload it. Progress has not been lost thus far. Good time killer, and very challenging waves.

game, designed, Well designed game. If you're a strategy tower defence fan this is a must have! Interesting characters, story delivered in comic book format and relentless anti-heroes combine into fun adventure. Abilities progress tree has no limit when resetting so it can be tailored to your play style. Graphics is pixelized, a common reoccurring retro trend, but this creation draws you in like Jumanji and can swallow you whole. Entertainment for all ages.

game, good, It's a good game and a perfect sequel to the first three games. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the overly-priced microtransactions in the game. Still really fun though.

days, few, This game is a lot of fun but I had to uninstall the game for a few days and when I reinstalled it I lost access to my heros I had bought with the bundle (wich is ×3 the price of the game itself) and had lost quite a bit of progress on missions I had completed the latter part isnt a that hige a deal as it gives me a excuse to replay those levels but losing out on payed content is rather aggravating. Okay update the support system worked and helped me get my lost content back the devs are good.

installation, good, A pretty good installation of the kingdom rush series with some nice art and music. The mechanics are similar to other installments in the series so it will be easy to pick up. I'm enjoying it so far

Physical game companies don't call on consecutive days asking for your time, or details. Change the dynamic please.

things, favorite, This game has been one of my favorite things in this series of games. the tower system is different but I love it it is a little pay walled but it's worth it . The levels feel easier on the easy difficulty and not overwhelming overall the game is a masterpiece . But The only problem I have is that there is no restore content button that you can use to get back the items you paid for.

game, Awesome, Awesome game. Buying towers and Champs is very expensive but the game is super playable without it
crystals, extra, Challenging, but fun. A lot of content is behind a pay wall, which initially was a bit of a turn off (since I already had to pay for this). However, it's definitely possible to clear all achievements without buying extra crystals/towers, etc - it just requires you to be more strategic (that's exactly what I was looking for). Overall, VERY good quality game that will provide days of enjoyment.

heroes, more, As much as I love the game, the paywall to get access to more heroes is too steep. Please add another grind mechanic so people who have already paid for the game can get access to more content.

towers, less, The weakest of the games that is also the most expensive. I get that the art is stepped up in this one, but unless you pay for inapp it feels like you get less towers than any other. This is because of the new way that the special towers work. You choose the 5 specialty towers you want before you go in the level. It's fun but I pretty much agree with all the other reviews critiquing the game.
