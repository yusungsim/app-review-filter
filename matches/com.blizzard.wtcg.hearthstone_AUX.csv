's, game, fun, it, it's a fun game. learning how to use all the systems in place makes it a lot more enjoyable as well. Oh and for people that complain that the company sales packs and boosters and such...welcome to virtually any ither TCG electronic or print card format. You can play for free and compete, solo campaigns for free, multiple game modes for free...I mean, God forbid the company be a For Profit company and have to pay their staff and such
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game. Downside is that there are constant updates and downloads.
be, money, most, This, Still unstable on mobile internet connections (3G or 4G). Won't run on two year old phones because of the Android version. Does run on PC with ADSL but the game turns out to be a total scam. This must be the most money hungry P2W cardgame available. Matches are rigged and they use an algorithm to make sure you stay on a 50/50 win rate. Packs bought with real money contain better cards compared to those bought with in game gold. Better stay away from any Activision game! Their greed has no limits
be, Garbage, passable, it, Honestly was looking forward to playing this on a tablet but it may be mildly passable game Garbage
's, game, fun, it, I would love to give it five stars because it's really fun game, but unfortunately it crashes all the time on Android. Hope they fix it someday
's, game, larger, it, Although it's a larger game gb wise it's fun with lots of play modes and the in game currency is plentiful enough you feel like you don't really need to spend money. Without hearthstone there probably would never have been mtga. Props for all the work put into this product.
's, app, good, It, It's a good app, however I'd add more time at the end of the battleground battle. Never have I ever had enough time to finish my round if it's only two of us fighting.
is, game, awesome, it, Great... Apparently update problem was not the games fault but rather my poor network.. back to 5 stars, because it really is a awesome game!!!!!! Try it if you don't believe me... And as far as everyone complaining that it's a pay to win game and everything.. try putting more time toward playing and advancing .. I believe it's quite far to all
is, love, awesome, This, This is a awesome game love to play it 100% worth play
's, fun, super, it, This game is great, been playing it for years and it's still super fun. I barely ever have connection issues and it's only usually in single player mode where I can just jump right back in at a later time. Everyone else is saying that they are getting disconnected every single game but I don't have any of those problems, just very few times. So it might not be blizzards fault so I recoend trying this game out and seeing if you enjoy it and if it'll work for you.
is, modes, friendly, that, great game that is new player friendly, different game modes and constant new additions don't let this game go stale

's, pay, much, It, It's too much pay to play for a free game. Battlegrounds isn't pay to play but duels, which already charges an entry fee DOES require you to pay for cards. When I finally copped out and paid about $40, the game got significantly more fun. Tl;dr overpriced pay to play but a fun game with free elements.
is, game, favorite, This, This is my favorite game. The only problem now is it costs wayyyyyy too much.
'm, customer, whale, I, Thousands of dollars. I'm a whale customer
is, thing, good, this, The game could be a whole lot better.. but it could be much, much worse too. Don't know if this is a good thing or not.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game but it is a bit laggy on most phones and sometimes it gives you an opponent that is a lot stronger than you and that you can't win if matchmaking was a bit better and if it was a bit less laggy it would be 5 stars
is, game, worst, This, This is the worst game in the world. A lot of bugs, i cannot play with my friends, because the button "play" does not work. Battlegrounds is the worst mode in this game. A lot of lags, ultimates cannot work properly, the random is the shittest.
's, game, live, that, Why does this app CONSTANTLY want to do small updates when I'm in the middle of a game and then disconnect me? It does it EVERY time I play. I'm not talking about actual patches, I'm talking about updates that take 5 seconds that should have run when I'm not in game. Highly annoying at this point. This happens no matter what network I'm on (I've tried 4) and happens in every single mode that's a live game against other players. Blizzard, you're decades old, get it together.
's, release, mobile, it, it's a fantastic card game, but I cannot stand the updates ... idk what it is with Hearthstone and updates... I am so annoyed by how frequently I have to wait 1hr+ on an update... and the game has single player modes.... so why do I have to be connected to the internet 24/7??? blizzard does not understand how mobile gaming works. I won't even mention the horrible port issues that remain unresolved since it's mobile release.
is, decks, same, it, This game is completely rigged. After a certain Rankin it is always the same decks and that only prove there is only one way to win. Always the same deck and strategies that can win. There is no originality and options to have fun when you rise above a certain rank.
is, game, same, This, I can't believe how disappointing this game has become!! I've been playing this game off and on for at least a decade now. This is not the same game it used to be. Absolutely terrible. Blizzard has ruined yet another game! They should be ashamed of themselves!
's, game, good, It, Used to play a lot. It's a good game for casual fun, but you really can't take it seriously. Forget about owning every card without spending couple hundred dollars every three months. Once you know what you're doing you'll win 4-6 out of 10 times. There are lots of interesting decks and combos to try, you'll get through them in a couple years IF you spend a couple thousand dollars. Otherwise enjoy what you can and don't take it seriously.
are, person, lucky, you, I love this game and have been playing for a very long time... like 5-6 years i think. This app however is terrible. It cost me so many attempts at getting legendary that i stopped playing ranked. Moved over to battleground. Now its constantly crashing and costing me rank there. If you play a session without it crashing you are a very lucky person. Terrible app that will cost you games constantly.
're, change, recent, they, The game has been asking me to write a review for a while now. I've held off for whatever reason but they're most recent change of adding this Diablo character to battlegrounds has completely ruined the experience for me. So one star good job
is, battle, impossible, this, Love the game, haven't had any issues until recently. I've been playing the story mode and I'm at the Malfurion vs Ragnaros part. I've played this battle over 50 times now with every strategy possible and haven't come close to beating him. This needs to be looked into because I believe this is an impossible battle to win. Thanks.
'm, player, new, I, Been playing for years. Unfortunately it is starting to crash lots, needs reinstall sometimes and looses connection often, even on a wired computer connection which makes it frustrating to enjoy Way too many unstable connections to make 20 minutes of game time with coffee not as relaxing as it used to be, glad I'm not a new player. I've stopped playing on other devices and uninstalled them. I don't mind a challenge but keep loosing progression due to game crashes and hang ups and waiting.. FFS
is, time, excellent, This, Hearthstone currently is some of the most fun it's been in years. This is an excellent time to join. update: nevermind this meta is awful
's, game, great, It, It's a great game fortunately every time you open it there's an update and upgrade every other day there's an upgrade it takes forever this time you have to uninstall the game just to reload it so I can update.
be, game, great, This, This could be a great game, if the word "random" actually ment random. Not the worst possible choice 8 out of 10 times.. Uninstalled this game after playing for a few years, it has lost it's touch.
is, game, good, it, Buggy and laggy throughout. If you want to play this game (and it is a good game), I suggest playing it on a computer, not a smartphone or tablet. Also, the newest update makes me unable to open the app, and there's no way to revert to an older version.
be, grind, long, it, Great game very addictive the later game is p2w it would be a very...very long grind to make a pack that's strong enough to compete with those that put some money into the game. Been trying to log in all day says there's a update that I need to download but its not showing in the play store, frustrating even more so with the reminder that the event will finish soon. Dropped to1 star until this is fixed and again, if the update isn't ready to be rolled out everywhere don't release everywhere.
is, he, free, it, Great overall, you don't need to pay to play I don't understand why people keep complaining about blizzard games, it is still a free he after all.
's, sink, huge, It, Game requires an update that is not available in the store yet. Just one of many annoyances that add up. An option to remove animations would be great, mobile is already laggy and buggy enough. It's a huge money sink, with too many half assed game modes.
is, game, great, this, While the main game requires a lot of effort (or money) to keep up with as new sets come out, battlegrounds is incredibly fun and full of strategy. As a whole, this is a great game.
's, game, great, it, Update: The android version has become so unstable it is barely playable now. Crashes and disconnects are a regular occurrence. I still think it's a great game, but this review is for the Android version and right now that has been ruined by bugs and instability. This game is great fun. The only downside has been how much of my free time it has sucked up.
is, game, fun, it, It's like Magic meets Pokemon but if you are a player not intending to spend ANY money then you will fall behind on being competitive. But it is a very fun and addictive game. UPDATE Still like I said from before lol. The RNG will piss you off if you get an extended unlucky streak. NEW UPDATE seems too hard for attracting new players due to the classic set cost but aside from that still awesome. NEW UPDATE can't play due to the update "not available" in the Play Store. Devs are ruining the game.
was, idea, bad, it, Demon seed was a great concept and still is but as a warlock main.. I must admit that it was a bad idea from the start. And their way of fixing it is making it a bad card in standard and banning it in wild. Its design choices like this that make the base game mode unplayable. Some cards are just flat-out broken while others are awful. The Battlegrounds and mercenarys modes are great but the base game is getting worse with every expansion.
's, smh, available, that, Everytime i go to play its a new update and its becoming annoying. 11/17/22 Why force a update that's not available, just stupid smh!
's, smh, stupid, that, Everytime i go to play its a new update and its becoming annoying. 11/17/22 Why force a update that's not available, just stupid smh!
's, game, awful, it, Used to be great years ago, but now it's an awful game run by probably the worst developer/publisher in the industry, and is extremely bloated and runs terribly. Really just not worth your time, try Gwent instead.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game .. but won't load or update anymore 🤬🤬🤬🤬 . It sucks for galaxy phones .
's, release, public, it, Been playing since it's public PC release in 2014 which was before ANY expansion, tavern brawl, battlegrounds, even ARENA wasn't out. It was just play mode and practice for the first couple weeks and I was HOOKED. The lore behind the heroes and cards got me interested in WoW more than I was when I actually played in 2012. So classic was a doozy. I've transitioned to Wild and have been summoning 4+ Juggernauts with the help of Brann, Dead Man's Hand and Taelon Fordring. Can't wait for FIAV!
is, option, best, this, After play some CCG's I have to say that HS is one of the most entertaining, but, its a game that relies only on luck, the levels of randomness are stupidly high, and thats its so frustrating, so if you want a game in which you want test your skills, this not the choice but if you want to test your luck this is the best option and the bad functionality in android and iPad's is absurd, I lost a lot of games for disconnections
be, use, worthwhile, it, This used to be a great game, however it crashes multiple times during a match, ensuring you cannot complete a game. Until it is fixed, I would recommend any other game as it will be a more worthwhile use of your time.
am, player, returning, I, Please Help...I am a returning hearthstone player I've played for a while...been about 2 years since I've been back and having trouble starting my account after making a $5 purchase please help. Thanks
'm, 4s, top, I, Amazingly diverse game in general but what really hooks me is BATTLEGROUNDS!!! Its phenomenal and it hooked me that much that I'm now 600 top 4s and 200+ wins and I'm going for a thousand!!!!!
are, business, huge, You, Fix your mobile game. Stop acting like an indie company that just started out. You are a huge business by you can't optimize a damn mobile client of your game. Oh but you can update the store with stupid "deals" twenty bucks for a single Merc card? Are you insane or just smoking meth up at HQ? Why would I pay you any money if you can't optimize a damn game. Top of the line and new phone too.
's, game, awesome, it, Please make this game offline too it's awesome game
is, app, only, this, A great game wrapped in a sucky app. The gameplay is really good. I can spend hours playing. Super cool. The app is like a n annoying child with internet separation anxiety. So many "disconnected" and "check your internet" errors that take forever to "reconnect". Sometimes it asks you to restart the app. I can assure you that this is not an issue with my phone or home internet, this is the only app that's giving me connection issues. Also what's with the manual updates? And why does it need 4gb?
is, game, best, This, This is the best game.
