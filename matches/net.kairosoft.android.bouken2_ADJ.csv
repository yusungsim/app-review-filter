twiddler, made, If you have played any game by this developer before you will know what to expect. It may not be fancy but it is a well made, relaxing, thumb twiddler of a game.
game, fun, Overall a fun town builder game. It would be perfect but there are just so many event popups in the game that it ruins the flow. Also the interface hasn't changed in years for games from this dev. I get it is their style but some ergonomic improvements would make their games A+.

years, several, I LOVE Kairosoft and have been supporting them for several years now. The games always make me happy and an easy way to kill time. They are simple to play with just enough challenge to either make you work a bit harder to achieve the rankings inside the game. Dungeon Village 2 is amazing!!! Adored the first one but this one gives you so much more from farming, monster tamers, outside visitors that you get from cart/balloon/ship, monstera to fight while still keeping original characters.

map, first, Played through the first map. Really like this game!

game, great, Honestly great game, made improvements to the original, logged in 20+ hours in just a week, think I'm addicted...
heroes, little, Really addicting. Just managing all your little heroes and the town customization is crazy... Only reason I rate it a 4 star and not a 5 is because I just wish it was a bit more challenging. maybe more battle types or something but I feel like there's something missing... Regardless it's a really good game. üëç

sim, robust, Very cute, and while maybe not the most robust sim I've played I really enjoyed the sprites and the overall feel of it. Only criticism is lack of sound design: hearing the same set of tons over and over can be a bit jarring.

game, actual, It plays like an actual game, like the ones that were played before pay to win was a thing. It's incredibly smooth and engaging.
weeks, few, So uhh... The game doesn't load for me. Not sure if it's my os or the game, but I've reinstalled 3 times, restarted my device a few, left the game for a few weeks, and nothing really seemed to work. GUI loads.. I think? Again I don't know because the game didn't load properly. Not really sure how to fix so help would be nice :)
play, more, It's fun. I am wondering how much more game play I'll get out of it, but it was worth my time.
system, fun, This game is amazing! What a fun system! I had a blast building and expanding my town. And it didn't ask me to review until I hit a 5star town rating, which was even better. No annoying "rate us!" all the time.
games, best, This is by far one of the best mobile games I've ever played. It brings so much joy to me to see all of the little things the developers put into this experience. So much content then what meets the eye. I will definitely try out other games from the same developer in the future. Thank you so much for an awesome game Kairosoft!

improvement, complete, really enjoyed the original and this is a complete improvement. glad to see kariosoft getting back to the one time purchases.
adventurers, more, Fun fantasy town sim/idle game. Place buildings and decorations to make youe town turn a profit and lure in more adventurers that you can eventually move in. Worth the price imo, as it avoids the pay to win/proceed scheme many similar free games use. As a bonus it only asked for the rating very far in gameplay wise so it didnt feel like an annoyance. If you like these types of games I highly recommend it.

variables, many, This game mixes so many different variables into a beautiful blend of gameplay. I love the city building aspect. Just watching your little adventurers walk around is fun. The only reason I rate for stars is like everyone else says, too many pop ups! They interrupt the gameplay so much because it freezes each pop up, and lemme tell you there are plenty lol. Other than that this game is the perfect grinding, crafting, building mobile game I've been looking for! Well worth the money, BUY IT!!

Hours worth of game play at your fingertips and honestly takes days to beat even playing non-stop, game honestly does well with its progression and honestly if you find it at all challenging push through as your second playthrough you'll whiz through it with ease, still takes days to beat and has replay value!!

charm, much, Ok, whoa. Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I have. The game doesn't ask you to rate it till youve reached a 5 star town, so I've already played quite a bit. And it's QUITE addicting. There's plenty of depth in the simplicity of all the systems. There is so much charm and polish. And near the end of the game where I'm at right now i feel very challenged and engaged. The game is good. 5 star. Thank You.

developer, best, Kairosoft is easily the best mobile developer out there. Their games strike this perfect balance of fun and engaging gameplay that's easy to learn but hard to master. I loved the first Dungeon Village and this game is very much the same but they turned everything up to 11... more jobs to learn, more streamlined gameplay, more depth to basically everything they did in the first game, and to top it off, they give you a bunch of new zones where you can take a handful of your best fighters to start a new town but with everything you've already unlocked. It's almost like a new game + but within the same save file. It really extends the longevity of the game considerably, and they still add tons of new things to unlock. I'm rather shocked by the depth of this game and how much value you get for your money. My only gripe might be that some of the animations for performing actions, like setting up a quest or handing out medals at the end of the year get kind of tedious and would be a lot nicer if you could unlock an option to speed them up or just turn some popups up altogether. Can't complain too much though. Get this game. It's damn near perfect.

But if you dont like conserving your money just right, or the strategy and luck involved, and if you dont mind resetting back a few in-game years of progress occasionally, its a great game.

progression, Enjoyable, Enjoyable, long progression however there is a lack of a speed-up button from the get go. There are many pockets of times where you simply have to sit with the application open or constantly have to press and hold to speed up dialogue or events. The save feature is the most frustrating-- you can lose many in game days of progress. If you decide to get this game, be sure to save in a spot you don't mind repeating the last few in game days.

game, interesting, Pretty interesting game! The interface could be improved. For example, the display of traits provided by events or items can only be seen one by one.
game, good, Pretty good game
grab, constant, Simple, fun, and addictive. Not a constant cash grab, either.
challenge, much, Generally good... But don't expect very much challenge. Great game for the younger crowd or relaxing casual players.

games, best, One of the best Kairosoft games. I was skeptical that a sequel to Dungeon Village could be better, because I loved the original, but this blows the first game out of the water. I can't stop playing it. Totally worth the buy-in; no microtransactions and it's an insanely deep and long-lived game.

friends, cool, Really like this game, you get to make it your own and build up your town and no in app purchases or ads. Also you get cool monster friends along the way!
rpg, idle, Fun town sim game and idle rpg.
idea, Great, Very fun. Great idea for a game genre
game, Excellent, Excellent game. I've seen reviews that say it's too hard, but I disagree. You just have to keep up with upgrading your villagers' equipment and such, and you'll do fine.
games, favorite, One of my favorite games from one of my favorite developers!

one, 1st, Hooked much more to do than the 1st one
way, entertaining, As always, Kairosoft delivers. Totally addictive in the most entertaining way. It also really prolongs the story much better than the original Dungeon Village.
rating, high, I truly don't get the high rating if this game, this one is so dull I can't believe I paid for it! It feels like an idle game to me, not my thing.

popups, less, Really fun offline game. I wish that the UI used less popups as it can get a little busy, but overall its a great game! I've gotten to 5 stars on the first town and am now moving on to the next one, I'm glad there's a progression to the game. Worth the $ too, as theres no ads and the gameplay is smooth.

tutorial, confusing, Very confusing, very short tutorial and practically no documentation. It's also slow to load and auto save is unreliable and sometimes you lose 10-15 minutes of progress. Waste of money, and I've liked other Kiarosoft games.

town, 3rd, Addictive, but you can sit it down and enjoy life. You're competing with yourself, so there's no rush. I'm on the 3rd town, with 5* across so far. Very casual and fun. I enjoy just letting it run and watching them grind. Looking forward to DV3 or added content here.

company, same, Really cute! I enjoyed this a lot. Definitely going to try more from the same company.
lot, available, Interesting take on the tycoon type game style. It's sucked me in, even though i don't usually get into these games too easily. It's just one of those games that's really well made, but doesn't have a lot of info readily available online, so doing well in the game is entirely up to you.
stakes, real, Fun way to waste time. No losing, no real stakes, just manage your little dungeon village and have fun.

game, Super, I've had a blast with the game. Super clean game. Worth buying for sure. Beats p2w any day. Plus, for as cheap as the game is, you'll get way more for your money in this game than anything else.

upgrades, unique, I wish they would add unique upgrades to buildings, or the old tile combo system. Perhaps 2 buildings of the same type becoming an upgraded version. The items feel a little excessive and the population popup gets annoying, population doesn't have any value than upgrade requirements. Perhaps farmland needs a buff. Also the second town expansion should come a bit earlier, I was sitting with a cramped town for a long time. The titles are nice, wish they had more purpose like a merging system.

town, first, Really fun, been binge playing it. Got my first town to five stars and working on the second. Monsters have really silly and playful dialog and it is micromanage heaven. No p2w, p2c, or anything pay related except begging villagers for gold and buying the game itself.

If intentional, this is bad game design, as there is no telegraphing of this and you get punished for not being able to beat him. If not, this is still bad game design as he is too hard to defeat in any reasonable way, being able to wipe you even if you send literally everything you have.

maps, different, This game was and is so addicting and I can play forever with different maps and worlds and ppl I don't think it ever stops but it's very fulfilling And fun and lots and lots of equipment and items and things to unlock. When you think you beat the game, you are maybe only 1 percent done
minutes, several, The app takes several minutes to start.
game, fun, It's a fun game. No microtransactions or ads in it. Easy to pick up town builder that seems to have a lot of depth.

village, first, Gets repetitive and boring real fast. After the first village most of your playtime is repeatedly clicking through 5 window pop-ups.
one, best, Love this game but, I've seen other's comment on how to improve this game and I kinda agreed with it. Maybe do it for the dungeon village 3 in case you guys gonna make it (please make it, dungeon village series is the best one you got for now)... Also, the most importantly, make a button of "buy all" or select the number of things we wanna buy in store, it's annoying to buy it one by one...
game, fun, Very fun game!
cost, small, Fun game, no in game purchases, no pay to win. Worth the small cost, and super cute!
day, first, To be honest, I thought I'd get bored and drop it within the first day. But the end, it was enough to draw me in and satiate. I just cleared the five star mark and will probably stop now, but what it does give you isn't bad for what it is.

game, great, A chill and great game. I just don't like the repetitive in-game notifications; some can't eveb be sped up by tapping the screen. Over-all, I still love this game.

time, fun, Really fun time playing this game chill way to pass the time
day, first, Fun the first day, but then gets very repetitive and boring. Too many pop ups all the time. One of the characters got stuck in the middle of the road and couldnt move for the rest of the game. Also, if you switch to another app and switch back, you'll get a black screen and have to restart your game without being able to save.

transactions, micro, This game is honestly addicting. No micro transactions no BS. Just play the game with the mechanics the devs designed. Love this game.
bucks, Decent, Decent 8 bucks
game, Great, Great game!
game, easy, Really easy game compared to dungeon village 1. Haven't mastered half the jobs yet and beat the game. It's fun. Try it out.
atmosphere, relaxed, Fun game with a relaxed atmosphere aside from the ingame prompts popping up all the time.
game, fun, Very fun game! I love that for just a few dollars you can have constant play. And you can just keep growing!

game, entertaining, It's a fairly entertaining game to keep you occupied but it would be nice if you could skip the pop ups for when the quests appear and whatnot since the game pauses
time, much, Spent so much time playing this! Definitely worth ago! Hope.we get more of the dungeon type games!
game, new, I love all kairosoft games and this was no exception. It's a lot of fun to play, has tons of content and I even look forward to starting a new game and playing again.
game, addictive, This an extremely addictive game. Fun, simple and interesting. If you're bored give this game a try.
experience, bad, I was convinced that this was going to be a bad experience because my town was always in debt but it quickly became a game I simply couldn't put down. It continuously became more and more enjoyable. With no cash shop! Absolutely amazing experience. Would love to see some quality of life with the town management ECT. And some better menu navigation would make this a very chill game.

game, first, Enjoyed the first game and this one built upon that success. Quite enjoyable as all Kairosoft games have been that I've played
playground, statistical, This game is extremely fun and a statistical playground for players.
game, great, Overall a great game and I'm loving it. I would say sometimes you get stuck in the notificafion/animation loops for what feels like days. Hope they add a feature to skip or supress some of it. Seeing the same message 500 times in two hours gets old. maybe move some of them to a mailbox system or add an option to skip join animations, maybe checkmarks to assign medals and the like.

game, Good, Good game
version, first, They ask you to write a review after you've finished a gameplay cycle. It's fun, they've added a lot of content since the first version, which I also enjoyed. Definitely worth the price if you have a few people in your play family to share it with.

one, second, I played the first one a lot and i was really excited to see that a second one was being developed. This game beats out the first in terms of content and replayability, this was definetly worth the few bucks.

one, 2nd, Dungeon Village was my first Kairosoft app, and I'm so happy to see a 2nd one has come out! Immediately purchased without a second thought, and haven't regretted it yet. Looks like Kairosoft is stepping away from the F2P zone, which I definitely support.

game, Great, Great game, wish it was longer
parts, best, Builds off the best parts of the first installment. It guess much deeper and incentivizes to post much longer than the first with more quests and slower boss reveals.

price, low, Fun and worth the low price. The only complaint I have is the AI needs a bit of work, since physical characters will sometimes replace a good weapon they have with a magic boosting weapon, and vice versa.

game, proper, No ads, pay to win, or gambling mechanics. It is designed like a proper game. Progression is fun and you can develop a connection to individual characters. I did not give a 5-star for the following reasons: - Too many notifications! This has been said by other reviewers and I have to agree 100% Please listen and set most to just be the pop-up ones across the bottom. Some things notify you 3 times and its tiring when the game freezes every few seconds with information you have read 100s of times since the first year. - Menu organization. Facilities organization doesn't make sense there are stores under all categories. Under adventure, quests are the only adventure option the other presents and monsters should be an adventurer tab. There are so many other things on this but that was just a few of them. Just a few other points for Dungeon Village 3. Please make unique attributes for each adventurer. Make adventurers randomly generated and allow them to die if they aren't recovered from the field for a hardcore mode. Change the map for easy monsters close to town and harder monsters further away and make lairs stay on the map and replenish over time. Great working title keep it up!

This has been said by other reviewers and I have to agree 100% Please listen and set most to just be the pop-up ones across the bottom. Some things notify you 3 times and its tiring when the game freezes every few seconds with information you have read 100s of times since the first year. - Menu organization. Facilities organization doesn't make sense there are stores under all categories. Under adventure, quests are the only adventure option the other presents and monsters should be an adventurer tab. There are so many other things on this but that was just a few of them. Just a few other points for Dungeon Village 3. Please make unique attributes for each adventurer. Make adventurers randomly generated and allow them to die if they aren't recovered from the field for a hardcore mode. Change the map for easy monsters close to town and harder monsters further away and make lairs stay on the map and replenish over time. Great working title keep it up!

killer, Amazing, Amazing time killer, if you're a big fan of simulation games, I highly recommend this one. Kairosoft has been a long time favorite of mine...from Game Dev to Oh! Edo, this revisit to Dungeon Village is no disappointment! 5 stars, hands down.

fun, more, Addicting, but no ads to be invasive. I'm having more fun with the $7 game right now then the $20 one I bought on pc
additions, new, Appreciate the game for what it is, but it is a bit copy paste. Lots of new additions and goal posts to make it a little less monotnous. Overall a strong 4~4.5
transactions, micro, This game is amazing if you don't want to put it down you really don't have to and there is no micro transactions truly amazing
ways, many, Just hit town raiting of 5stars, there is so many different ways this game can be played. I love all the cute little characters and different types of buildings you can make. I'm having an absolute blast playing this game!

monsters, pet, Fantastic, i love how my adventures can get pet monsters and theres replay-ability. Once one town is maxed out, you can make a new town to expand your territory. I love it so much. Well worth the money i paid for it.

games, few, I've played a few Kairosoft games, but this is one has been my favorite so far. Plenty of content for such a cheap price, and no microtransactions. Just a fun way to waste time on your phone.

upgrade, huge, After quite some time of not keeping myself up to date on kairosoft games i still bought this without hesitation. 1. Because kairosoft. 2. Dungeon village part 2! This is such a huge upgrade from the first one. Tons of gameplay! It has different maps to explore while still keeping your progress. Jobs facilities adventurers still remain while there's new ones unlock on the next map. Overall it's another good one from kairosoft. Now I'm hoping to see Ninja Village 2!

game, fantastic, Awesome sequel to an already fantastic game.
sink, total, Beware: it's a total time sink.
game, fun, This is a fun, interactive game to play when you get some downtime. It pauses when you leave the game so you always start off where you left things. I love how you can customize your town and the people living in it!

game, first, I've played the first game years ago. This one is a major improvement and does not disappoint. New equipment, more facilities, more customization, and more characters. Kairosoft never fails to deliver good quality games.

stress, much, Kairosoft are so good at strategy mobile games. This is another one that has me hooked! I was only disappointed to see the end game material operates slightly differently, however, it's a game that can be played for hours without too much stress or strain!
version, first, I loved this game as much as the first version. The reason I didn't give 5* is because there is an excessive amount of in-game notifications/messages that pop up. Seems like every 10 seconds a congratulations would come up on screen for a mundane task. I'd recommend for the developers to reduce these so you can actually play the game

games, little, I have always loved Kairosoft's little rpg management games. There's always so much to do, classes and places to explore, and you can lose yourself in them for hours. They were starting to head to the horrible freemium/wi-fi connection format so many use, but thankfully it looks like they have abandoned the abomination of a platform. Stay awesome Kairosoft. I'll happily buy these little gems you make for $6-7 a pop.

one, first, The first one was the best of these fantasy village Sims for mobile. This one has everything great about the first one and more. Hail to the king baby!
phone, modern, Legit takes over 3 minutes to load. Not exaggerating. I'm on a modern phone, no other games have trouble running. Suspicious to say the least. Feels like it's data mining your phone each time.

games, mobile, Honestly the games really good if you need something to pass time. I really don't like playing mobile games but when the computer is just not available this is pretty dang good ngl. Yea pop ups are a thing(NOT ADS BTW) but they aren't that big of a deal at all. 8 hours in and I know I'm gunna keep playing. Until I get my computer back at least.

ups, pop, I have enjoyed playing this game, but if you don't like games that constantly make pop ups then you might not find it as enjoyable. Here's an example of what I mean provided you have a monster tamer : new dungeon, completed dungeon, [monster name] wants to join you, get a metal, [monster name] wants revenge, a new monster has appeared, [adventurer] want a house, [adventurer] house completed, and you have to deal with this every 30 seconds or so. Over all I have enjoyed playing this game.

town, first, I loved the first one. If you played it then you have to play this one. It has everything I loved about the first one but a million more things. A lot of people commented on on the number of pop up in game. There are a lot but that means you're doing well. The pop ups are tell you things that are going on. And there's alot going on. I just got my first 5 star town. If you've ever played a game like this and liked it then you'll love this game. It's worth every penny
town, third, I am thoroughly addicted to this game. I'm on my third town, and I won't stop until the game stops.

game, Solid, Solid game, worth the rating even though it asks for a 5* review for an in-game reward. I'm giving it 5* anyway. Builds off everything that made the first one addictively fun, with more to do and build. Lots of pop-up notifications as you play, far more than the first, so be prepared for that. The addition of more worlds is a great touch!

Lots, more, Solid game, worth the rating even though it asks for a 5* review for an in-game reward. I'm giving it 5* anyway.

time, nice, Fun game nice time killer
improvement, great, A great improvement over the original, can lose days playing this.
game, Cute, Cute and surprisingly detailed game. Always liked their games.
game, fun, It's a fun time sync game. It's worth the 7 bucks I paid.
games, old, It was ok, good to remind old Kairo games.
game, good, This is a good game, but it needs tweaking to be a great mobile game. Less popups, improved GUI etc. However it is fun and enjoyable, in fact it was to quick to beat. The popups are too much need to be handled better. I would like to see a PC port, with longer game play; like stardew Valley and a longer more casual version for mobile. Game is designed well and has good mechanics, perfect for fun, just do not expect to put your phone down.

entry, great, A Return to Form for Kairosoft! Really great entry in the Kairosoft franchise. I'm loving the game and only just finished the first town. I don't really understand the complaints about the frequent pop-ups. It's a little annoying, but you can quickly click through them. Typical for a Kairo game. Great work overall.

sprites, adorable, Just like the first, Dungeon Village yet again has blown it out if the water, with adorable sprites and animations, and a surprisingly in-depth village-dungeoneering mechanic, this game will have you instantly hooked. Naming the heroes is pretty fun too, helps to identify high level heroes.

options, different, The game is very engaging with a lot of different class options to work with. I personally like the monster companion engine. It's always nice to put a draggi with a summoner.

things, several, I forgot sleeping for a night playing this game. I find it is challenging when the town reach 3 stars and above. Each year passes very quick and there are several things to plan and invest. I find this game is much relax since it no require combo, which sometime it really time consuming rather than just enjoy the game.
game, Exact, Exact same game play as the 1st game, but has tons more features including starting multiple towns.

complaint, common, Popup advice: remove the town point pop-ups and reward those points autonomously. The common complaint is that there are too many popups. This specific popup isn't needed. There's already a notification displayed for town point milestones. Removing these should fix the too many popups complaint in my opinion.

jobs, multiple, Simply phenomenal! This game brings a lot to the table and I have only just begun! Love the way each character can do multiple jobs and become stronger and stronger! I am still trying to figure out how to make my income positive instead of being in deficit most of the times, but I guess that's one of the beauty of the game: You are free to do as you wish! Build, destroy, rearrange and go out there and kill some monsters and raid some dungeons!

details, many, Totally worth the money. They add so many small details, if you've played their earlier games, you'll see the improvements on this one. I've always been a Kairosoft fan so definitely gonna be waiting on the next game with just as much, if not more, details on customization with the houses, characters, monsters and placement of things.

intervals, longer, Fun gameplay, but the popups from in-game events turn me off from playing the game in longer intervals.
sequel, Fantastic, Fantastic sequel to DV1! The new tamable monsters, multiple towns, traits, jobs and cauldron upgrades are great! My only minus is the amount of "pop-ups" you get, especially after gifting lots of things to an adventurer. But its not bad enough for me personally, so still rating it 5*! Huge fan of Kairosoft games, played them all several times!

content, excited, This is NOT a sequel to dungeon village, it's a remaster if the original. I loved the original and was excited new content but the first hour or so are almost identical. Exact same shops, minimal change to mechanics, even the items haven't changed. For those new to the franchise, definitely go for it, but if you wanted a different game to the original keep your money.

fan, huge, I've always been a huge fan of Ksoft games. I loved dungeon village 1 and really like Dv2 thanks for a good game at a rationale price

way, great, I have had a blast with this game! I didn't expect it to have the level of depth that it does. It's a great way to unwind after work.
bucks, few, Well worth the few bucks to buy. Got five star village by the end of my second day playing, and think it would be fun to play it again. I see the validity of the complaints about pop-ups. One thing I would suggest is on the pop-up, add a small button to take you to the settings where you can choose to speed up the pop-ups and mute the sound on it.

game, same, It's the same game! $7 for a 2 at the end of the title. Loved the first one but I don't see how it's different from the first.
games, last, This is worth the money. I have enjoyed this companies games over the years. The last few games left me unsatisfied, but this game feels like they have gone back to the magic that makes games amazing.

builder, good, This game is a very good town builder and sim, it's easy to follow and has a wide variety of objectives to complete. Only just 5 starred the first town, still have to checkout the next. Worth the price for the number of hours spent in it.
