's, state, current, it, I own this game on steam as well and it is great but the port is very mediocre. There are tons of issues with the user interface. It makes it very awkward to play and you are constantly making moves or choices you don't intend to. With hope they eventually fix it but as far as I'm concerned it on is a waste of $10 in it's current state
am, ðŸ˜’, frustrated, I, I love the game, but I am often stuck for minutes on the "syncing" screen. Considering the fact that I only ever play on one device and don't need this feature, I am rather frustrated ðŸ˜’ It would be nice if this feature could be either disabled, made to work in the background or simply run faster..
's, game, based, it, Wonderful turn based strategy rogue-like (yes it's a luck based thinking game). Great mobile release. Worth the price, replayability is high. There are at least over a dozen knockoffs of this game out there, but this is the one that started it all. None of the knockoff games capture quite the same balance in the cards and relics interactions. Would recommend!
is, game, good, It, It is a really good game just wish they updated it with more content with new champions, new enemies, new cards or new modes. There not really anything to keep you playing this game same stuff different run.
's, port, great, It, It's a great port, however, I currently have an issue where the game force closes every time upon reaching the "Victory?" screen. I still see it for a second, then the game force closes. This happened twice now, and when I go back to check if the run was saved, it wasn't. This means that I can't win. Please resolve this. Thanks!
is, port, sloppy, this, The original game is great, but this is a sloppy port. Card selection is sticky, so it's easy to select a card you didn't intend, and all the dialogs are clearly designed with a mouse in mind
is, game, favorite, This, This is my favorite game. Nice port over too.
's, game, great, It, Tried playing the game, but it just doesn't work on the Chromebook. Try creating a file, place the name, and the game just stops. It's a great game that I've played on PC platforms, but I guess the game isn't compatible for Chromebooks at this time. What a shame.
be, card, nice, that, It's fun. I am on ascension 10 with the silent, and am still missing 3 cards, all of which are locked. Says there's no unlocks for the silent left. Really disappointing, one of the cards is a catalyst, which triples enemy poison. I feel like that would be such a nice card to pick up but I guess I will never know until this bug is fixed.
's, fun, much, It, It's so much fun that I had to uninstal it before my wife divorces me.
's, game, full, it, Amazing , text could be a bit larger but it's the full game
's, port, faithful, it, The card selection and online sync is wonky at times, but apart from that it's a faithful port. Mod support would be awesome.
's, port, good, it, There are some slight issues with card selection when you have a massive hand, but I imagine it's less problematic if playing on a tablet due to more screen size. Overall, I'd say it's a really good port, my biggest issue is properly selecting things on the top bar, but that could be due to my fat fingers. Pro tip, if you're trying to deselect a card, drag it down to one of the bottom corners of the screen, this will take the "cursor" off of the cards and nothing will be selected.
is, purchase, third, This, This is my third purchase of STS, so I knew what I was getting in to. Game is great, and touch controls work fine, but (on my phone at least) there are a few fiddly bits, like selecting a potion or trying to view your deck from the small icon at the top of the screen
's, thing, frustrating, It, I really like the game but have had multiple times that my run is completely erased after hours of play even after I manually save and quit. It's the most frustrating thing and would like a complete refund.
's, port, bad, it, So off the bat it's not a bad port the core game is there a tad expensive for a phone ap, custom options are a little gutted the problems with the game are. -Game doesn't always save your run -You can press continue only so many times(3-4max) before it deletes your save Selecting cards us very annoying as it will legit close the game on new devices since it's low your phone will think you did a swipe to close. -the game randomly kicks you out of the run sometimes and doesn't save your progress
's, game, good, it, Few bugs but it's still good game overall
is, game, amazing, This, This is just an amazing game. If you can get past the clunky... And I mean CLUNKY controls, this game is soooooo worth it. Seriously, please figure out an easy way to deselect cards in battle. It's just annoying when it starts to deselect and then goes, "Ha! I tricked you!" And reselcts itself... Sometimes tapping on a different card will even cause the currently selected card to cast itself. Game is a solid 6/5, UI/UX in battle 2/5...
's, Roguelike, based, It, Awesome game! I've got almost 100 hours on PC and mobile, sand I definitely recommend you picking this gem up. It's a great single player PvE card based Roguelike, with tons of content. Every character can be played in lots of ways, which makes the experience even better. All this port could use is a bit more polish. Notably, in the Lagavulin fight, the health bar glitches out and gets too wide. But besides some graphical stuff, and occasional crashing, this is a solid game, I recommend it!

's, process, long, it, One of my favorite games of all time. Can easily play it for hundreds or thousands of hours. Can feel unfairly difficult, but it's just a very long learning process.
is, shame, complete, This, Awful UI and UX on Android. This is a complete shame as I love Slay the Spire on Xbox and PC and wanted to really enjoy it here. Unfortunately UI just killed it for me.
's, game, best, It, It's the best game
's, port, solid, It, It's a pretty solid port. Everything's there: the music, the graphics, the insane card combos, it's great. I only have two problems. 1) choosing what card to play and who I want to target is surprisingly tricky. By no means impossible, but it can be annoying at times. 2) every time you die (and you die a lot, it is a roguelike), the game freezes for upwards of 30 seconds.
is, port, great, this, Slay the Spire is a fantastic game, and this is generally a great port. The only major issue I have is that on winning or losing a run, the app freezes for a while, presumably because it's submitting the run to cloud servers. It'd be nice to either have a way to turn cloud saves off, or to submit the runs asynchronously without blocking the main game. Still a very (re)playable and enjoyable game, will update review if that issue gets fixed.
's, experience, good, it, Card descriptions are cut off on Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. I love this game on the switch, but it's not a good experience for me on mobile
be, game, perfect, this, Slay the spire is an incredible game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes deckbuilders, roguelikes, or really just anyone who likes good games. This implementation is mostly fine with exactly one flaw - tapping on and casting cards is very clunky. Somethng about the touch detection is off. With a simple fix this would be a perfect game, but right now it's a big enough flaw that I need to dock a star. Please fix clicking on cards in your hand.

is, port, miserable, This, This game is incredible but the performance on phones is atrocious. More than half the time it crashes before I even get to the main menu because of "Data Syncing" failures. If you want to play this I'd recommend any other platform. This is a miserable port, not worth the money at all.
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game on all platforms but for the love of God fix it from crashing on start up and death scenes. It used to not be like this and I don't know why it's so prominent now.
's, game, fantastic, it, Great game. Great replay value, addictive too. Only con is the touch control can be off a little. I play it and the Nintendo switch too and it's better there. But overall it's still a fantastic game on Android, highly recommended.
's, game, same, it, one of the best roguelikes ever is on mobile. granted this port is among the worst ways to play the game, but it's still the same game. better than basically any other app as far as depth of strategy for a roguelike goes.
's, game, great, It, Runs still disappearing frequently which is very frustrating to say the least. It's a great game though
was, buy, instant, it, I bought that game on steam when it came out .... When I saw it on the play store it was an instant buy that game is an 11/10
is, time, third, This, Honestly one of the best games ever made, I comeback to it again and again. This is my third time buying it and I'm just as happy doing so as the last two times. My only regret is the effect having it on my phone will have on my sleep and productivity. Also this time around has really made me realize how well balanced this game is, as I have beaten it once in all 3 characters and defeated the heart as the silent before I was even max level on any character! Really lets me know how far I've come
's, Edit, related, it, Pixel 4. Still unable to play, paid in full. Open the game. Full black screen, 30 seconds later it closes itself. Remove and redownload daily to get the latest.... but it's just not working. Sent reports in and the only response was "patches incoming" but not aknowldegemnt it's phone related Edit. Months later.... Still unopenable....... And when I contacted to get a refund I got a run around from both the company and the play store. Completely unexaptable....
is, game, good, this, While this is a good game the mobile experience is pretty awful. It's not optimized for mobile at all, often times selecting wrong cards. It also has a problem with just losing your in progress run. Pretty disappointing, hopefully this will get fixed
's, amount, insane, That, One of the actual best games I've ever played and it's on my phone (?!). I had over 600 hours with this on the Switch and now have a similar amount on Android. That's an insane amount of quality, engaging, varied gameplay for such a small amount. Megacrit have created the definitive deckbuilding roguelike here. It simply cannot be beaten (literally if you're playing for a heart kill at A20 with the Silent).
's, game, good, It, It's such a good game, but such a bad port.
is, shame, real, which, It's always a gamble whether the app will crash before it opens past loading page, or it will take five minutes to finish syncing data and then load, which is a real shame because I love the web version of this. Please fix it.
's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game, I'd say the gameplay works even better for quick mobile sessions than on PC. One big problem though is that your progress is deleted sometimes when you save & quit. That kills all the fun, especially if you had a good run and lose all your progress. With better saving options it would be 5 stars! Update: Downgrading my rating. It's just no fun when you had a great run and the game didn't save it. Also apparently Run History doesn't sync across devices.
is, deal, huge, This, Fantastic game I've put many hours into on PC. This mobile port isn't great, but it's not terrible. It isn't unoften that I play a wrong card or choose a wrong item from inaccurate controls. The game also sometimes forgets saved data, erasing current runs. This is not a huge deal but worth mentioning: the loading time when you open the game (syncing data) takes a long time. Besides these things, I am still happy to be able to play conveniently on the go. :)
is, game, great, this, It's a bit clunky on mobile but my gosh is this a great game
is, game, exact, This, This is a port of an incredible PC game. The PC game is my favorite roguelike, hands down. This is the exact same game. That makes this a fantastic game worth the money. Sadly, it's a direct port. The UI is phone-unfriendly and works poorly. The game is still 10/10, but the controls are awful. You'll get used to it, but it's a shame nonetheless.

's, complaint, only, That, After reading reviews I was really doubting to buy this game. But I did it and don't regret it. Haven't had any problems with data synchronization. Controls are okay, but not 100% accurate, and that's the reason I give it 4 stars. When you try to look at a card, they kind of pop out a bit and stay there. And when you try to drag another card to play, you might accidentally play the one you looked at. That's my only complaint, otherwise great game.
is, game, played, this, I have to edit my review ðŸ˜“. I had 5 stars because this is my most played game on PC. I've been playing it almost daily since release. Then.. the syncing issues started. Sometimes I want to just hop into a quick game, but I have to sit at the main screen waiting for sync. Finally done syncing. I play 30 minutes, beat a boss or two. Come back an hour later and boot my game up.. waiting for sync.. ok.. I'm back in the first act. Please fix this. Reducing stars every time I lose progress. This sad.
is, game, fun, This, This is a fun game and is enjoyable. However, it would be far better if it didn't crash every time I die... Not to mention I lose progress when I load the game back up and try to continue the quest. I wouldnt be upset had I not paid $10 for this game, If it were free I could uninstall and move on. I'd really like a refund but I'm sure that will never happen.
's, port, good, It, This game is clearly a 5/5, and I've sunk hundreds of hours into it on PC and mobile, but I have to dock a star for the Android port. It's just not a good port; it doesn't handle well, there are several bugs and glitches that can easily frustrate you or cause you to play the wrong card, and the "Syncing data" message is leading to absurdly long load times. It's still the best game on the Play Store.

's, content, same, It, Very nice game played it already on PC. It's the same content but the port is not the best.
's, issue, only, it, I absolutely adore this game. I've played a couple hundred hours on my computer, and finally had to buy it for mobile so that I could play on the go. There is one slight issue, though: when I switch to another app to do something else (check emails, turn on Spotify, etc.) it will occasionally totally forget the current run. There's no longer a continue prompt, and the run isn't in the run history. I'm unsure if this is an issue with the game or my phone, but it's the only issue I've experiened
's, UI, same, it, Fantastic game, but garbage Android app. For fans considering getting the game to play on their phone, I recommend using steamlink instead. Reasons the Android app sucks: (1) Insanely slow load. (2) Extreme battery usage. (3) Poor syncing issues--be prepared to lose entire runs. (4) Almost no UI changes. No, I'm not kidding--it's the same game UI as designed for a large, desktop screen just shrunk down on a phone. Trying to click the options menu without hitting deck or map is pretty freaking hard. Also, in some scenarios, like when you have a full hand, you CAN"T target your left-most card when target-card-in-hand effects play (like choose a card to discard). So, you know, the game is 5 stars, the app is 2 at best.
's, game, great, it, I would love to give this game 5 stars, it's a great game. But recently it has become literally unplayable with Google Play Games popups preventing me from using the app at all
is, port, awful, this, The cloud syncing is just a nightmare. It has been deleting my saves since the first time I bought this game. PC version is the way to go, this is just an awful port.
is, port, solid, This, This is a very solid port of a particularly addictive game. I wish I had not bought it for this very reason.. Very good for idle time at work, can pick back up anytime!
's, roguelike, best, It, It's the best deck building roguelike. Wanting more is plain unreasonable!
are, ones, major, These, Slay the Spire is one of my favorite games of all time. That said the port has some issues. These are the major ones. 1. The app 'losing' runs when you close midgame and randomly finding them again several games later 2. The app occasionally not recognizing when you beat an Ascension level. This has happened to me at least 3 times, including my first time beating Asc 19, which was very frustrating. 3. it is very difficult to deselect cards or potions if you decide you no longer wish to use them
is, game, amazing, this, Finished my first run and the game crashed and lost my run. It doesn't even show up in my run history. Poorly optimized which is unfortunate cause this is an amazing game.
is, stuff, basic, this, Even with all sound and music muted, plays incredibly loud opening music when loaded up. Not to mention the frequent freezing after a win that other reviews have mentioned. Come on guys, this is basic stuff.
is, downside, only, that, Great game, with good gameplay at the core. However, the port works in strange ways and makes it far from intuitive to plsy your cards, that is my only downside.
's, fault, more, that, One of the very few Android games that don't suck, probably because it wasn't originally developed for Android. It is a little annoying that I can't preview my deck on my Pixel 4a due to the stupid camera hole punch though. But that's more Google's fault.
is, game, entertaining, This, Reviews are too harsh on this title. This is hands-down the most entertaining mobile game I've played and deserves far more recognition. Nothing else has kept my attention for hours. It has some annoying quirks in the control scheme - card deselection is particularly painful. Why not tap to select/deselect, and drag to use? A very faithful port that could do with some tweaking.

A very faithful port that could do with some tweaking.
is, release, recent, this, Twice that I have won now, the game has neglected to save my progress. And this is not a very recent release either, so I doubt that they will try to do anything about this.
is, crash, rare, This, Four stars because of one specific problem. I've had the game freeze upon winning multiple times, usually after seeing your damage to the heart but before unlocks/breakdown of your score. It also just deletes your run. Normally you can just restart the game and continue where you left off but instead (since the run is "over") you lose an hour of time and don't get the win. This is not a rare crash. Small sample size but I'd say 1/4 wins will crash and not get credited. Pretty lame
are, waste, complete, Some, With any card game there is rng and luck involved. This one is no different. You can build a great deck from advancing just to get to the boss and be completely I'll equipped to deal with it. Some of the cards are just a complete waste to pick up and often you will do runs where you get to the boss and only have one additional card to your starting attacks and defense. That simply isn't powerful enough to defeat a boss or sometimes even an elite. Addicting though..
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but so frustrating to play on mobile. You can't even see the damage values of the cards without selecting it. It's so easy to misplay a card with the touc controls and de-selecting seems more difficult than it should be. It's too bad it's so frustrating to play as I have spend hundreds of hours on this game on PC.
's, states, save, it, I love the game on PC and you definitely get the same joy on mobile but there are some frustrating issues with the app. Every time you start the app it needs to sync for an unreasonable amount of time. If it's just some save states it really can't be taking that long. At least on my phone it's very difficult to deselect the active card potentially leading to game losses by playing a card you didn't want to play. Maybe there is a way I didn't figure out yet
is, game, great, this, The port for touch devices is not very good, but is playable. Other than that, this is a great game as the internet already knoes.
is, loop, unplayable, It, Game keeps crashing and reseting a run when I win or die. It is an unplayable time loop of a port. Support told me they couldn't do anything. Waste of my time, waste of my money, buy it on Steam instead and save yourselves some grief.
is, game, perfect, This, Amazing if not for the bad controls. This is conceptually the perfect phone game. It is great. The only issue is the user interface wasn't rebuilt to work with touch. Accidentally opening menus, choosing cards you didn't intend to, and tapping stuff that won't work because your other hand is brushing the screen are common and frustrating issues. Devs, go play a few rounds of hearthstone on mobile and straight copy that feel. Otherwise your great game is just meh. 3 rounds lost to bad UI.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but have to much bugs and it's slow. The one bug i can't stand is when you clear a ascension run but it dosen't save/register that you beat it.
is, buggie, little, It, Love this game! It is a little buggie though, it doesn't save all the time.
be, stars, easy, this, Great game, the problem is the app is terrible. Never played it on pc nad I still have fun, but many things are making my experience way worse. When I abandon, the game crashes 70% percent of the time. Sometimes, the game randomly goes to somewhere I barely remember or sets me back 30 minutes I've already done. Without those issues, this would be an easy 5 stars for me, but until then, I can't.
is, time, third, This, This is my third time purchasing this game and putting in over 100 hours. What more can I say? It's that good.
's, game, perfect, It, Slay the spire is one of the greatest games of all time. It's such a perfect mobile game and I have hundreds of hours in it both on Android and on Switch. Easy to jump in, addicting gameplay with a ton of replayability. These devs put so much love into the game. Only reason for 4 stars is 2 major issues: 1. It has some problems and delays when syncing data. Sometimes startup takes 15-20 seconds while it "syncs data" for example 2. Sometimes completing ascension doesn't unlock the next level.

Is, port, great, this, Is this a great port? No... The controls are finicky, and as a Pixel 4A user, the draw pile button is inaccessible. But it's still one of the best games you'll ever get on the Android. It's an absolutely stellar roguelite. One of the best.

is, step, literal, which, This is ridiculous. This port doesn't seem to care about selections you make on screen, instead playing cards at random because you weren't precise enough because of BS sticky card selection. Also, the sync data feature lost all of my data, which is a literal step down from the version of this game on console and pc.
is, game, straight, this, I have 600 hours in the PC version. This is a port of that, and if you want the best experience, play on PC. Minus 1 star for constant data sync issues. You lose 30 seconds to a full minute every time the app starts to sync with something else. Why? There is no online component, this is a straight single player game. I hope I'll be able to play this in airplane mode, which is the whole reason I bought it. And then it wants to sync during each run, randomly, which causes card selection to hang. Speaking of: Minus 1 star for terrible card selection controls. If you pick a card, it is almost impossible to "unpick" it or put it back into the hand. Cards almost play themselves if you mistakenly chose them. For new players unfamiliar with all the cards, this is terrible.

is, port, good, this, Mediocre port, great game. We all know slay the spire is great, but this isn't a good port. It's the exact same UI as on PC and the touch controls really don't work that well with it. Prepare for TONS of mis-inputs. Be very careful scrolling thru cards if you need to make a selection as the scrolling often gets misinterpreted as a selection. Pretty frustrating that they didn't learn anything from the switch port. It had the exact same touch control issues.

is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game that has become trash due to and awful user interface. I LOVED this game on steam on PC. But due to the current unfriendly interface, which makes me constantly play cards unintentionally, even when I'm being carefully....makes this game unplayable. I want a refund. I feel like I got screwed over.
is, app, best, This, This is probably the best app you could have on your phone
is, cardbuilder, first, This, I can't convey just how much I enjoy this game and that it's not pay to win! This is the first cardbuilder I've gotten into and I have sunk about 20 hours into it this far. 100% worth the money. (Slay the Spire came recommended from a friend)
's, rouge, good, it, 10 dollars for it to crash every time I beat the end boss ... into crashing every few times when I re-launch the game. :/ it's a good rouge like game but the crashing hinders the game experience. Waste of money to buy mobile, would stick to pc.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game and everything i have about 50hr 9n the pc and now the mobile version is great too HOWEVER THERE IS A BUG WERE U CAN'T LVL FROM 2-3 WHEN PLAYING SILENT
's, game, inferior, It, The controls are terrible, not a proper port to mobile. Get Dungeon Tales instead. It's an inferior game, but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game, but if I exit the application after saving a run and then reopen it there's no "continue" option. I have to start a new run each time... Basically none of my progress is saved unless I sit down for over an hour to finish a run without exiting the app
's, game, lovely, it, This is like a 4.5 star game with 1 star controls. Deselecting cards is too difficult. Potions as well. You'll accidentally select cards as rewards when you really are just trying to figure out what a keyword in it means. I don't have enough space to describe the tricks of getting around such flaws, you'll just have to learn yourself and no doubt screw up numerous runs in the process Beyond that, it's a lovely roguelike game with a great aesthetic and huge replayability.
's, port, mobile, It, It's a mobile port but it doesn't suck like most mobile ports do lol
's, way, great, it, Great port for the most part. Sometimes selecting a card can be difficult and I've had some minor lag when playing on tablet. Other then that, it's a great way to play on the go.
's, port, terrible, It, For being a 10$ app purchase it really fails to deliver on a mobile platform. The cards are difficult to choose and the game feels clunky to play. You can tell it was made for PC and converted as an after thought. It's not that slay the spire is a bad game. It's just a terrible mobile port and there are significantly better and more mobile apt rogue like deck builders in the market. Will update if changes are made

is, problem, big, which, Slay the spire is a brilliant game - well balanced, addictive and replayable. The port however has significant issues. Run progress saves inconsistently and I've lost several autosave files in the sync at startup. The controls are a bit fiddly as well so it's easy to select incorrect cards at times, which is a big problem in a roguelite. The support has also been lacking as these issues have existed since launch. A couple of fixes are needed to give this game the port it deserves.
is, game, great, it, While this android version is still buggy with selecting cards, it is a great game. Hopefully, they fix it soon. So, I will give it 4 stars for now and if they fix it increase to 5 otherwise I will have top drop it down a couple stars.
is, version, brilliant, this, Massively improved since first release. Now almost no bugs.Only issue is that it can be really hard to change which card is selected and it keeps trying to play to same card rather than change selection. Other than that this is a brilliant version of the best solo deckbuilder.
is, game, favorite, it, I have so many hours in the pc version of this game, and I adore it. Slay the Spire is easily one of my all time top 10 games, and believe me, I've played a ton of games. However, the mobile versions controls are in fact, abysmal. In some cases and situations almost unplayable or even unfair. I really, really want to give this game 5 stars and while it is a favorite game of mine, the current handling of cards in hand and selection in a few menus almost makes 3 stars feel generous. 5 stars if fix
's, issue, only, that, Perfect game! The font is a little small and that's my only issue.
's, game, good, It, I like it. Hope keeps adding new stuffs. Very chill and fun game. But there still some UI issues and needed improvement. Overall. It's good game. Gonna go try the PC version. Cause it got less issues than mobile.
's, game, phenomenal, it, Great game, I have it on PC too and that version I'd easily give 5 stars. I can't do that with this version until the controls are fixed. I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally played the wrong card when trying to select a different one all because of the weird sticky controls. I don't know how they managed to make a card game difficult to control but I'll be darned if they didn't find a way. If/when that gets fixed I'll bump this up to five stars since it's still a phenomenal game.
be, finicky, little, it, As I saw mentioned in the other reviews it can be a little finicky with selecting cards and it can be hard to select potions. It is still the same great game though. Addictive, fun and just the right level of frustrating.
