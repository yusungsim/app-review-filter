zoom, from, screen, The mobile version is actually my preferred version because of how accessible clicking the character is instead of having to hold down a joystick as they slowly walk. wish the option was in other versions. love the zoom in and zoom out from the screen as well
playing, for, year, I absolutely love this game. Been playing for over a year and can't stop. I recently upgraded to a new phone and I'm having trouble switching over my current saved game to this new phone. Is there a way to do that? I really would hate to restart all over again when I was so far into 2 saved games.

tell, for, price, Picked this up out of boredom, lemme tell you, for the price, this is worth your money. It's a fun game you can play anywhere. Definitely recommend stardew valley
put, with, Tycoon, Best game in awhile that I've played. I put it up there with Terraria and Roller Coaster Tycoon and Retro Bowl.
found, in, theater, Alright, I found a bug, in the movie theater if you use the ckaw machine and get out again it makes you stuck their, cannot move, you can only restart the game and restart the day again.

waiting, for, update, Just waiting for the new update. Hope it comes soon :/
attend, to, them, So much fun. Make sure don't have any pressing life matters when you start this game because you will not attend to them at all.
playing, for, year, I love this game so much. Been playing it for nearly a year. Cannot wait for the 1.5 update to come to the mobile version.

play, in, minutes, Cozy gaming win. This is a great game to play in the few minutes I get while watching my babies. It's low stress and chill, but I can still go and kill things in the mines when I feel the need.

gets, after, while, It's a solid game that gets boring after a little while. Good game though.
play, with, girlfriend, I love this game,I play it so much,at least 4 or 5 hours üíÄüíÄ,but will there ever be multiplayer because I would love to play with my girlfriend.
download, onto, device, Good game but it would be nice if I didn't have to restart the game every time I download it onto a new device
fits, into, pocket, I'm into it, best RPG game that fits right into your pocket!
play, on, chrome, I think its a great game and i watch youtubers play it and i dont got the setting that they have but it still super great the way it is i play on a chrome os lap top and it still runs great
make, to, me, Overall a good game, but there is one thing that doesn't make sense to me. Turning crops of different quality into food makes no sense, when that food is all the same quality. I like to farm coffee beans then turn those beans into coffee before selling them, but it makes no sense turning higher quality beans into coffee when that coffee would just be the same price as a cup of coffee made with regular beans. Each quality crop should create food equal to the quality of the crop used.

work, with, joystick, some of the cutscenes that require you to move Dont work with the Invisible joystick controlls
feature, on, pc, This is really good! It would be better if the 1.5 update will be added and the multiplayer feature too like on pc. I hope soon!
immerse, in, world, Life has left you unsatisfied and depressed, so you immerse yourself in this virtual world to catch a glimmer of what it could be.
fills, in, soul, I'm away from my pc for several months right now and this game fills the void in my soul
start, on, phone, This game is great and can be addictive. I just have a small issue. The newest update doesn't start properly on my phone I have no idea why I changed nothing on my phone I have tried redownloading the game and all kinds of things but haven't found a fix.

waiting, for, update, patiently waiting for the 1.5 update
playing, on, platforms, After playing on multiple platforms and for over hours the game is phenomenal when it comes to goals, gameplay, and feeling of achievement. Great 2D graphics and well done mechanics made this my favorite farming simulator. Although some parts of dialog are repeated and events are always the same, great game.

taking, from, business, I can't say enough good things about this game. I played the PC version, several years ago, but now I have this to pass my time on long flights or when taking a break from my e-commerce business. You want to buy this and have it on Android forever. A+

love, at, beginning, Best farming game ever, I downloaded this a couple of days ago and haven't put my phone down. Really addictive, I love the simple graphics and all the interactions you can do. I love the different maps at the beginning and all the animals you can look after. The only disappointment is I got far into the game, I cleared most of my farm and had chickens and cows and I've gone to log back in and it's gone. My game would usually automatically save and be fine the next day but its gone now. :(

run, at, times, My favorite game on mobile period. Which is saying a lot considering I run emulators at times playing classic AAA titles on my phone as well.

gotten, since, January, I love this game, just a little upset that the mobile version hasn't gotten an updated since January.
crave, for, something, It is a great game but when you finished all the main story it just then feels old and crave for something new. I think it needs a Online multiplayer mode that you can interact with other people.

own, on, pc, I love Stardew Valley and own it on both my pc and my phone. Both have their own quirks but are both excellent. I can't wait for ConcernedApe's future projects!

introduce, after, days, Basically no tutorial, time goes by way way too fast, I can't find even half the people to introduce myself to even after days of searching. Fishing is ridiculously difficult. Finally caught a fish and I couldn't figure out how to put it in my inventory so my chatter just dropped the fish back in the water that I spent half the day trying to catch. It's way too much to manage and gives me nonstop stress and anxiety. It's just not for me

built, by, himself, I AM 110% IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, like if you like farming, a long based game .. it just has everything and more. The only thing i'm sad about is the fact that .. the 1.5 update isn't on mobile but i do know that the creator is trying his best to get out there which i think is amazing considering the fact that he's built this inspiring game by himself. The creativity is definitely 10/10 !! Can't wait for more.

work, on, farm, Really love this game and would love for their to be maybe a local play or 1-4 people can play together since it's supposed to be a small community. But still Id love local because then I can work on my farm with 3 or less of my friends or maybe my siblings!!!

comes, after, while, This game is very addictive, and a (mostly) wholesome farming game. It's fun to watch your character develop relationships with the in game characters, to meet the goals in the game, and to find all the little fun things hidden throughout. There comes a point after a while where there aren't any more goals to meet - but android has yet to receive the latest version which includes Ginger Island and gives players more to do. Plus, it's fun to restart at least once after you learn all the tricks.
played, in, phone, Its the best game i played in phone and i hope there is new games like this.
need, with, island, Need update asap, need full content like pc version, with ginger island, I post this feedback 3 times, but got removed. Why so?
fish, in, game, Love this game BUT! It is so hard to fish in this game which makes it almost impossible to progress in some areas. Unfortunately I just cannot seem to be able to catch anything but trash and I really would like to unlock the tree thingy :(

Addicted, to, game, Addicted to this game. Been playing for 2 months straight. However, I do hope the 1.5 updates will be ready soon. We really need the "add to existing items", move Greenhouse, Shipping Box and walkways!

play, in, tablet, no cross device support! I love playing the game, but I would like to play in both my tablet and phone and I can't do this. This is just unacceptable for this day and age :( I would give 5 stars but this is a major let down for me.
closed, on, me, I love the game but it glitched and closed on me one day and I haven't been able to access my saved game since. I'm uninstalling it now to see if when I reinstall it I'm able to I really hope I can access my saved game again. If it gets fixed I would be happy to give it a 5-star rating
wait, for, updates, This is a GREAT game you can start a farm, a family and create and make your own farm! And so much more. Can't wait for new updates on mobile!

working, for, me, I love this game however.... it stopped working for me. It won't even load I'm devastated.
look, at, wiki, This game is an amazing port from the PC. It is very relaxing and cozy. If you like animal crossing you will like this too. If you need help look at the stardew wiki...it is the best game wiki page i have ever seen.
lost, to, it, Hundreds of hours. Took a bit to get into, then I lost hundreds of hours to it.
waiting, for, update, Been waiting far too long for the 1.5 update. Will mobile be getting some kind of bonus content because of the wait? Used to love the game but I've been bored for a very long time.

wait, for, update, This game is brilliant! I really enjoyed playing this farming game, I don't care if it's still on 1.4, I'll patiently wait for the update.
done, by, person, Absolutely amazing game. Beautiful work, and it was all done by one person. I will always recommend this game to people.
wait, for, sequel, Amazing game can't wait for the chocolaty sequel
comes, to, mobile, Why wouldn't you want to buy and play this game it is such a good farming RPG i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT and the mood it sets is amazing the only thing is that i would like if there were more npc's to marry but i would rate it 100/100 if i could and i just can not wait till the 1.5 update comes out to mobile!!
bought, on, console, I have bought this game on every console I owned. This game never failes to disappoint but to newcomers, this game is way better on console. But! That is one big BUT... this version still serves its overall premise and still holds true to the story and gameplay. You can even use a Blue Tooth controler of you don't like the tapping controls. I just haven't discovered what update this version is on, so things may be missing from this particular version.

purchased, on, tablet, Perfect Game. Ive purchased it on tablet, pc, ps4 and switch.
happen, in, game, Exactly what it states it is. Developers do not oversell, misrepresent and present events that do not happen in-game. This is a fresh air considering the incredible number of false adverts these days. Does not force in app purchase. Worth every penny and I'll buy it even if its 2x more expensive.

Can't wait for the day Ginger Island comes to mobile. CA, you're a genius, and deserve all the fame and glory and love in the world.

is, in, Horizons, This is an awesome game. There is so much more to do than there is in Animal Crozsing New Horizons.
got, on, pc, Love this game, bit behind the times. Didn't know how popular the game was. Now got it on my pc too.
place, on, walls, The game is really good. But there are a few issues. The arcade game is really hard to play because of janky controls but if you practice it is possible. And the last one is you can't place anything on walls. I took of my window from my house and I now live in a cardboard box with no light. I can't see the exit now. I can no longer see. Send help.

take, with, me, I can take the best game on earth anywhere with me, what's not to love? The controls are fantastic, the graphics are just as good, I can transfer my save back and forth from my PC, and I can ruin the farming economy of a small town, epic.
's, From, youth, Simple but yet complex, funny yet mildly scary, repetitive but yet never ending fun. From older youth to adults there's something for all. The options for additional mods and user created content will keep this game alive for much much longer even now being out for a few years, I love when I found this "Indie" game if you can even call it that anymore? If you're interested in why you see this game get so much attention and countless videos made about it, download it and see the fun yourself! 5*

play, on, go, So much fun! The app is just as good as the pc version. It doesn't have the new update yet but it's half the price anyway. For those waiting the new one will be on here eventually just a heads up. Very calming and fun to play on the go.
care, about, mobile, I love this game. But the dev doesnt really care about mobile. We don't have some features of 1.4 update and we dont have the 1.5 update (for more 8+ months)
meet, with, villagers, Very good game, finally something without micro transactions, energy, loot boxes etc. I was so frustrated of standard mobile games. Stardew Valley is slow, story driven farming experience where you meet with other villagers and you try to find friend and love there. 10/10
put, for, stars, This game is a really good game. The only reason why I put it down for 3 stars is that. . . Even though I've been playing this game for a while and started a couple new farms. The game sometimes kicks me out for no reason when I travel to places. Sometimes when I'm walking from the path from the house to the town and I enter the town I get kicked, and today was the last straw when I got 2 prismatic shards. (Only had 1 in my chests) Then I went drove back to the bus stop and went back and kicked.

bargained, for, that, Downloaded this ti play something akin to harvest moon, got way more that I bargained for. Loving every moment. I would suggest installing the Stardew Valley Expanded mod for some extra NPCs and cutscenes.

updated, across, platforms, It's a great game but I'm disappointed that the app has yet to recieve the most recent update to Stardew Valley that is available on PC and the games creator is already creating a new game before the old one is updated across all platforms. It would be nice if we had the update on mobile before the end of the year.

talk, to, them, This is wonderful and LGBTQ+ inclusive, but there's one thing: Children. I'd like to be able to actually talk to them and interact with them as otherwise they have little purpose and are quite uninteresting.

finding, around, farmhouse, fantastic, i love the mobile version. However, the path finding around the farmhouse is going to be my thirteenth reason.
love, about, it, Good, love everything about it
do, in, update, Amazing game all around. Two issues, however, the newest update for the game is not available on mobile and this version can get stale very quickly since there is a lot more to do in the 1.5 update. Another thing is the mechanics are questionable and sometimes the auto-combat uses a pickaxe or a scythe instead of your weapon, and sometimes the combat just doesn't work or stops you from being able to move because you are locked in trying to hit something that is too far away and can't stop.
come, with, upgrade, Love it, but come on with the upgrade already!!
takes, from, you, This game is fun and easy to play, it is a game that very much takes the time from you
love, until, year, I love the game until 1st year of winter how come after 28 days of winter theres 29th day of winter ? please fix the bug. Thanks

wait, for, update, This is my life. Can't wait for the big update
adds, to, value, Clearly the best farming sim out there. And at the same time it is so much more than a farming sim. There are so many things you can do and so many paths you can choose - and that really adds to its replay value. And there are no ads and no in app purchases. You pay once and then you play it. This is the kind of game you could log a lot of hours on if you wanted to, and never get bored. There are layers of hidden things to unlock.
had, since, Jan, Special Order board...it not on mobile, or from what I can tell its not and I'm not sure why. It hasn't had an update since Jan of this year so one would think that it would be up to date by now. If not for this, I'd definitely give it 5stars but I hate when a game like this don't have all the content.....

run, into, problems, Love the game, haven't run into the problems and bugs other people seem to. My biggest gripe is that it lacks a few features from the newer updates on other formats. Like edible monster meat from the combat tree, new places to visit, co-op, etc. So it's behind PC and console.
updating, to, version, Fun, insanely addicting. Always something to do. Just curious when mobile will be updating to the 1.5 version. Tried contacting developer but no response. Playing on my phone is definitely easier, but my switch has the updated version, So I might go back to playing it there.

looking, to, update, Very enjoyable game. Just when you think you have played it all, something new surprises me. It is a very fun game to play. Easy and very well done. Im looking forward to the new update on this and the new game you made.
reminds, of, Moon, Amazing game! It reminds me of Harvest Moon with more thought put into it. Hopefully they have the update soon on mobile, I can't wait!

waiting, for, update, Been waiting for an update for 10 months now. Disappointed. Uninstalling
working, in, area, I have the desktop version, Started working in an area with little to no cell service and long drives daily. This helped me play when I had the time but was not available to play on desktop.

makes, for, gameplay, I love this game, its very entertaining and unlike alot of other games like it, you dont get filthy rich, you aquire more money but you buy more expensive things too, its very balnced witch makes for very good gameplay!
play, on, PC, This game combined elements from Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, and other old classics into a new and wonderful story. It's easier to play on PC, but I couldn't help but grab a mobile copy as well!
went, from, stars, Been over a year still no update. You have went from 5 stars to 1 I'd rate you a 0 if I could. Games unless now.

help, around, farm, It is great its like real life and you get to have a family like you have to start a family to help you around the farm and it's actually really great ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
hold, to, mine, Needs better controller support. I expected controller to work the same as console or pc. Like being able to hold buttons down to auto chop/mine. Would be nice to have cross save compatibility also
connect, to, play, My best purchase all time! It works smooth üòå üòé üëå üòè ‚ò∫ üòâ edit I got bored and never played it ever since. Edit again I started playing it correctly and it's fun buy I wish we could connect to Google play so I won't lose my farm if I somehow change devices üò≠üò≠üíî
Need, like, !, Need more updates like pc!! üëé

go, to, files, i love this game but im having an issue. i can start up the game but when i go to the files and click my character, the screen turns black. i can hear the music and birds chirping but i cant interact at all. i even waited for a while. i tried to force stop. i dont know how to fix it. i dont wanna start over and make a new character since ive been playing on it for a while now and dont want it to go to waste. what do i do?

playing, for, week, I don't rate apps or games normally, but I LOVE this game, my best friend told me I should download it and I was skeptical because farm games are always so boring, but THIS is WAY more than just farming. It's romance, strategy, great story line, and you have SO many things you can do. Each NPC has their own vibe, and you can give gifts to them to become friends and maybe even more than that. They have likes and dislikes too. I am on my 3rd year (in game) and I've been playing for a week now.
own, on, platform, This game is so relaxing I own it on every platform. It was simple to switch to the phone from PC or switch. So claiming and the music takes you into the game.

kills, for, me, Love the game. Was 5 stars but the lack of updates every other platform has kills it for me.
crashes, for, me, Incredible. That's the best word for it really. One guy, making such an amazing game like this. The PC version IS better yes, and if you can get that one. But for me, my pc version crashes regularly so this version is a god send. Stardew is my favourite game of all time. Abigail and Leah are my waifus, and I wanna hug Sebastian. Thank you Eric
love, on, mobile, I used to love stardew Valley, on mobile I was able to see a lot of things, even go to that level of mysterious Mr Qi in Skull Cavern but then I had to factory reset that all data went in vain. And even if I want to play I don't want to start from day 1 :(

progress, in, game, This is terrible it won't even allow me to progress in the game, it won't even allow me to unlock Willy's boat.
saying, in, nutshell, I love this game, it's really fun. I wish there was more updates, though. Maybe you could add a feature where your child can learn how to talk and maybe become friends with other villagers (so your child can go outside instead of just the house)? What I'm saying in a nutshell is please add more updates soon instead of working on other game(s) because Stardew valley is really fun! Once there are more updates I will change my review to 5 stars. :)

leaving, with, children, The year is 8. Day 25. Winter. Cold. Freezing cold. My husband won't stop leaving me alone with the children. Day in, day out it's the same thing over and over. Gather my crops, water my crops feed the animals, gather up the slimes, sell, sleep, repeat. I think I'm slowly going insane. I finished every task, befriend every unnaturally friendly towns people. I walk to the middle of town and shout at the sky...WHERE HAS THE UPDATE GONE. But alas, it's left us...AND SCENE. *Takes a bow*

Downgraded, from, stars, Downgraded from 5 stars to 1 star. It seems we smartphone users don't deserve 1.5 update.

play, on, phone, So happy with this!! I love being able to take this anywhere I'm going, I can play this on my phone or on my consoles. Unlike graveyard keeper, the app actually works and it is just as fun to play! I have never been so happy to spend money on an app before

had, for, while, This game had been a great stress reliever for me, it's the only place I actually feel productive. I really hope the mobile version gets the 1.5 update like the pc version had for a while now. Please bring the 1.5 update to mobile!!!!

learn, about, characters, Extraordinary game <3 The first time I played I didn't like it. The second time I gave it a go and took more time, and the more time I took, the more I wanted to play and learn about all the characters.
downloaded, with, card, So when I first got this app I was so excited because YouTubers were talking about so I thought it was really cool. But when I downloaded this with my gift card it didn't seem to work and screen stayed how it looked. I opened this app from the app store and it worked. I honestly thought I would be better. Also I am used to playing with arrows pointing up and down aka like minecraft. Or like roblox bc I play roblox a bunch. But it's probably because I bought this on moblie. But it's a good app!

thank, for, storyline, Hasnt been a month since i downloaded this. I love it thank u for this beautiful storyline and the game itself üò≠
appear, in, collection, Shipping items for me has been kinda glitchy. Lots of items never appear in my collection of items shipped. Puffer fish, duck eggs, iron, gold and iridium bars, kale. I like the pc version but this im having doubts about. Been playing for 5 plus years on the game and made countless trips to skull cavern and killed tons of dinos but never received an egg

redirected, to, store, I watched all the YouTube videos but when I downloaded the game and tried to play it didn't work. It just redirected me to the play store and said "You need to install and set up a browser to view this content" and I don't know how to fix it at all.
played, on, console, Love the game. I played alot on console, and I'm happy to play it on mobile. Can't wait for new updates and the spiritual successor to drop.

lose, after, while, Needs the 1.5 update. Started to lose interest after a while of playing. Needs more content
buying, for, amounts, bought it can't wait to see what all it holds. Updating review .Might as well buy the memebership & let the jojoa mart buy the hall. The fishing is nearly impossible the way its done. Sadly I had very high hopes and any one with hand issues or children playing will be unable to finish quests or community cener unless buying the fish for crazy amounts from travelling merchant is your goal and then not sure he offers them all. They need to change the fishing style.so to 3 stars till fixed.

progress, into, bless, I love this game more than animal crossing. It's so therapeutic you can play it almost anywhere. And there no in game purchasing to progress into the game bless üò≠üôè
searching, for, fish, Awesome game. My only complaint is the fishing mechanics. They are ridiculously difficult and hinder access to game play. I'm stuck searching for fish I need in the trash.

played, on, Xbox, I really love this game, and everything about it. And this is one of my favorite games, ever. I've played it on Xbox, computer, and now mobile. For me this game just never gets old, and there are not many flaws. I've made countless worlds and there are so many things to do, and when you do everything you can just start over and do it all again. Which I could do forever. I recommend this to everyone that can buy it.

do, like, game, Ok, I do like the game, the simple graphics remind me of the long hours spent years ago playing those 8 bit RPG's on my old NES. Unfortunately I seem to have some control issues with some of the mini games. The game in the saloon for one, the guy doesn't move & just get's killed. Fishing doesn't work except on the first try when ya first get the pole. There's probably more that I haven't found yet. If I resolve these issues I'll revise my rating.

dropping, for, game, This is jaw dropping for a one man developed game! From farming to mining and combat, everything in this game is in depth and rewarding. Worth $4.99 and more. Recommended

love, on, PC, I love this game on PC. I would give it 5 stars but the mobile version is almost a year behind the PC version in updates.
start, from, zero, The game is perfect, the only thing missing is cloud save, I'm about to change my phone... And will have to start the game from zero again...
Bought, for, that, No Chinese language. Bought it specifically for that.
waiting, like, players, I absolutely LOVE this game but like many other players I am waiting for version 1.5!?!? I hope it's coming soon because I'm sure it will make this game even better!

Edited, From, star, Edited: From 5 to 1 star. You know what? I paid for this game just to wait and wait and wait and to start again. I'm on Year 9 and now I have to go back because I lost my phone. There's no online save. And now you're looking forward for your new game? How about us waiting for 1.5? You're so unfair! Ofc, life is so unfair! This game is my stress reliever but now it's one of the worst. Oh god I regret buying this game ü•≤ I want to be a game developer someday and I will never be like THIS ü•≤

had, on, mobile, It's a pretty good game I could play it all day, but I do wish it had Co-op on mobile I'd like it a lot more if did, but over all it's good üëç
downloaded, on, platforms, I absolutely love this game. I have downloaded it on so many platforms. Its amazing.
Waiting, for, 1.5, Waiting for 1.5 on mobile. STILL. And now other platforms are getting yet another update. Seems like mobile has been abandoned.

sunk, into, it, Honestly one of the best games I've ever played, have sunk hundreds of hours into it and it has no ads. Only shame is that it's a version behind all other platforms and this version has no multiplayer.
digging, through, trash, I love this game and developer. 5 stars HOWEVER, the mobile game isn't for me. I really liked it. It's pretty intuitive. Combat is... challenging. They offer plenty of controller styles. It's just not as fun for me, and I like my bigger computer screen when I'm digging through the trash. Totally worth the money. Very fun, I've just been spoiled with the computer version.

adapted, for, mobile, Great farming sim game. Worth the money. Surprisingly well adapted for mobile.
's, during, year, Really fun game Initially challenging but it gets less difficult as you go and figure out what to do/gain skills. Very cute design. There's festivities during the year and they're incredibly cute. Lots of nifty details and ways to engage with the town and the villagers within it.

wait, for, update, The best game on the playstore in my opinion. It's addicting and so so relaxing. I can't wait for the new update for mobile. I have spent over 200 hours in Stardew valley and that's must on one device. 100% recommend

buy, for, that, Love this game, I resently got a Switch and just had to buy it again for that. Now I have to choose between this version[fave exploit works but missing 1.5 content] and that one[has 1.5 content but fave exploit dosn't work]. If/when this version gets the 1.5 update it will bump the rating up to 5.

speedrunning, with, brother, I love this game! It has a lot of choices and careers to choose from. I love speedrunning Stardew with my brother and racing him to finish all the content. But I am still waiting for the 1.5 update on mobile. Besides that it is a really good game.

spend, on, game, I just have endless love for this game. I was hesitant to spend money on a farming game, but it's much more than that. Bought it years ago, I've kept it on every phone ever since and I love playing it. It's well worth the money and time, I love it so much I also have it on PC and x box, which I've found isn't uncommon with Stardew fans.

played, since, favorite, Stardew Valley is so much fun and the closest comparable (happiness meter) game, I've played, since my favorite, Harvest Moon 64. Is definitely worth the price, there's all these fun, interactive, unique and creative little extras in the game.
try, for, ages, Wanted to try it for ages and it lived up to expectations - super Chil cost game üòä

used, to, controls, Love the pc version, took me a second to get used to mobile controls and combat has an auto attack which is helpful on mobile. Giving 3 stars to show my disappointment that the mobile version will never have multiplayer. 5 stars on literally every other platform.
ported, to, mobile, Perhaps the greatest. indie game of all time smartly ported over to mobile. This game will swallow up your life. Touch controls work better in some elements (farming is much quicker) but not quite as good in others (combat). Still, an absolute must have for me.

play, with, phone, Played all the farm.. married all bachelor.. and stuck , play with my phone.. ginger island please üò≠
Play, at, pace, I would recommend this game to people who want something with no combat or violence. There is combat in the mines but the critters you're up against are very slow and the damage is so minimal that it isn't stressful to play. I was going to completely avoid the mines but now I'm happily making my way to the bottom. Great music and immersive and relaxing sound effects. Play entirely at your own pace .
enjoy, on, console, I enjoy Stardew Valley on the console so I decided to try it out on mobile. I really enjoyed it on my trial so much I will most likely buy it later and I NEVER spend money on mobile games.

rate, at, stars, Love this game BUT had to lower my rating. I'd rate it at 5 stars if it weren't for lack of cloud sync and multiplayer. They're kinda required for this game! Beginning to regret getting it for Android. Sigh... PS had to rate lower due to all the negative reviews that seem valid. Disappointing...still no sign of updated version on Android.

own, on, everything, One of the best games ever , own it on everything I can play it on. Will give 5 stars tho once I can use full controller not a mix needing touch screen
sits, in, way, Stupid dog sits in the way of the bed so I can't sleep. Now I gotta pay the evil doctor to wake me up and use their magic gtfoutta the waydog powers. Super annoying. Fix it plz. Or give me the option to abandon the dog since it's gonna cost me thousands in hospital fees.

looking, at, What, 5 stars isn't enough. You know what this is, you know ConcernedApe. What you're looking at is the single greatest farm life RPG ever created. Animal Crossing can kick rocks. This game has farming, combat, FISHING, friendship, romance, customization, mystery, and anything else you'd want out of this genre. It is, in my opinion, the mold by which every other life sim should be judged. Pick it up here, 100% it, convert your save to PC and mod to your heart's content.

waiting, for, update, I love the game! I really do, but, please we are waiting for mobile update for a loooong time. I appreciate your team's work! All support! I can't afford the computer version just yet and I was able to afford this game since it's also cheaper than the pc version.

Ported, from, pc, Ported over from pc you would expect it to loose some of its fun. That did not happen here. The game is its same lovable self and is still great fun. I could not give it 5 stars however for 1 simple reason. The lack of multiplayer like the pc or console platforms have. Taking that feature out broke my heart. I have so many fun memories of booting up a farm with my brother and working together on it. That experience is now lost for mobile players. Its a mistake i hope the developers fix.

bought, on, steam, I bought this game on steam, switch, and android. My favourite game.
complain, about, something, Overall the game is really good and well thought out and I love the characters and their developments, I've played off mobile, but if I were to complain about something ON mobile it would be the story plots. I cant live them, sometimes when I get to interact with characters it freezes and I can't watch the plot go on and thats something I'd like to experience, but overall, the game is great. I would love to see more games like this in the future.

love, about, it, One of my favorite games! I love everything about it. The art style is beautiful, I love the free roam aspect, so many secrets to discover, the stories are so entertaining, and I love how interactive everything is. It's definitely worth the buy/download
playing, for, game, It's good for a first game at this company it's really nice how they made a animation for every thing I also love how there is a calendar and there's birthday's and event my favorite event right now is the egg hunt and my second favorite was the jellyfish things I'm not sure of the name of the event but all I can say is it's beautiful üòçü§å For an offline game it's nice I would say the purchase was totally worth it I would spend my 1 hour of playing for this game sorry for the long message
put, in, dryer, A game where you can dump hours into and still feel productive.... Till you remember you didn't put the laundry in the dryer

love, about, it, I love this game its so cute and fun and i just love everything about it
have, on, tablet, I have this game on my tablet. I think this Is a really fun game. The thing is tho I can't figure out how to fix the broken building. But it still is an amazing game to play
play, on, PC, Since I play this normally on PC, I opted to give this a try on mobile. My two stars are because of: 1. Buggy controls. Controls did not work fully as intended. Tapping option wouldn't have my character move and I had the same issue with other control options. 2. Constant freezing when walking, talking, or just trying to play. It became frustrating and made it almost unplayable for me. 3. No 1.5 update and no statement since July about progress. At least say something to your mobile players.
grinding, at, game, After grinding at this game and putting in hours and hours to get a sprinkler so I can expand I find out it does basically nothing so now am unable to expand my farm without a massive amount of grinding. Very disappointing as I was excited to see the farm grow

play, on, mobile, I've been playing a lot of single player farm simulation type of game. and this game is without a questions, is the most exciting and enjoyable game amongst every other farm simulation game. Theres a few reason for everyone to play this game. First, the price is affordable. It's not that pricy for this kind of game. Secondly, the storyline is fun and acceptable. And last, you can play it with what ever way you want! Trust me, this is the best game that i ever play on mobile. Pubg is not a match.
allow, for, stacking, Great and addicting game. Please allow for easy stacking of items with the button on the side and please update controller play as well. Some things just cannot be done with controller like placing of farm buildings. Equipting of rings or boots or clothing. Other than that this game is great for adults and kids alike.

put, in, box, My game doesn't have any updates. Like when I put stuff in my box the up arrow is missing, so I can't auto add and that's really tedious
play, at, home, WHY IS THERE NO MULTIPLAYER ON THIS VERSION???? THAT WAS THE WNTIRE REASON I WAS EXCITED TO PLAY! DELETING GAME Sidenote: I was actually planning to get the PC version this payday so I could play on there when at home but I'm not spending the money on it when you guys left suck a big hole in your mobile game..

released, in, years, Has crashed a couple of times but considering its easily the best farm based life sim released in the past 12 years I believe its easily worth a try.
play, with, mate, THIS GAME IS SO FUN! But sadly I wish I could play with my mate, would you like to add multiplayer options? The rest is perfect, I won't complain any further.
play, on, pc, This game is honestly brilliant. I play on pc, switch and mobile and I just can't get enough of it! You can farm, fish, forage, interact with npcs, mine and honestly so much more. There's honestly so much that you can do; I'm really enjoying filling up the museum with artefacts and gems now! My wife's abigail so it's really cute and it's so nice to log on and see the world that you've created! Also I have loads of ducks so that's cool too!!! I would totally recommend.

's, for, while, My friends has been uninstalled the game because there's no new things for a while...
Reminds, of, Zelda, Dudes. I just like it. Reminds me of a passive Zelda. The touchscreen function is superb; nailed that. Five outta five, easy.
live, in, idaho, Good game ,but hopefully concerned ape will add some option to give your dog a treat and fetch a stick ,especially hes american ,then make the game American ,most (not all) american like to give dog a treat ,i live in north idaho in a logging / farming town so i really like this game , especially when relaxing and doing nothing.

waiting, for, update, It's a good game but please, we've been waiting so long for 1.5 update and multiplayer function especially! I checked the forums and people have been asking for multi on mobile since 2 years ago! Please make it happen :(

playing, for, awhile, I have been playing this for awhile, and I LOVE IT! The only thing Is SUGGESTING! Not complaning, suggesting! I would really say you should add co-op and multi-player to mobile/chrombook! I would love to play with my siblings and all that. But, as I said. I love it! I would definetly say this is my favorite game out of most of my games, and. There's a lot of them! Over-all, if someone asked me; 'Hey! what adventure roleplaying game to you recoomend?' I would say THIS! Over-all, this is great! <3

Update, for, mobile, Update for mobile when???? It's been like a full year going on two?
bought, on, mobile, Okay I love this game, I've bought it on mobile, ipad, and pc, but why is there still no ginger island? If it's too big to put in this version I understand, but what about the special orders board? Please, give me something new to do. After a couple hundred hours of the same thing it's bound to get kinda boring lol. Right now pc is way superior if you want the full story.

click, on, plate, anytime, no matter what the gift, i gift abigail she only gives me one response "hey how'd you know i was hungry? this looks delicious". another problem, i cant buy any of the vault bundles, i try to click on the plate to open the bundle and it wont open :( other than those bugs i love this game so much
play, on, phone, Can't believe I can play this on my phone. So good.
waiting, on, ver.1.5, Game is great for a mobile port but I'm still waiting on ver.1.5
play, on, PC, Just get a switch or play on PC. Pref PC it's a great game.
became, because, game, No joke, got me a girlfriend in real life. She plays this game alot and she first became my friend because of this game. So we ended up dating.
agree, with, Jenkins, Absolutely beautiful and was fun for hours. I wish you could color your home and buildings ect. and I agree with Dan Jenkins
lost, in, game, I can get lost in this game for 12 hours

puts, in, repetition, It's fun and very interactive! You don't have to be good at it to have fun. All of the town's people have individual personalitys that are fun and enticing. The flow of the game is good and puts a nice purpose in the repetition. The grafics are fun to see. The only problem I have is with the fishing. I find it overly difficult to do.
sunk, into, this, An amazing mobile port to one of my favorite games. I have sunk so many hours into this and enjoyed every one. The controlls are clean, and it has a great mobile adapted interface. I am excited for 1.5 to eventually be implemented
like, including, cavern, I like this game although level 80 through 120 is hard including the Skull cavern's
escape, from, life, This game is my go-to escape from real life ‚ù§Ô∏è. Very relaxing. Game lets you go at your own pace.

playing, for, YEARS, Stardew vally gives me much joy when I play it. It gets me away from family problems and it helps me when I feel anxious. Stardew is such a mysterious and fun game. I've been playing it for YEARS on end. I started out playing it on my dads computer but now I'm not able to. So when I saw it on mobile I instantly asked my dad if he could buy it for me. I'm not disappointed at all with the purchase.

move, to, island, overall it's good, very nice 'old school' graphics and storyline, attractive gameplay. but the thing i missed is the ability to move to canary island, which is very good to play if it was added to the mobile version. if i can get the updates, i think it'll be a great decision to give full 5-Stars to developer.

do, with, setting, Excellent farming but the fishing minigame is next to impossible on mobile which gates some of the content. It could do with an autofish setting (similar to the autocombat)
ü•∞, Like, üòç, Like this üòçü•∞üòòüòòü•∞
needed, for, item, Very fun game to play. My favorite thing about the game is that it is not a pay to play type game. The only payment is the initial purchase and then it's free. No special tokens or gems needed for any item.
need, as, rpg, A great game that has everything you need as an rpg
having, with, it, Very good adaptation, very faithful to the console/PC version, only real criticism is that fishing is 1000 times more difficult and that was my specialty so if I'm having a hard time with it then most other people will struggle. If I could give 4.9 that would be my actual rating.
update, in, july, Still waiting 1.5, concerned ape announced that in july they will soon update it and here i am still waiting lol
Bringing, like, nothing, Bringing back childhood memories like nothing before
do, in, game, The best farming game ever. Whoever play Harvest Moon PC mode, will love this game for sure. There are still many things to do every single day in the game, endless in other words. I'm waiting for new patch, please release ASAP! We thirst for more!‚ù§Ô∏è

put, at, times, This game is amazing and I can't put it down at times! The reason why the rating is low is because I can not sell multiple items effectively. I put multiple items in the box as suggested by others but my stuff dissappears and is lost and I only get money for 1 item per shipping which is really annoying... is it a bug? Can you help me please? I play on my mobile

update, at, store, When will stardew update 1.5 at play store? I love this game so much
have, in, game, I have over 600 hours in this game, and without a doubt, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Everything about it is absolutely great. The music, the range of characters, the story, everything. Kudos, ConcernedApe! I'm really looking forward to the 1.5 update on mobile.

play, at, pace, Let me start off by saying this game is fantastic. The beauty of the game is you can play at your own pace; Nothing is forced down your throat. The music is both beautiful and peaceful. There's not a sound track I dislike. There's something for everyone in this game. It is not all about farming. There's a plethora of things to enjoy. This is truly a one of a kind game. The experiences it has to offer is like no other. A definite escape from your reality when you open this app.
play, for, hours, I play this game for several hundred hours every year, usually around winter because I get super depressed at that time and Stardew Valley is better than a therapist.

I played religiously until a month or so ago when I ran out of stuff to do (other than cooking... I can't seem to bring myself to care about cooking). Update: Lost more stars because I'm still waiting for new content.

controls, to, liking, Great game. wonderful art style, and easy custom controls to your liking. Over all just an amazing experience
waiting, for, island, Honestly one of my all time favorites, it's a great sim game, worth the purchase. I have the steam version and I absolutely love it, 10/10 game! Just waiting for Ginger island.
play, on, phone, Great game love it addicted but i hate how u cant play multiplayer if on phone or chromebook
Play, on, tablet, Great game but the controls are terrible on a small screen. Play this on a tablet or on console, you won't regret it! 5 star game with 3 star controls
got, on, PC, I've got ~210 hours in it on PC, and the mobile version is just as good. Only minor gripe is that the controls are iffy at first, but you can change them.
changed, to, 200, This is a 5 star game 100% but i just need help. I accidentally changed my Date size to 200 and now it blocks 75% of my screen making it unplayable. Due to the size i cant click on settings and change it back. I did not make a backup save and i really dont know what to do because i did a lot on that specific save.

left, of, screen, Got addicted the first day I played it. It's kinda hard to maneuver the joystick though because it's in the middle left of the screen. The joystick makes it hard in the combat part but overall, it's addicting. Thanks developers for creating a great game!

spent, in, opinion, Good little farming game that's brings back memories from childhood worth every penny spent in my opinion. It's like playing an old Zelda.
walk, across, town, The shop keepers aren't at their post when the stores are opened sometimes. What a waste of a day when you walk across town, find a opened store, and the shop keeper is goofing off somewhere.
lost, in, time, I absolutely love it its so cute and i get lost in time playing this thing
got, for, it, would be better if the fishing part was do able. But ya know you got your money for it so it doesnt matter how playable it actually is.
finished, with, port, I'm finished with this mobile port. The Creator should have found another Company by now to complete work for a current update and already have been released...
got, to, festival, Awesome game... when i got to the egg festival however it didn't allow me to pick up any of the Easter eggs
talk, to, folk, This game is amazing! It is so relaxing and fun! I love how you can talk to all the town folk! Overall it's a really fun game 100% recommend!

run, like, poop, I really want the 1.5 version, without it, my mods run like poop
catch, to, version, I love it but when will the mobile he catch up to the PC version? I've pretty much beaten the game in 100 hours but the more I look up the more I see about version 1.5, that isn't on the mobile version. Just wanted to to know if 1.5 is ever coming. It's a great game tho.

play, on, mobile, I would love to give it a higher rating but until they make corrections on the fishing to make it possible to play it on a mobile and allow items to be built/placed outside the farm, i cant recommend the game. Did the devs abandon the app?

combine, to, game, basically it's a nice game, but it could be the best game if you combine it to life simulation game as well.. where their children will inherit the land and proceed with the mission.

rolled, In, ways, In many ways, the full stardew valley experience rolled into mobile but with automatic saves; very useful. Only issue, not full 1.5 version. Is waiting for that final touch.

look, after, stock, Uber amounts of content, beautiful graphics and gameplay. Farm your own vegetables, look after live stock, go for a quest down the mines, go fishing, unlock tools and equipment or find the one to share you life with. It's a farming/life simulator on steroids essentially. Feels like work, but isn't actually work. That's the beauty of it.

played, on, computer, I have played the game before on our computer. I'm super happy its on phone but hope for more improvement in opening and closing the boxes, controls
fit, into, platform, I'm personally amazing that CA managed to fit his entire game into the mobile platform. It's lovely, a great farming sim where you can get immersed in your inherited farm and start a new life, even if it is a virtual one. However, I can't offer that 5th star only because of a personal preference- I don't think this game should be played on a phone because it can be a little more frustrating. Tablet? Maybe. Computer or console? Absolutely.

have, on, laptop, Wonderful game! One of the best I've ever played. Love it. I have it on my laptop as well and its even better because of the controls. Otherwise its the same. Only bought the mobile because I loved the laptop one so much. I 10000000% recommend this to anyone ever. I haven't enjoyed a game like this since I started playing minecraft

cuddle, under, blanket, Perfect game to relax and cuddle up under a blanket, especially now in autumn. It helped me a lot when I was stressed out and burned out. The one thing I'd love is outside furniture and such, but I just did it wrong. Haha

came, along, ‚ú®, Having multiple boyfriends at once used to be just a dream for me, until SDV came along ‚ú®
got, for, fiancee, I originally got this game for my fiancee and she loved it so much I decided to give it a try. I can see why she loves it! This game is a nice vacation away from the stresses of everyday life.
Hoping, for, update, Hoping for the new 1.5 update soon
handed, to, you, Veyr relaxing and yet fun game progress feels earned and not handed to you
played, on, pc, I played Stardew Valley on pc first and downloaded this when it came out. I was surprised to find that it was the same as pc and I am very happy about that. It is a super relaxing and enjoyable game that always seems to have something new to do. Worth the $ for sure!
waiting, for, updates, still waiting for the updates.
play, As, someone, As someone that loves sit down and.. actually play games ( i.e. pokemon, city builders, etc. ) this game is phenomenal. I didn't even know about it until I found it after getting game pass. ( mid September, 2021 ) if you like farming, the benefits of seeing your work progress, while also have relationships, children, and a PET, this is for you.

played, for, hours, Completely worth the money. I got it thinking, it's not super expensive it will probably last a week. I played it for so many hours! Yet, I'm not boarded of it whatsoever. It's at a point where I now have it on my computer too. Such an amazing game. Edit: I'm on year three and have also gotten it on the pc, I am obsessed best games ever.

feel, like, reviews, I am very happy with the game but wish that it had Ginger Island and a multiplayer feature. There have been no updates since I started playing the mobile version (I already love the PC version) which makes me feel like the reviews and suggestions are not being read by the creators. Please expand the game and add the multiplayer function üôèüèΩ
patch, for, mobile, When Patch 1.5 will coming? Im so excited patch 1.5 in mobile... I hope this end of year patch 1.5 for mobile will comeout...
look, at, faces, I love stardew of the valley and proud I don't care what people think nope nope nope! I rather play this game alone all day then look at their sad faces of wasteful existing space taking mesh of biological elements any day.. or no dust. They dusty yo.
waiting, for, update, still waiting for 1.5 update
do, with, bff, I absolutely love this game but the reason I give it 4 stars is because I would like to do muliplayer with my bff in lockdown but we could not but that is my only problem overall great game one of my favourites
mixed, with, stories, Worth to play if you are a fan in harvest moon games in the past and it is mixed with interesting stories, character development and rpg
getting, into, games, I like how you purchase a whole game. No BS in game purchases. This game is soooo much fun and i have a super hard time getting into games. I barley play anymore but stardew valley is so addicting and easy to get into and understand. Theres nothing really much of a learning curve you just live out your days lol. No rushing whatsoever thats true! Everyone says that and its so relaxing you can just chill. Theres always somthing to do however. This game will never have you bored. Always somthing
Listen, to, Lofi, Best game ever!! Listen to Lofi while playing it turn it into a better experience.

water, with, jug, This is an awesome evergreen game, just a hint for android players: When trying to water plants with your water jug and if it auto switches to scythe and removes your plants, kindly observe these plants are gone and turned to yellow colour. Hope this helps.

get, in, amount, This is my ideal game. Self-paced, relaxing. The game play is very simple, yet there the storylines add a lot of depth. You can race to accomplish goals and get rich in a short amount of time, or just kick back and feed your chickens and cows and feel perfectly content. I've been playing for a couple of years now, and it's still my go-to game when I want to spend time just relaxing and feeling happy.

supported, on, mobile, It's definitely one of the best mobile games available. I just wish multiplayer was supported on mobile too. I just hope that whatever the next game developer makes it atleast supports multiplayer on android.

played, on, PC, I have played the game on PC for around 1000 hours and I have the Switch and Mobile version now. I've played a bit on my phone but the controls don't feel quite as smooth as with a keyboard &mouse. (Granted it's limited to touch screen only so with how smooth the controls are dispite it's limitations it's pretty good) The gameplay is great and the bits of story for each character is charming making it easy to love the characters. The music is great Easy to ignore time and be emersed 11/10

lost, in, gameplay, One of the best games of all time. There are so many ways to play this game and it's so easy to get lost in the gameplay. If you enjoy the Harvest Moon games or farming simulators you will love Stardew Valley.
play, on, phone, Amazing, controls are hard to get used to if you don't play on phone as much as other devices though
play, on, go, Stardew valley is an amazing game and having the mobile version be just as good as PC I'm happy and I can play on the go!
play, with, friends, it's a fan game yet no multiple player its kinda unfair since some of us don't have any money to either buy a computer or switch it be much more better if you add a multiple player choice so other can finally play with their friends plus it can attract more players that way unless you did this on purpose so other people we'll just the game on their computer and switch just so they can be with their friend smart move yet quite unfair

played, on, phone, This is the most addictive game I've ever played on my phone!
wait, for, update, Can't wait for 1.5 update
go, to, website, i found a way around it. if you bought the game and it still wants you to rebuy it. you need to go to the playstore website and then install it off there. then it will work
choose, from, ways, Very good game, love the festivals and the heart events, also being able to choose from different ways you would like to spend your time is also phenomenal for a game. Also when will the new update be out? Just asking cause I can't wait!!üòä
meant, for, computer, This is the kind of app I wish the app store had more of. The developer took a game that was originally meant for the computer and flawlessly allowed for it to work on mobile. You really don't find that often. Stardew Valley is an incredible and soothing game, one of the most well-made games I have ever played (for mobile and desktop both), and by far the most comforting.

bought, on, platforms, Amazing game! My personal game of the year i have bought it on at least 4 different platforms
wait, for, update, Love this game!! I honestly can't wait for the update lol
added, to, game, This game is amazing but it will more amazing if you added co-op to this game.
confused, as, heck, No guide for beginners ,, confused as heck...
broken, on, tablet, The controls are broken on Samsung tablet
made, on, store, STELLAR GAME. I've been eyeballing this game for awhile and finally decided to get it. Best decision I've made on the app store so far. Cant wait for what you guys are planning next
playing, by, phone, I love this game. I had the pc version and I love this just as much although playing by phone I wish there was a way to save my game mid day if I am playing while waiting to do something else it would be nice to be able to save. But all around great game.
bought, on, platforms, Best game I ever played! Well worth the money, I have bought this game on multiple platforms, makes a great gift for friends too! Highly recommended!
have, on, most, I have way to many hours in this game!!! I love this game I have it on most of my Console. this game run so smooth and I love it!!
have, for, close, What is the point of sync your save from pc if the don't have the same version of the game for close to a year now. I'm desapointed.
Played, In, While, One Of The Best Games I Have Played In A While!
interact, with, board, I really LOVE stardew valley but I can't interact with the builtin board in the community centre even though I'm pressing the tablet Help ‚úì >:(>:(
suck, on, tho, Great game, controls suck on the phone tho, I even connected a game pad and constantly find myself needing to touch the screen, bait won't attach to poles, and missing feature of being able to sit down on benches and chairs and what not. Also game glitches you in place if you cast a fishing rod and quickly change slots , found this out on accident trying to use bait. Was able to recreate it . Only way to fix it was to reload the game. Buggy but good, better on other platforms

sit, on, benches, Great game, controls suck on the phone tho, I even connected a game pad and constantly find myself needing to touch the screen, bait won't attach to poles, and missing feature of being able to sit down on benches and chairs and what not.

came, across, game, I love Harvest Moon, so I've been trying to find something similar. I came across this game and it's been my favorite game since. I actually ended up just purchasing the game on ps4 and will probably do the same once I get my desktop set up. Literally is becoming my favorite game of all time. I hope the updates never stop

compared, to, controller, A degree more frustrating than the normal version, this version needs a controller. There are many control options but I find them lacking, and I don't see how it couldn't be compared to a proper controller or keyboard. A useful backup feature is kind of nullified by a cruel auto save feature. Accidentally axed an ancient berry? It auto saves sometimes on close! How convenient and cursed. Guess I'm starting that day over again. Screw gates, let your animals be free.
play, on, phone, Love this game but does not play easy on phone. I'll stick to PC or Switch.

sell, for, access, Absolutely fun time killer, with a lot to actually do. Great story too, as long as you follow the community quests and don't sell your soul for easy access to some features (you'll get what I mean when you play the game.)
look, like, dwarf, This game is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING it's got great atmosphere and feeling and a good personality the performance on this game Is exceptional but I have but one request for the dwarven helm at first I saw this and thought wow I can look like a dwarf but it was an artifact please make this a feature, overall rating 4 stars
appears, in, game, I like it so far,but does the boat still appears in the game for mobile??so far I didn't manage to get the back room on Willy's..it's true I payd joja but still no boat or other üèùÔ∏è.thx

waiting, on, update, Fantastic game and it being mobile is amazing. Just waiting on 1.5 update!
abandoned, for, ages, I feel like the developer has abandoned this game for ages ago
playing, on, PC, I've been playing on PC for a few months and love it. The mobile versions is amazing and very well adapted. Movement and actions (chopping trees, mining, watering crops) much much less awkward than I thought it would be. Highly recommend!

purchase, in, order, Bought the game, and when I tried to open it, it said I needed to purchase the play pass in order to open it
playing, for, years, I love This Game I've been playing it for 1 and 1/2 years, But when will the 1.5 update Come To Google Play Store. This Is my Concern because the website said that it is supposed to be this Christmas that was before last Christmas. So can the creator of this game when or will there by 1.5 For The Google Play Store?

got, through, times, Stardew Valley has given me so many hours of joy and got me through hard times. It quite literally changed my life. The only things I'd like to see added are mobile multiplayer and more characters, cities, events, etc - really just more of it! I know that Stardew V. Expanded is a hit, but it would be nice to have things like that added into the base game, without all the extra work required for mods. With that said, I love the new features that do get added and I'm excited to see this game grow.

think, of, thing, Can't think of one thing wrong with this port. Love the game ‚ù§Ô∏è and totally worth the price of üé´ admission.
waiting, for, layout, Great game, but been waiting 7 months for the new farm layout. Will rate it 5 stars when it comes out.
play, on, lunch, Great casual game for me. Something I can play on lunch at work.

waiting, for, update, Eric Barone, stop neglecting your android fans. I absolutely love this game but it's going to be almost one year soon that we've been waiting for the 1.5 update while everyone has been playing for months and we have nothing left to do... Very frustrating

feel, by, myself, Hello! I really love this game, but there are times that I feel lonely by myself, would it be possible to add the multiplayer mode on the mobile version? Still, I am always excited to play this game, i loved how it does not force me to do the tasks, and let's me accept them first if i want to. This game is a rare gem! rarer than iridium oresüíñ

think, of, solution, If you don't already know stardew, then it's a great game on its own and easily worth the money on every platform. My main concern with the mobile port was how they would handle the dramatic change in control scheme. But surprisingly, this is one of the best PC-to-Mobile ports I've ever seen. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and besides a couple inxredibly minor issues that I can't think of a feasible solution for, it's perfect. Can't reccomend enough.
saved, via, cloud, I thought progress would be saved via cloud... Had to change devices and lost all my progress. :(
Reminds, of, series, It Reminds me of harvest moon series for the gameboy advance. Very nostalgic. I really enjoy this game.
holding, till, 1.5, I love this game so much and I'm holding 1 star till 1.5 comes out as a sign of a REVOLUTION! I mean peaceful protest*
comes, as, sign, I love this game so much and I'm holding 1 star till 1.5 comes out as a sign of a REVOLUTION! I mean peaceful protest*
bring, to, update, Best game ever just wish they would bring it up to PC update
got, like, clash, Great app but the only reason why I gave it is witch there was a cloud save at least for one base u got like clash of clans but Ik here it's gonna be hard but 1 base can be done no?
waiting, for, version, still waiting for version 1.5
Paid, for, game, Paid for the game, cleared space for it and it wont install. Tried closing playstore and reopening and now getting an error when I attempt to install the game. You got my money, please let me have a game I love.

waiting, for, months, Absolutely love the game and its design as well as the game play, however I fully completed the 1.4 edition and have unlocked everything is almost a year ago, when I heard the update was coming out back in February I was so excited to get back into playing yet we still have no idea when the new updats will come and if it will finally give us mobile players the option to play multiplayer?? Ive been waiting for months but with brief info on what the update will bring Im feel totally ignored.

focus, on, projects, I really love this game. I just wish that mobile users were allowed to get an update to progress further. I finished the community center and the movie theater but I'm not allowed to progress because I'm on version 1.4.5. I know the creator doesn't care and wants to focus on other projects, but it makes me think, why would I bother downloading a future game from the same developer if I know I'll just be disappointed when they move on to something else?

tap, over, screen, Encountered a game breaking bug. I'm one year into the game story, and any time I open the game now, I can't get my character to walk anywhere. I can tap all over the screen, but my character doesn't move. I tried reverting to a previous save, but the issue persists.

love, on, PC, I love Stardew on PC and I'm so happy I can now bring it with me wherever I go!! There are a few issues unfortunately. I can't seem to figure out how to remove bait from my pole. Also my character doesn't choose the fastest route when I pick a spot to walk to. In fact, she'll sometimes go completely out of the way to go to the chosen spot. I have to micromanage the fastest path, which isn't a huge deal; a minor inconvenience. I also can't wait for updates that bring us closer to the PC version.

playing, for, weeks, It is worth my money! I've been playing this game for about 2 weeks and I really enjoy it. Well it's kinda frustrating when I went fishing on my first year. I was also clueless about how to set the crab pot with a bait. But yeah I'm on my third year now and I've mastered itüëå (thanks to some guides on g0ogle). Also I really like Vincent & Robin characters and personalitiesü•∫üíï I hope there's a marriage candidate as cute & nice as them lol but it's fine tho single is also a good option anywayüòÜ

relaxing, for, game, This game is MASTERPIECE. It is so relaxing for farming type game. You can do so much things while waiting for your crops to grow such as mining, fighting monster in dungeon, foraging, fishing and develop friendships with the villagers. It is my favorite game so far. However, the game takes so long to update and we're missing some of the feature that already exist in other device platforms like Ginger Island and Multiplayer mode. I will surely change my rate if developers will update it soon. TY

cope, with, version, Same game quality as its on pc. Maybe there is a little struggle in tapping or rotating some furnitures but still manageable. If there is one thing I want to add is that the android version could cope up with the latest version in pc. It is more diverse and eccentric and will help for the future plan of players that last til end game. This is a great game. One of my favorites üëç

For instance, I will sleep on the 9th night and supposed to wake up on the morning of the 10th‚Äì there‚Äôll be a prompt that the game is saving but when I decide to restart my day, instead of going back to the morning of the 10th, IT GOES BACK TO THE MORNING OF THE 9TH??? It‚Äôs so confusing. Please fix that.

taken, from, account, The worst game ever...I will be checking to make sure there is NO money taken from my account!
play, on, mobile, If you love farming, some added difficulty if you want, and leisurely entertainment this is the game for you! Stardew beats Harvest Moon and other similar games by leaps and bounds and is overall the best farming time sink you can play -whether on mobile or pc!
cheating, on, phone, Bought this for my kids who are special needs and it's not friendly for anyone with special needs and health and mental health problems the game even after the last update isn't worth the stress and since mods are used for cheating on the phone's and pc clearly can't play any games honestly
get, After, years, After 2 years of playing...now when i load my save i get ambient sounds and black screen. Tried everything to fix it and nothing. So i'm not gonna waste more of my time on a game that corrupts saves.

rolled, to, Android, It's cool but wondering when the 1.5 will be rolled out to Android. Got to move my shipping box!
s, on, steam, Overall great experience though i am wondering if the 1.5 update thats on steam with the tiger slimes and the volcanic mines is going to be integrated into the mobile version.

invested, in, game, Best indie game, I love it. I own the PC version too, with thousands of hours invested in the game. Wholesome and just pure creative awe and epic moments with amazing stories and characters ‚ù§
played, on, pc, I played this on pc and love it mobile is just a good
played, on, device, This has got to be one of the most relaxing games I have ever played on a mobile device, and it has so much to do, endless enjoyment for a remarkably fun experience. I LOVE this game.
get, to, mine, It is really fun you get to make your self, you get to mine, you get do harvest, like I said fish, and you get to do a lot of other things. you can also marry single people if you gain enough hearts.
paying, for, apps, The game has so much depth I'm like 60 hours in and feel I haven't even scratched the surface. I'm not a fan of paying for apps as I hop and change often and would try and help you save money if I could but this game well deserves its price tag and some! Legit a 5 star game for 7 quid... Its a no brainer guys... Edited to one star. My save file has just randomly been deleted.

feel, with, phone, Wish there were ways I could like fast travel back to the farm when I don't feel like clicking on the ground the entire way there with my phone. And if the cat would stop falling asleep in the doorway and yall making it a mechanic to not step over it so I can get to the frickin bed to sleep, that would be great. I dont think anyone appreciates having to over exhaust their selves to sleep so they don't have to wait for the cat to move. But it seems like yall devs don't care anymore.

playing, on, gameboy, Took me back 10 years ago, when i was playing harvest moon on my gameboy.
playing, on, iphone, Concern: game crashes sometimes while playing on my iphone. Haven't yet experienced it on my Android, hoping that it won't. But overall, love the game. Very addictive worth the purchase.

experience, in, village, This one is good RPG game to experience an imagination life in a remote village
shows, as, dog, It's great and I'm completely hooked. I think there is a glitch with me cat's icon where she shows up as a dog and I think my third year got turned into my fourth year prematurely which I think glitched the second visit I think I was supposed to have with my grandfather. Had another glitch where I was stuck in my fishing pose, I let it sit until 2 am for it to unfreeze. Other than that, super fun.

sign, on, divices, best game ever just wish i could sign in on other divices
playing, on, console, Absolutely love this game! Just like playing on console!
fishing, with, help, Okay with the help of google and a lot of patience, I got fishing to work. One: you pretty much must stick with the training rod for far longer than a reasonable person would expect. Two: you have to use your finger to fish. A stylus will not cut it for the gentleness they require in the tapping.

come, to, version, Great game, good enough to make me want to leave a review (and I have never did that). Hope update 1.5 will come to mobile version soon!
stuck, in, house, Please update the mobile version!! :( Also oh my god if I get stuck in my house for hours again because my husband is blocking the door or stuck in the coop because chickens are blocking me in (etc. etc. It happens constantly with anything alive) I'm literally going to scream. We should be able to phase through them!

played, on, platforms, This game is absolutely amazing and I have loved every minute of it. I have never played Stardew Valley on any other platforms, and I'm glad I decided to give it a go. I am hoping that Ginger Island gets added to the mobile version at some point as I've heard a lot of great things about it.

move, into, place, This game is absolutely wonderful. This game starts off with your character getting tired from populated life, finding a letter that their deceased grandpa gave them a long time ago, they move into a place called Pelican town. There are many things to do in this game, you can focus on your farm and upgrade it. You can build the community center to get the ending of the game. And you can interact, and marry some, of the variety of characters and their different backgrounds. Amazing farming game.

go, to, school, I am begging the devs to see this. Please update the kids! Please! I wish they could grow to childhood and they go to school and have they own personalities. Maybe in teen year they argue with you. But childhood should last like 2 years and maybe teen is where they should stop growing, so they can at less help out. I don't know I just don't want them to stop aging at toddler. Maybe we could change their outfits and hair. Thanks for reading and let me know what you guys think!

detailed, at, time, This very quickly became one of my favourites. It is so simple, yet so detailed all at the very same time. It is exactly what the player needs it to be. I can't give this game enough praise. It really needs no explanation.
Wondering, For, Time, Great Game But Just Wondering An Estimate For Time Till The 1.5 Update Is Out For Mobile Thinking About Buying For My Xbox As Well
