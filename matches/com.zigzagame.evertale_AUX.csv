's, stage, regular, it, False advertisement, the gameplay doesn't match with the ad. I played evertale months ago, the game tricked you with the rpg-like gameplay on the first chapter but then chapter 2 comes and it's just a regular stage selecting gacha game. You can catch monsters but the strongest monsters are incredibly underpowered comparing to the microtransaction monsters. The only progression you could make after finishing the tutorial part of this game is via gacha units/items from microtransaction.
's, knockoff, boring, it, The ads are not what the game actually is it's just a boring pokemon gacha knockoff that uses misleading ads and pictures to trick you into buying it I do not recomend buying this piece of garbage
was, game, complete, that, It's a gacha game. I spent money to buy this game that I thought was a complete game. If you use fee to pay mechanics at least be free. Super generic. Dropped it fast
's, game, enjoyful, It, I really wanted to like this game, but the graphics in combat are so bad. The story it's a bit boring. It's just not an enjoyful game
is, game, favourite, It, It is my favourite game ever I like it...
be, pay, big, it, pure and utter perfection and it's free to play if you get the game on discount plus no annoying adds. But it can be a big pay to win so that is a downside.
's, NOTHING, like, it, This add is a false advertisement. I bought this game & it's NOTHING like is advertised. Fun game indeed. But an extremely heavy at 2 win game & is nothing like the pokemon style games like it shows in all the commercials
am, player, F2P, i, No thank you, am not playing this game anymore. You spend freaking 3000 soulstones (i am a F2P player) and get only 1 sr weapo for every roll. Seriously? Im quitting this game.
's, game, good, it, it's a good game to play
's, game, great, It, It's a great game
's, game, fun, it, The rolls aren't bad it's a fun game
's, gacha, generic, It, Don't let the ads fool you, there are no horror elements to the story. It's just another generic gacha with a boring anime storyline.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but why does it keep syncing 😭 It didn't bother me at first as it was quick and not often. But now I'm unable to even get to my game for some reason. Still a good game though. Have it on my tablet 👌
was, grace, saving, that, Borderline p r o n game.Bearable story, kinky outfits, horrendous gacha rate.Worse still they removed the pvp and replaced it with an auto battalion mode, terrible decision as that was the game's only saving grace.Definitely P2W,farming resources takes too much time.Past SSRs are severely weak compared to present ones.The devs most likely wont rebalance them.In short,don's waste your time here like me,spend it elsewhere wisely.If you don't have a reason to stay away,hey,at least do it for me!Thx
is, weapons, normal, All, Decent so far. UPDATE 11/17/21: Had to delete. I've spent money in this game but cannot pull a decent character. All I get is normal weapons. Cannot waste anymore time or money for basically nothing. Held on for as long as I could.
's, nothing, amazing, it, It's ok. The story is too boring for me, but I enjoyed the Snow White sub story, and I think those little stories are probably the best they got, but it's still nothing amazing. Gameplay is neat. Very simple and quick RPG, but lots of different things to make team building neat and possibly interesting. I hate Gachas the mix weapon with heroes, and I absolutely hate the rates in this game. Finally, a lot of the female designs and art get way too lewd for me. I think some surpass Azur Lane.
's, rpg, good, It, It's a good rpg so far
's, game, good, it, It's fun and very entertaning i'd just wish i didn't constanly change from being free to costinga dollar, but other than that it's a very good game
's, gamd, butiful, it, soooo much fun and it's sooooo worth the $1, it's a butiful gamd
's, game, hard, It, Nice story, Love the characters, but It's hard to get SSR In the gacha, I only have 2. u have 5% chance to get one SSR maybe fix that. Plus If u want to buy something, It's expensive. But It's not hard game to play If u know the strategy 😎
is, draw, big, that, Great art, easy to figure out game mechanics, interesting character, overall not a bad game. The two down sides to this game is: 1. They could have done more with the story. The story give you that old handheld Final Fantasy feel with not much to do or explore. 2. They need to separate the weapon drops from the character drop. Since that is there big draw and push is characters and weapons drops they should separate them so people can pick which they prefer.
's, game, good, it, it's a very good game full of strategy and planning but to makers please increase character summon rates because they are so low

is, game, complex, This, So much fun! This is a complex game, but once you get the hang of collecting gems and things with daily logins, you can play most of the fun stuff for free, even pulling worthwhile cards. Highly recommend.
is, box, white, all, Never got to play. I was very excited to try this game. Anytime I open it, all I get is a white box with a loading circle. I tried to wait it out, but to no avail. Wish I hadn't wasted that 99 cent on it. Update 11.08.2021: The game was updated shortly after my post and I was able to play. I do like this game, but it's not like pokemon in anyway shape or form; I do not love the false advertising. Also, you really need to regularly pay to compete with the other players on the server.
is, time, first, This, Even though it's hard to get at least a SR char. in a 10x summon, the game itself is very enjoyable. The more you play, the more you get immersed on it. This is the first time that i get so hooked in this type of game, and i'm learning a lot. Thank you. 😊😊
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice Time killing game. I love it
is, game, better, this, they say this is like Pokemon if that's true it's pokemon on drugs the ads do this game no justice this is a much better game then final fantasy 7 and way more active then Diablo my only regret is that it don't have more side quests for chapter 1 if there is a way to add more side quests that can be completed please do otherwise it's perfect

is, game, good, This, This is a really good game, good story/content, but i think the characters should wear more clothes, because its kinda weird. Also the gacha is really bad, because its only 1% of ssr's and its really hard to earn soul stones, so please, improve the gacha. And also, i think this game is too greedy, i mean, if you buy something, the price is really high and the things you get arent that good, so we would like to see some improvements. That's all. Thank you for your hard work! :D
is, game, good, this, A good game, but I Uninstalled when I realized it was a pay to play game. They give out gems so sparingly that you advance EXTREMELY slowly after a point. If you plan on spending $50-60 in a game, then this is a good game for you. If not, look elsewhere.
are, writer, great, you, This game is awesome and the story line is fantastic. Cool game creater you are a great writer and a good game maker
's, game, amazing, it, it's amazing game
is, game, good, This, This is a good game
were, weapons, same, those, You guys have the worst sr and ssr character rate drop. The chances of getting a sr and a ssr weapon is much higher than a character drop. Only characters I have been getting are just rare characters. I have used the 1k gems summon 3 times and within those 3 times. I have already gotten 3 ssr weapons. I would say 2 more times but those were just the same weapons. So fix your character rate drop when summoning cuz as of rn sr and ssr weapons are already extremely guaranteed.
are, odds, lowest, They, I love the whole world. The story and the artwork are all really unique. However, I can't play a gacha game that gives you a 1% chance at hitting SSR characters. I won't even spend money because those odds are way too low. They are by far the lowest odds I've ever seen on a gacha game. Mixing in the weapons in the character pool is a unique way of making sure it costs users more money to get any good characters. I'll never understand this strategy.
's, update, new, it, I played this game long ago, back then this game was really cool, like the combat system, Pokemon-like style, story, characters, etc. Overall is good even with the gacha system is fine. Then now I'm back, and just saw black and discorted theme, I think it's just because their new update for Halloween, but it's not. The bad thing is, this game ads are FAKE. Which is very creepy, and not even advertising this game and they're stole other game footages. Just bring back the old Evertale
's, experience, amazing, it, Should have auto level up suggestions and pick for teams. Overall it's amazing experience.
's, killer, fun, it, it's a fun time killer, not much else to say really. I'm still going through the main story, so I cant say much about end game or anything, but it's a fun rpg

's, game, good, It, It's a really good game. I love playing it.
was, moving, free, that, The story is very engaging and challenging at a certain point. Though I would like to have other ways to get Limit Break Potion for Characters aside from Raids. And also, the Online Story; it should've been just like the offline one that was just free-moving (?) not click on a spot to proceed...
's, game, good, it, it's a really good game it's kinda a 4v4? type game and the mechanics are really good and the art style aswell and this is a really good game to cure boredom
is, game, good, this, it's a really good game it's kinda a 4v4? type game and the mechanics are really good and the art style aswell and this is a really good game to cure boredom
's, game, decent, it, I bought the game because of the misleading ads. Even if it's a decent game, that's not ok.
is, game, complete, it, Where to even begin? How about adds. Show your game for what it is, I have to say other than some other upsetting stuff, its actually a pretty good game. Great story and gameplay. Now a warning for everyone this game, while it isn't a complete gacha game it is partly a gacha game. You don't need to make in game purchases but, as you will figure out a little later, purchase are encouraged. Also the difficulty level, some of these bosses are off the walls. Other than that a pretty good game.
is, name, set, It, This game is great. I was hooked within the first 20 minutes. I am pretty upset that you can't customize your character, or change the name. It is just a set name and a set character, but all that aside, it's still a great game. The story is great, the characters are great. 10/10 recommend!

is, game, good, this, I took advantage of the sale that made this game free to play and originally it cost a dollar but once you start playing it you'll find out for yourself that this is a good game and is more than reasonable for the dollar so if it is still free or for a dollar your still getting this game for a steal if not a great deal
is, blow, REALLY, which, Story: 8/10 Combat System: 4/10 PVP Mode: 3/10 Fighting in General: 1/10 Extra Notes: · Fakes it only has a few megas on play store, then you open the game and it instantly asks you to download around 250MG of "updates", which I think is a REALLY low blow. · Combat always gets me confused. · Hud is confusing. · Basically a Pokemon Rip-Off, but more confusing. · Way too many transactions for a paid game. · Gameplay is boring and repetitive. · Game isn't fun at all. Final note: 1/10

'm, XD, real, I, great game love it yes I'm real XD nah but fr its dope
's, way, good, it, it's a good way to pass the time in all honesty. simple reminds me of Pokémon with a little more mid evil age era.
was, roam, free, it, Great game I loved the offline story but the online story could use some work, I wish it was free roam like the offline story and I wish you didn't have to use many other then that I love the game, im thinking about uninstalling it because with put the free roam and Manta usage to continue the story makes it really annoying to play. Still would definitely tell others to play tho.
's, game, different, It, Literally all ads for this game is completely misleading. Not a single ad shows legitimate game play. It's definitely a different game in them. I'm highly dissatisfied with the purchase. Pretty sure I could sue for false advertising.
was, reason, only, Which, First off i give it a 2 because it is not what the adds show, not even a little. Which was the only reason i had bought it. But that being said ive played up to ch5 and while its hard to get decent monsters from just random Unique encounters it is over all a fun game.
were, company, american, this, The ads are complete lies. Pure and utter false advertising. If this were an american company they would be sued into non existance.
's, game, good, it, it's a good game
is, game, standard, This, False advertising! This is not a creepy pokemon clone like you see in the ads. They've even edited all the pictures in the Play store to be horror themed, but it's all lies. This is your standard gacha game, complete with annoying energy systems that stop you from playing more than a few seconds without dishing out a few dollars daily. Avoid this game.

is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game
is, claim, bold, which, Impressive for a mobile game. I am enjoying this more than black desert online, which is a bold but true claim.
is, tier, SSR(best, which, Just bad. I'm not gonna talk about the scamming stuff as you already probably know it. The story is just not worth reading. There is no balance between classes. The odds that you pull a character which is SSR(best tier in the game) are really low. The story ends quickly, and the online story is just terrible. Overall not worth your time since after a couple weeks you would probably get stuck and won't be able to make progress.
was, game, different, it, False advertising. It's not and never has been anything like the adds. It's not even remotely horror themed. Played it in the past and reinstalled it thinking it was a different game.....
's, game, amazing, It, It's truly an amazing game, the gameplay is awesome, and the controls are simple, and best of all is the awesome storyline. Definitely deserves five stars
's, advertisement, false, that, All the pictures and ads for the game are not even close to the actual game so that's false advertisement, and I think it's pretty stupid the "beginner SSR" summon only takes paid gems
's, game, great, it, it's a great game to be fair
's, anime, strange, it, Your ads in no way reflect what your game really is. The ads make it look like a Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy Style game but when you play it's a strange angle anime RPG monster collector game, like a Pokemon ripoff. Your ads look like an amazing game. Are those just animations that you created or is there a real product out there that have some of those elements?
is, laziness, pure, which, this game is just a sad and pathetic mess their story is so bad they literally had to make fake ads to make it interesting looking so people would buy it. Secondly, 90% of the sprites and sound effects are all stolen from other games which is pure laziness and theft, not even halfway through the BEGINNING you know its a scam bacause you are not even out of the first area when the game shoves ads in your face telling you to buy their aMaZiNg deals. Scum thats all there is left to say pure Scum.
's, guys, addictive, it, this game is awesome easy to play and it's very addictive good job guys
's, guys, good, it, this game is awesome easy to play and it's very addictive good job guys
was, game, actual, it, Game is ok ads are very misleading the ad makes it look like a creepy old school gameboy Pokemon but its not like that at all and i wish it was the ad looks like a much better game then the actual game if its free its worth trying it but i would not pay money for this game
's, pay, kinda, that, amazing game I don't think It should be 25$ for an ssr that's kinda pay to win, but the story mode is fantastic and worth the 1$
's, game, fun, it, Good game. First part is open world second part is stamina based which is annoying but outside of that it's a fun game. Sadly most things later on take stamina and it takes a long time to get it but otherwise the summons are fun and they have okay rates on summons.
be, hands, free, I, False advertisment. I played this game before, i wasnt going to waste me time leaving this review until i got annoyed enough every time this ad is viewed it'll automatically take me to the play store download page.. yes the only ad every time I literally could be hands free from my phone for it to take me to this page to download. Stop the fake advertising your ad is more interesting than this game. If you're false advertising then you're obviously not that proud of your product. Sorry.
're, advertising, false, you, False advertisment.

is, masterpiece, regular, that, A fun game that is a regular masterpiece on its own. The visuals and story alone are worth it.
is, game, phenomenal, this, reminds me a lot of the games of my youth. Zelda the first five final fantasies this is a phenomenal game. that required to pay to play level up join alliances meet new people have fun.
is, advertising, false, This, This is false advertising, just another gacha game that tricks you into thinking its a horror game in the style of pokemon. For shame.
is, game, fun, this, this is a fun pokemon slash final fantasy game
is, game, final, this, this is a fun pokemon slash final fantasy game
is, 👏, amazing, this, Addicted to the plot. this is amazing 👏
be, game, nice, It, It would be a nice game if it was honest about it's advertising. I thought I was getting a kind of grimdark pokemon-esk game but got something more akin to final fantasy in game play and aesthetics. I didn't pay much attention to the story as I was trying to figure out where the pokemon-esk game footage in the advertisements was in the actual game. The game works well and it has a very pretty style, but it isn't advertising itself accurately to the actual game. It's very disappointing.
's, RPG, good, it, it's actually a really good RPG tho
is, pay, lame, this, Bro this is the lame pay to play pay to win gambling game ever. You buy game currency and it randomly picks the amount of soul stone? This is so bad if anyone wants to play this don't it's a gimmick and trap sure it was fun- ish but common on make it free to play of you are gonna have pay to win aspects
's, rip, stupid, it, It's not even like the adds at all no horror things it's just some stupid pokemon rip off that wants your money
's, rpg, great, it, A little lag but otherwise it's a great rpg
's, game, paid, it, good fun game so far I mean I'm not thrilled with how much micro transactions are pushed since it's a paid game already but so far it dosent seem like micro transactions are needed to make it playable difficulty wise
's, game, good, It, It's probably a good game but I downloaded this game expecting it to be like the ads. It's nothing like the ads. No horror aspect like the ads portray nothing. Any review that says other wise is a bot or lying.
's, game, fun, it, it's a fun game and it's just so interesting
's, game, great, it, it's a great game I enjoy playing it often👍
be, experience, amazing, it, Idk why they wouldn't just make a game that was PROPERLY based on their false advertisements, it looked like it'd be an amazing psychologica horror experience
's, game, made, It, It's a well made game with great artwork and a good battling system. Unfortunately some of the boss battles give unfair advantages as where my heroes could not even damage the boss once which made me switch to different strategies. Some of the levels feel like there's absolutely nothing when you look at it. It's mostly trees, grass and water, I'd like to see like abandoned houses and other props that can make the game feel alive.
was, style, f2p, it, Paid a dollar for it so I thought it might be aa fun indie style pokemon game with waifu art. Instead it was another f2p gacha style. Turns out it only costs money on Google, it's free on apple. Tat would take it to 3stars for me. The 1star is for false advertising, as I just saw an advertisement on YouTube for this game where they made it look like a Pokemon creepypasta with almost nothing relevant to the game even being mentioned. It even started with a generic Pokemon gen 1 sprite.
's, fantasy, medieval, it, although the ad was deceiving. (I thought this was undertale mobile), I'm immensely enjoying the game. it's less undertale, and more medieval pokeman/dbz Dokan battle/classic final fantasy. the story is gripping, it's gameplay reminds me of SNES rpgs like old final fantasy or chrono trigger, and even though they pull you in with... shall we say... chesty character summons.... the app is fully worth the 99 cents.

's, version, fun, it, it's a more fun version of Pokemon 🤣🤣🤣
's, rank, highest, that, Put 30 hours into the game, got 1 SR Character....that's not even the highest rank you can get. Only download if your going to spend cash after buying. And BTW, you can't add another account if you have bad luck. Even if it's your friends email, I think they track your ip address. Only people playing this game are whales, not real gamers.
