deleted, off, phone, I just bought this game and it crashes constantly. It's frustrating because this is my favorite game on Xbox. Love how the didn't leave out any of the things that are on the console game, as most mobile versions usually do. But jeeze it's glitchy. I even deleted a bunch of stuff off my phone in case that was part of the problem. It wasnt. Super frustrating that it constantly freezes and kicks me off, usually right before I go to bed to save. Don't waste money on this till they fix this issue

waiting, for, sale, I was waiting for the sale. As soon as it went on sale I instantly bought it. I am loving it ‚ù§ but there is something wrong with the autopaths and i wish we can edit the controler or resize the buttons :3

sunk, in, hours, Brilliant Game! It's just like Stardew Valley, but way better! I've already sunk in 30 hours of gameplay and there's still so much to do in the game. I can't say anything other than "brilliant".

spent, for, games, Dear Developer, This is the best roleplay game ever for me because i've never spent my money for any games even once before. This game is very worth to buy and so addictive. We didn't compete with anyone (Except Higgins in game haha) that's why it's very relaxing, and healing too. I hope in future you can give Indonesian subtitle and dubbing too, because so many Indonesian fans play this game.. And I hope you can give us more update to make us more addicted with this game. Regards üòä

grinding, on, game, The game is a refreshing take on "farm" sim rpg. The grinding on this game is almost the exact opposite on other farm sim, since you'll take most of your time mining instead of farming. Pro: 1. Combat are fairly easy 2. You can access every storage 3. There is voice acting and a lot of npc to befriend with Cons: 1. The game is fairly heavy, there are some area that will make your frame drops 2. You will lose your time playing this game (wait...its actually a good thing) Very worth it. 5/5

crashing, in, phone, idk why but this games keep crashing in my phone even after I reset the phone
living, in, city, No regrets buying this game, it is a healing game for people living in the city like me.

redo, to, ingame, Game crashes almost every 5-10 minutes. I have an android 8 phone... I know it's not within the recommended specs, but please create a solution where it doesn't crash so frequently. It's hard to do anything when the game crashes so ofter. I also have to manually save the game, so if I forget to save every 10 minutes or so, I'll have to redo a day to two ingame.
connect, to, account, Its wonderful but why i cant connect the game to my account in google play games
sold, in, pack, As of the last update, we can finally get the DLC outfits. However, instead of being sold in a pack, each individual outfit is a whooping $1 each ($26 total!!!) Outrageous to have to buy them separately, and while I could understand a price tag of maybe $8 for the outfits in total, this brings the DLC total over the cost of the main game. Ridiculous in the least, and so much more than the steam version. This move is beyond me, but I won't put a penny into them until the pricing is changed

contacted, on, page, The game is addicting! Love it Edit: I had an issue with albert being invisible so I contacted them on their fb page. They're very helpful and helped me solved the issue. I'm changing the rating back to 5.
takes, from, storage, Great game, worth every penny. I think it's better if the Recovery Machine takes directly from storage. Thanks
controls, on, Pixel, It looks beautiful and controls well on my Pixel. I am grateful to have console quality game optimized so well for fairly old android phone. A complete package. The android technology has very strong gaming potentional and we need more games like this!

seems, like, game, It seems like a lovely game and could become the "new" Stardew valley. But.. I played a while and I didn't like the controller on the screen so I bought a Razor Kichi controller. But I tried the game with the controller and it doesn't seems to work with this controller. Is there any chance you are gonna support controllers in the future? Otherwise it's almost unplayable on mobile.

play, despite, crashes, I wish it ran better but I'm poor and can't afford a better phone or a good enough pc so I'm still thankful I can even play this, despite all the crashes. I just save often. It's a very fun game.
playing, with, controls, My only complaint is there's no controller support. At least for my kishi controller. It's really hard playing a game like this with screen controls for an extended period. I have pretty large hands. My hands started cramping after 20 minutes. I just bought it for my switch lite on the nintendo site. That should solve the problem.

commented, about, voice, The game is really good but ive seen someone commented about the voice acting and ive never heard any when i start the game it would be nice to actually heard each of the characters voices
gone, after, month, Really loved the actual game, but randomly after a month of playing, my entire progress is gone. No way to retrieve. The game acts like I've never played it before. So extremely sad and upset because I really enjoyed playing!
Bought, on, steam, Bought this game on steam then on moblie. Let me say. STILL AN AWESOME GAME! I see a lot of changes and some quest are missing for moblie oh well. BUY THE GAME! ITS WORTH IT! I love it! WISH Dev will make more games.

support, as, whole, I know this was on Xbox first. But it still sets a high bar for what mobile games could be. Comprehensive game mechanics that support the experience as a whole, no advertisements, no microtransactions. Without cheap gimmicks, u have to rely on the playing experience alone to sell the game. And I think it this game does just fine in that regard. Even if Life Sims like these aren't ur cup of tea, mobile gamers can still appreciate the straightforward gameplay design with no flash. Devs, take note.

waiting, for, Time, Edited: Hahaha now I bought a new better phone for gaming and 1 thing for sure.. I'll be waiting for your next 'My Time at Sandrock!' Your game is Lit!üî•
work, for, game, Excellent port of a great game. It would be nice to have customizable mobile controls, but they do work rather well for a 3D mobile game and this point will be moot when they add controller support.
consuming, for, weeks, Beautiful game and well worth the money! Thank you for consuming all my free time for the last few weeks, and for the foreseeable future! 10/10 A++
hunted, down, people, I can't turn in commissions. I completed 2 commissions and I practically hunted down the people to turn in the commissions to them, but there is no way to turn them in even after talking to them. I have the items in my inventory and idk how to get them to the person because it gives no option to give it to them. EDIT: this was happening because I still had a main quest to complete. Sorry about that

play, with, pace, Great game with tons of features, fun activities, interesting stories, and long play time hours. Because this is an offline game, we can play with our own pace, yeay! In default, we are focusing to become a great builder and run our workshop, but it doesn't limit you to focus on other things like become a friends, harvesting, fishing, ruin diving, and many more. This is one of the best game in Android, the price is so cheap compared to what you can get. Thanks developers and publisher!

keeping, after, mark, Decent port, interesting enough to keep you hooked for 10-20 hours, but you hardly will have any interest in keeping playing after that time mark. Let's not even talk about finishing the game. After a while that game just become a resource management simulator, where you got wait ridiculously long times for each item to craft, just to make the game artificially longer.

started, without, expectatiom, Haven't loved any mobile games more! I started without much expectatiom, and blinked, then, miraculously, more than 80 hours spent on the game! I do not think I am at the half of the game yet because I just play very leisurely. Chopping woods, chatting up specific npcs, dating two, breaking up with one and marrying the other. I feel really attached to the game and frantically am trying to find a replacement for the future. Urgh. Hard.

get, for, hours, I don't know how to describe this, but this is one of the best games I've ever played. You get hooked for hours once you start playing. Also it doesn't overheart my phone, and there are endless things to do there with no money grabbing at all

keeps, to, standards, I get bored easily after consistently playing a game for a certain amount of time. This game really keeps up to its standards. It never fails to keep me intrigued! I'm obsessed with its storyline and the probability of exploring more than just the town. This game is the best rpg simulation I have ever played. Worth every penny!

ran, across, farm, the first time i picked up a chicken and ran across the farm for the other ducks and chicks to follow me so everyone can beat me the f up was hilarious... but still too laggy for my phone a good samsung version, a galaxy a21s, but i do can play it on the tablet... when ever this game feels more smooth for my android mobilephone device then you will be getting 5 stars but for now the game is awesome just this lag i be getting on my phone

do, on, ride, Okay this game is actually kinda üî•! One of the most in depth mobile games I've ever played, and it doesn't do any money grabbing. Perfect thing to do on a plane ride. I have a suggestion for the devs. The inventory system is incredibly annoying: Don't require that an item is in the backpack in order to complete quests, commissions, selling at shops, gifting, etc. And don't require that an item is in the quick bar to cook with it. Just show whatever cooking items you own. Would be much better!

lags, on, tablet, This game has so much promise, but it lags badly on my Samsung tablet in just a short time even with game boosting. I am afraid I got tired of this problem and ended up Uninstaller. Perhaps I wi.l try this game again in the future.

run, on, Android, Remarkable port of the PC version and almost all current updates as well. This hasn't just been forced to run on Android this has been very well adapted for controls, quality of life and GUI usability.

plays, on, mobile, This game plays great on mobile, in my opinion. I played this game on Xbox One, and liked it, but it was very buggy. It looked like the bugs I was having issues with were resolved on mobile, so I'll play it on here from now on :)

finished, in, days, One of the best game out there today for a very low price and the bugs i encountered seems to be fixed. I finished the game in 167 days. Play this game and you will never regret it.
added, On, update, It was Goood, But I hope the controller support will be added On the Next update
wait, for, support, can't wait for controller support
released, on, android, Will my time at sandrock be released on android?
play, on, Note, I've just started playing this but my first impression of the game is impressive. I play on a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and so far the game runs smooth. Not being a mobile gamer I was skeptical if I would like the game controls compared to a game controller, and again, I'm highly impressed how easy the controls are. I will update my review once I have played more extensively.

need, to, multiplayer, Nice awesome game but no multiplayer game why .. need to multiplayer and 1 or 2 players together play this game need
bummed, about, it, Dont have a laptop or computer to play. I was really bummed out about it. When i saw this, i was so happy. Its been a blast playing it. I havent put it down since i bought. Totally worth the price. üòç
played, for, minutes, I tried to load up the game several times, causing it to crash almost every time. When it was finally open, I was greeted by the most horrifying playable character I've ever seen. I was shocked, even the Wild Thornberries are ugly in a charming way. The game, graphically speaking, just feels unfinished. Most terrain is just a flat, textureless plane. I only played for a few minutes before chickening out. The voice acting is charming though, and rather different from most games, which I liked.
ignore, due, credit, No, I stole my dad credit carrier prepaid just to buy this, I want a refund ! My dad knew but he just ignore it due to his credit has been deducted stealthily. Ah, better getting this game at a half price. Tbh, I want support you just bcs I managed to mod this game meshes + it is in the phone now(Regarding to mod, don't worry I will not share anything public if it breaks the T&C). Fyi, most prepaid credit(include his) can't withdraw into the bank so I made up to buy this game :') Sad story end.

reverted, like, day, Game itself is good, but there's a gamebreaking bug. I was getting out of the house and suddenly the game is reverted like day 1 with all the items intact. So i closed the game and the save file cant be opened. Honestly this is a terrible bug it makes you lose all your progress. It happens for the second time

played, on, account, I love this game! I played it originally on my husband's steam account, so naturally excited when I could download it on my Chromebook. However, it hasn't worked since day one. I can't even get a refund! This game has never loaded, so I haven't been able to play it! Extremely disappointed! Complete Garbage!!!!

get, past, day, I love the game but it's practically impossible to get past a day. The game constantly crashes even though my system is up to date and my ram is more than ok. It's on the lowest setting possible and literally sucks at running.
load, to, phone, Does NOT cloud save or allow transfer to new devices. I learned this the hard way after my phone broke and I attempted to load my saved game to my new phone. Progression I this game is hard earned and requires a lot of time, the fact that it's all lost if something happens to your device makes the game not worth playing.

launch, past, character, I'm sad that I can't seem to launch the game past the character set up. It crashes after I create my character. Also it's very difficult to change the character name because I can't get the keyboard to pop up. Only after fiddling with it for way longer than I care to admit was I able to get the keyboard to appear. Way too much time and effort to create a character only to have it crash and disappear.

loved, for, years, I have loved this game for 2 years now and I'm so glad it's on mobile! The mobile port is very well done and the developers fix bugs quite fast. My Time at Portia is a wholesome game where you can live your life as a builder, befriend townspeople, explore the vast open world, and do quests that enhance gameplay and progress the story of the game. I'd say it's well worth my money. Definitely my favorite game.

waiting, for, outfit, Hey hey! I'm waiting for the npc's outfit. Hope the devs added them sooner..
compared, to, platforms, I am super glad I downloaded this mobile version. I was at first concerned that the controls would be noticably bad compared to the other platforms, but the controls are actually managable. Every so often I do see flickering when I move, but it's not bad enough to make me stop playing. That's really my only reason for not giving a 5th star.
gets, on, mobile, The game is one of the best mobile games I have ever played hope it gets more popular on mobile
seems, in, settings, this game is phenomal!!!!! i cant let my phone down playing this game and i already played 210+ hours!! but sadly im using a low end device thats why even in the lowest settings seems laggy. devs could you please adjust the graphics, i suggest in-game option for more lower graphics for low-end devices so that we can play less laggy. pls! i really like this game so much. hope you will take note my suggestion PS: Please make also a mobile platform of MY TIME AT SANDROCK that can play also offline.
used, to, them, I've always wanted to play this but my laptop couldn't run it, it was a potato with a keyboard. Now that it's on mobile I can actually play it! The controls were kinda hard to understand at first, but I'm used to them now. I LOVE this game!!!
play, for, PC, So I've always wanted to play this game for PC. To find out suddenly not only is it mobile now but also $7.99? I jumped at the chance and am now having a great gaming experience. With all the content I'm discovering I can't foresee running out of things to do in the game anytime soon.

go, to, inventory, Every time I assemble the stone furnace and retrieve it, it does not go to my inventory. I make sure to have lots of extra space in my inventory but still no luck. Restarted game, restarted phone, doesn't work. Can't advance at all since this is a key build for the first few quests. Super disappointed - a game you pay for should actually work.

crashes, after, update, The game crashes after the recent update. Crashes at 1st loading screen, changing scene, etc while it didnt happen for me in the previous patch.

let, into, ruins, Won't let me into old ruins 2 will just keep loading nonstop and Won't go in
pays, to, it, Its like a dream come true - lots of freedom and a HUGE amount of content, not to mention the devs pays attention to it (even its offline) and care to fix bugs. Definitely a must-try if you like harvest moon-style game!
go, to, sleep, Keeps crashing/freezing . I'm on year 4 and since I got the factory I can't even do a full day. The game doesn't save so I am sick of repeating things and then losing them again. i have to go to sleep after a few game hours have passed if I want to make sure it saves. Its a shame because i have loved playing it so far üò¢
match, with, sound, Great game. But the game has a glitch with Dr.Xu dialogue doesn't match with sound, hope Dev. Fix this issues üòâ
playing, on, phone, Better experience playing this on my phone than my Nintendo DS! I love this game and any glitches since I began playing have been quickly resolved.

wish, for, things, Ok, now that I've finished the whole game I can give final review: Overall a decent game of this genre, however the game feels unpolished to me, doesn't offer much replay value. Not enough decorative items for house and yard, no different play style, restarting to get some of the romance exclusive items isn't worth the time, once the main mission concluded nowhere to spend all the gol. I wish for things to do post game. P.S. Why the fish tanks don't show number of fish inside? Add that please.
release, at, sandrock, Already finished the game, i think i played it too fast, im waiting more update for continuing main mission like the comeback of Aadit, or just release My time at sandrock on android too, i will gladly buy the game too since i like it
played, on, PC, My time is a LONG game there will easily be over 100 hours play time so the price is a steal. I played it on PC but have been commuting and needed to pass time. I am impressed it is the full game. Great game for anyone into open world like Stardew Valley. I didn't like the many of the default settings. I recommend turning down the passage of time in the options menu for the cellphone since it is a multi tasking device. I gave it 5 because I am happy it is on the phone.

compared, to, launch, Edit 2: The game is in a great state now compared to the initial launch. Most glitches are fixed and a lot more graphics options are added. Overall this is a great port, a must buy for all those who love farming simulation games (although this is more of a workshop simulation, lol)

playing, in, game, To give 5 star .. I recommend that I can change my look except colouring hairstyle mouth etc .. Also please add button or item that can change my name after playing long term in game like I can change My house name .. make this game global because this game the only type of harvest moon that have massive graphic and design .. Thank you overall it's good .. I give 5 star if have change name. I'm to tired to start all from beginning just to change my name or my character look lol ..
Remind, of, Factory, Remind me of Rune Factory and Harvest Moon, but BETTER. So many interact action with NPC. Refreshing mining game play and so much mini games. Easy to play. Many save slot and can be uploaded to cloud data. The map are so wide. Interesting storyline. I really recommended this game, it's worth to play
went, to, commerce, Good game but have some big issue. I went to guild commerce and the game just froze and ui clash, no matter how many times i restart and load my last save whenever i go inside guild commerce the game just froze and ui clash. Good game!! but i can't play it anyway 2star till the dev fix this issue. My device: Samsung galaxy S10+

having, with, this, I'm having a lot of fun with this!
mining, with, joystick, Very enjoyable and chill game, It would be nicer if i could rotate my character while mining with the right joystick or be able to just tap on furnace to open instead having to accurately rotate my character to be straight to be able to open stuff.

based, on, capability, The latest update allows me to modify my settings based on my phone capability. I could now run the 60 fps with balanced setting well. I kinda get a problem with getting overheating easily as well as the game consumes my battery quickly. But the game is still fine.

going, in, workshop, Hello, this game is one of my favorites so far but now that I have lots of things going on in my workshop (having lots of furnaces in action) the game became laggy (only when I'm at my workshop). If I step outside the gate the game will become smooth again, but the moment I enter the gate that's when the game starts lagging. My phone has 8gb of ram, 128gb of storage and has a snapdragon 720G processor. I hope you can find a way to fix this, thank you!

I cleaned my phone from games that i really love just to play this game but it's still not enough. Please consider my suggestion for the sake of low specs cp users like me. TY for this game and i hope you'll see this.

toggle, on, right, I love it, but one thing annoy me please remove the front camera view toggle on the right, thanks!
playing, on, PC, Loved playing this on PC, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it on mobile. The only thing I can think of that would make it just that much better is having the ability to use a gaming controller with it, my hand was starting to cramp up the other night due to how long I had been holding my phone in an awkward position for so long while playing. Otherwise it's exactly like the PC version and I'm super happy with it.

wait, for, Time, Best game ever! Can't wait for My Time at Sandrock!
make, because, attack, amazing. .one suggestion if developer can make customized HUD because sometime misclick attack and jump button. .awesome game
finding, during, sequence, Essentially perfect, although I would dearly love controller support. That said the mobile screen controls are pretty good, although finding the pickup button during the airship drop sequence made it hard to collect gifts before other characters grabbed them. You get a lot of game for your money too. If you're a fan of stuff like Stardew Valley this is a no-brainer. Also looks *great* and keeps up a solid 30fps mostly (on Pixel 4)

regarding, with, Petra, The bug regarding with Petra can't be spoken has been fixed. Just have to reload my older save. Means I have to redo my whole day. But it's ok cause now I can continue my missions. I just have a concern regarding the system messages. It shows and vanish so fast that I have no time to read it and its also so small. Specially if its an event reminder like calendar event or playdate reminder. Please make the fonts bigger and shows longer.
Looking, for, game, I love this kind of game so much. Looking forward for the developer's next game, My Time at Sandrock. I couldn't play on pc so I hope they'll port it to mobile version too. I don't mind spending money to support this developer. Thank you for porting this game to mobile!

working, in, game, Everything was working fine in the game... Until I became pregnant, I gave birth without knowing, there were no cut scenes of me in the hospital, I received a bunch of notifications that I didn't feed the baby and my baby is NOWHERE to be found, I've searched everywhere and the baby doesn't show up anywhere but I keep getting notifications that I didn't feed the baby..... HELP. And I'm super sad I didn't see the scene of my child's birth, what an awful bug.

play, on, device, the game is good but why the cloud save interface so confusing? I accidentally deleted my saves - when the daily save is newer then the game should remove the older auto-save one. i needed to delete the older autosave and then bam!! ALL my saves disappeared!! also when u want to play on another device such as bluestack - why does it not auto load? why do i have to upload my saves to cloud everytime? I don't understand these things please someone help!!

download, on, mate, When I download this game on Huawei mate, the character voice is gone.
restart, over, game, Please delete the poluting water - rat king quest in the sewer, really iritating. The problem can't be solved , is it a bug? Probably i just gonna restart over the game and just ignore the main quest to enjoy the game.
play, in, voiceovers, The game is very good and I'm loving it so much! I just wish they have an option for CN voiceovers soon. I would really like it if I can play it in CN voiceovers!
own, on, pc, I own this game on my pc, switch and mobile now. But i have issues with cloud saving, i wanted to upload my progress to cloud but it doesn't detect my current local data.
continue, without, problem, despite having lost 8 days of gameplay due to save files problem, I managed to replay the game and return to my 8 days state in just 2-3 days so I guess it's cool, and 5 stars because bugs were fixed and I managed to continue quests without any problem like quests not triggering and such. Great game overall.
socialize, with, NPCs, Smooth gameplay, great storyline, graphics is not so bad. This game is more story-focused where you'll receive missions one after another, however it also gives players freedom to explore the world, do commissions and socialize with NPCs. Similar concept like other popular simulation games. If you're a fan of simulation games, you'll love this game. However this game is more inclined towards calm and relaxing nature, it's not for everyone. If you preferred action RPG, this is not for you.
drop, from, fps, Could use another fix. Just at complete random the game will decide it is time to drop from 60 fps to a locked 22 fps. My Samsung galaxy note 20 ultra shows it can handle this game at 60 fps anywhere in the game but the game refuses to allow full gpu usage. My metrics only show about 43% gpu usage to get 60 fps on highest settings. Could you fix this for a more stable 60? Even restarting the game doesn't help. My phone isn't even close to hot.

Make friends with EVERYONE in Portia? Speedrun the game in 7 hours of gameplay? 150 hours of gameplay? Complete the solo experience on your own accord.

loved, on, PC, I loved this game on PC and I'm really happy they made a mobile version. It's a mix of farming, building, fishing, and some hack and slash. The graphics and story are wonderful. As with games like this, I think it would hard/impossible to play on a small/weaker phone but it plays beautifully on my Samsung 21. I'll agree with others that the texts can be hard to read especially with the color scheme. It seems like bugs are getting fixed fairly quickly. Just buy it!

reminds, of, moon, This is the first time i played the series. it reminds me of harvest moon a lot. never thought i played it in a long run. the portability of the games on smartphone even make it great i can play it anytime and load the games anywhere.

release, on, android, I'm Addicted and I'm so happy that it release on android! Thank you!üíï. I'm kinda expect the grass will be the same like on Steam, so I'm a little bit annoyed especially how the grass is a little bit taller than the characters. Aside from that love it! keep it up!
recommend, to, game, A great game! A must play if you want a game with a great storyline and adventure. I do recommend anyone to this game. I hope My Time at Sandrock will have a mobile version aswell!

stuck, at, Login, UPDATE: The most recent game update caused the game to lag when walking or running around strangely. I reinstalled and discovered I lost everything!! So at first there was an issue that prevented playing due to getting stuck at the Google Play Games Login and devs fixed it straight away without hesitation, kudos and thanks so much! Upon starting a New Game I'm greeted with a beautiful game that has great customization, audio, visuals, and lots of fun things to do!

looking, towards, towncenter, Seems to be a decent port with good controls and ui, however there are significant fps drops on Samsung galaxy s21 (exynos 2100). I would be grateful if it could be optimized a bit more or provide options to fine tune the graphics. The low preset just looks unpleasant and takes some magic away from the game. Edit : 60 fps has been added. Performance is much better now but there are still fps drops at night or when looking towards the towncenter. Nonetheless, I am updating my review to 5 stars.

allow, with, fps, Thanks for the reply, but uh my phone's RoG Phone 2. I'd be really happy if you allow my phone with 60 fps or even 120 fps available. Thanks in advance, devs!
took, at, place, I have found bug when you took photo twice at the same place it will pop up notification that to overwrite the collection but i can't to confirm or cancel it.please fix this:)
Played, on, xbox, Played it on the xbox ah now the convenience at my finger tip, still lovely enjoyable game
stick, in, place, Amazing experience so far. So many things to do/create and the AI that let NPCs not stick in one place makes it more fun to play. They don't have to be at the shop to sell/buy items. I'm not really fan of mobile games because of the controlling on screen but this game worth the shoulder pain üòÇ
optimized, on, device, Really smooth and it feels really optimized on a sd 870 device!
buy, in, pc, Good Job!!! Top tier game for a life stimulation. Im a big fan of harvest moon in ps. Its really great that we have this game in mobile. I really want to buy it in pc but a little expensive for me. Hoping that it can match what on pc platform. Looking forward for better updates.

played, on, PC, I love My Time at Portia since i played it on PC. I remembered i spent 400 hours on the pc part. Now the game is on mobile, it's like a portable workshop come to my hand. There are some bug here and there, yet i'm happy the interface are clean. The only drawback here are it's unable to load my save game from pc counterpart. I really hope in the future they implement this, just like Stardew valley.

Even i never paid for premium game before, but this game was exception, and it's worth!!, I love this game, so much freedom, no ads, no additional paying, the world and the town design was amazing!!!!! You can explore everywhere, do everything, mining, farming, crafting, fishing, and many more.. I love the vibe of this game, so calm, relaxing.. Keep up the good work dev!!!

Thank, for, port, Thank you so much for such a great port of the game to Android. The game runs almost with no flaws or drop in fps when I played.It's wonderful. However,I experienced problem with the controls. When I press the joystick pad for around 1-5 minutes, the arrow usually got stuck on one place and my character will keep walking/running to the wall or sometime into the water.In most case, I'd open the map or inventory to get rid of it.But it happen so many times.I turned off auto sprint but still happen

When I press the joystick pad for around 1-5 minutes, the arrow usually got stuck on one place and my character will keep walking/running to the wall or sometime into the water.In most case, I'd open the map or inventory to get rid of it.But it happen so many times.I turned off auto sprint but still happen

Love, since, version, Love this game since pc version, but it would be better if the android version have a controller support.
stuck, on, screen, I had to delete then reinstall due to being stuck on the loading screen for 2 days straight. It restarted my progress. I've given it another go though , I enjoy this game quite a bit.

got, on, steam, I do love this game, got it on steam and on my switch, so it was also a must have for my mobile. Until now I have just a few Problems a) my characters lips look a bit weird, makes her look as if she had tusks in her lower jaw. b) the sprint key is in a bad position, I read a complain that someone had trouble not to sprint all the time; I have trouble to use sprint at all c) The "Sort All" option doesn't work, pressing the key does nothing at all.

playing, for, days, I'm really enjoying that this game is open world and that there isn't ads or additional costs once bought. However after I'd playing for 3 days and making a fair amount of progress the game froze and my Samsung UI failed. I had to do a soft reset on my phone. When opening the app again it remained frozen so I deleted it and reinstalled it. My game data hadn't saved properly despite saving to the cloud. The most recent save was from the 1st day of playing. Really annoying. Please fix this issue.

slide, to, direction, Controls a bit laggy. Sometime stuck to one direction and cannot slide it to the direction i desire. Except that, all perfect.
Done, for, Game, The Freezing Issue has been fixing and i can play it Smoothly, Well Performance, Well Service Response, Well Done for amazing Game.
Runs, with, option, Great game and very nice port! I typically despise virtual gamepads, but this works really well. Layout is intuitive. Runs smoothly with any graphics option on my Note 20 Ultra. Knocked out about 24% of my battery over 1.5 hrs so it does suck up some juice. However, this isn't too surprising (nor that bad) considering the graphics. Overall, definitely a worthy purchase. I got it on sale, but its easily worth full price.

keeps, on, loading, It just keeps on loading and not opening Edit: from 1 to 5 stars, great game, great graphics, great gameplay, very addictive. F2p. Hope it becomes multiplayer later on. Keep up the good work.

optimized, for, mobile, Always patch this game to become most stable and optimized for mobile. you should add 60fps or fps unlocked
use, with, games, Good port. Just wish there was controller support so it would be a bit easier to use since I have big hands and a small phone. So I use a mobile controller with most games that I can.
enter, to, Guild, I like this game, but whan I enter to Commercial Guild it's stuck.
have, on, platforms, I would rate this 5 star but because it does not support controller support I feel it should only be 3, I will change if or when it does support controller. I have this on all platforms and kickstarted sandrock so I am a massive fan but I do feel let down as been waiting for mobile port since day dot and the touch detect my thumbs correctly. Please sort this out.

have, on, One, Fantastic port of a game üôÇ have this on Xbox One since day of release and now also on mobile. So far cannot fault the game, they have made it simple to play and adapted it well to Mobile with the save feature on exiting the game via menu and the map being able to put a marker down and automatically running there. These are two awesome features.

looking, for, game, Amazing game so far. I was looking for a farming game that is not the usual plant and log out thing and this seems to be it, with relationships and places to explore. Love the graphics, the calm atmosphere and the multitude of details. The quests/commissions are just complex enough to hold your attention. I am only on day 5, so I can't say too much about how it progresses as a game, but so far everything is going great. Looking forward to exploring this world which promises to be intriguing.

works, with, moto, Good game, works with my old moto g5s plus
played, on, PC, It's def worth the money. Runs well. The controller isn't really needed. Good port having played it on PC first. It has a reasonable downgrade in graphics for a phone game. But it looks great with the cartoon look on a 6.5ish inch screen.

paid, for, game, This game could be so good, but the lag times, freezing, and force closes are unbearable. I paid for this game, and I can't really play it because of this. It's really frustrating.

play, on, phone, This is awesome...finally I can play on my phone.
unlock, in, updates, Awesome porting from PC! Hey dev, can you make this game run 60fps or higher? I think 30fps did not enough üòÉ And also maybe in future updates, the other maps will unlock right?
flickering, with, silhouette, My only problem is the glitch on graphics. The town floor is flickering with green silhouette. If you would kindly fix this. Thank you.
releasing, for, mobile, Perfect game just like on pc version.Well minor is only battery drain.Price is cheap same as pc version.Very worthed u can have all fun like build,socializing petting,riding,farming,fishing,dungeon battle,adventure.etc.One buy no IAP and gacha.Thx for releasing this awesome game for mobile.
synced, with, Xbox, Love game but wish it synced with Xbox... But definitely a great game on mobile too!
play, on, mobile, Great job Pathea & Nuverse Ive enjoyed this game since it was on PC. Im glad you make it possible to play on mobile.
carried, to, guild, Hi I found a bug. When I finished making the Dee Dee transport and carried it to the commerce guild for the commission my game froze as soon as I entered the room. I have restarted my phone, I redid the day more than five times now but it still freezes when I enter the guild. What should I do? I'm rating this five star because it's a good game but I can't continue the game if my it keeps on freezing.

relaxing, at, time, The overall gameplay was excellent it was engaging and relaxing at the same time, i just so happen to encounter a problem with the inspection mini game at the commerce guild, everytime ypu enter the commerce guild the game freeze and force the game to close or restart the phone entirely. I do hope the developers address this issue.
start, during, weekends, After doing a lot of testing for this commerce guild freeze issue. Just found out that it will start freezing and crashing after day 20 (any season) during weekends consistently. I'm around level 13-15.

get, with, solution, My relic scanner does not work properly. The gold orbs that are supposed to appear do not. I have tried everything. This means I can't progress any further. I really love this game but this has spoiled it for me. Can you please get back to me with a solution?
note, in, creation, This is a great game! It's almost a perfect port from the PC version. I would note in character creation the models lips look broken. Besides that I haven't seen any other errors! Would love some more customization options though!

works, on, phone, A beautiful port of a wonderful game. If you like crafting simulation games like Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, Rune factory 4 or Dragon Quest Builders, you'll love this game too. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to support all devices - namely chromebooks. Runs and works great on my phone (4G RAM) but doesn't even get to the loading screen on my chromebook (16G RAM). Definitely worth every penny if you have the hardware to run it but can't give it an unreserved recommendation right now.

combining, with, gameplay, My 3rd playthrough combining with PC gameplay. The transition is smooth so far with actually an amazing control. You know I found this developer is passionate with the game and it is worth it to support them. Cant wait for first time at sandrock.

loaded, for, hour, I have loaded for one hour ! But could not start. What a waste
runs, on, S, I had low expectations of this, since it's a ported console game, but it blew my expectations out of the water! It's every bit as good as the console versions, and runs perfectly on my Galaxy S 20.
change, to, stars, I like this game but my character's mouth looks really weird, and it's quite distracting. It makes the cut scenes with my character look so odd. I will change this to 5 stars if the mouth gets fixed.
keeps, on, freezing, It is a really nice game at first but now it keeps on freezing. I tried restarting the game and my phone as well but it is still the same. Please fix it!!! I really like this game.
stayed, in, loading, It stayed in loading... I didn't even get a chance to play the game. :-(
prefer, over, version, Great game. Great Port. I actually prefer this over Xbox version. However, it needs controller support. I can't use my Razer Kishi android controller with this game. 5 stars if I could.

play, at, pace, Pretty solid game, fun and you can play the game at your own pace. the only problem is that there is no controller setting, I can't use my ipega gamepad :( glad the touch control is really good, but still connecting to my gamepad would be blast

rains, in, game, Game runs great on huawei p30 pro however I noticed that precipation effect doesn't show when it rains in game. You can see dark clouds, thunder sound but not precipation sound and it's not visible. It doesn't even show on highest graphic settings so hope it can be patched as there is precipation effect option and it does nothing to change anything in game. Anyway the game is really fun, controls are well thought out and should run great on similar phones that I have.

save, on, device, Edited : I meant save on the same mobile device not bring my switch save to my mobile. I'll check to make sure it's saved then when I close the game out it deletes the whole thing. I don't think leaving on In background should be answer but it feels like the only way to go.

come, to, me, The game is beautiful but I think I spotted a bug or maybe unclear instructions, there is a mini game called roping, no matter what I do, animals don't come to me and I lose the rope... I suggest having a tutorial for these mini games better than instructions that are unclear... 3 stars now, please fix my problem, consider changing events and minigames into tutorials and you'll have 5 stars...

get, in, npc, No voice acting. Unless I get voiceovers in npc then it stays 3stars. But so far this game is exciting!
get, on, mobile, An excellent mobile port. Controls is as good as it can get on mobile and so far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs. Im just glad to get another quality premium game for mobile and its worth the cheap asking price

entering, at, date, Something wrong it just me or anyone else also experienced this, it freeze when entering commerce guild at certain date in the game, it happened twice for me. the first time i just reload my game in the bed and skip the entire day without entering the commerce guild, and the next day it's normal. But these issues still there for the second time it freeze again. Well sure it will kill the mood if it happened again, reload my game and avoid the day without entering the commerce guild.

looking, for, update, Love this life sim game. But this port is a bit unpolished for my liking like font is too small for sub 6" phone display, map is cluttered for a small screen device and, also the game is a bit laggy and unoptimised. Am looking forward for future update.
fades, to, screen, Unable to play. Allows me to make character and fades to black screen
come, to, mobile, Its nice to see this game come to mobile. I'm kind of getting tired of the typical "mobile" game which always feels hollow. This game is exactly like the pc version. The controls feel good and it works well on my S10+.

supported, on, mobile, Controller support is still missing. Can't fully recommend it as of yet. It is fun on console though. Will give five stars if and when controllers are supported on mobile too.
manage, than, versions, I find the mobile version to be easier to manage than the console and PC versions. This is great!
loved, from, get, I loved this game from the get go on Nintendo switch. So as you can imagine my face when I see this absolutely beautiful game in the app store üòç ü•≤ lol. It's a very relaxing slice of life game with stunning graphics and accompanied with beautiful music that really sets the tone. There really is lots to do in here from fishing, gathering, mining, crafting, upgrading, fighting and socialising with the NPC's even play rock, paper, scissors to build relationships and ultimately fall in love. Enjoy.

There really is lots to do in here from fishing, gathering, mining, crafting, upgrading, fighting and socialising with the NPC's even play rock, paper, scissors to build relationships and ultimately fall in love. Enjoy.
have, in, mobilr, Great game to have in mobilr and in steam. I font know where to get energy though. Fighting a lvl 30 NPC was a blast (lvl 1)
smeared, on, characters, The game started off good, but as soon as I created my character, I was kicked out of the app, and I kept getting kicked out whenever I tried to continue the game. The lipstick looked smeared on the characters, and just in the character creator my battery drained quickly. I was really excited for this to be a mobile game, since I loved the Xbox and PC versions.

played, on, PC, I've played this on the PC and loved it and now I'm so glad it's on mobile so I can play anywhere. Literally hours and hours of things to do. Graphics are great, the voice acting is new since I last played and enhances the game. Runs great on the Samsung Note20 People moaning about the price, you get what you pay for and it's probably one of the most involved mobile game available at this time. No ads, no video rewards or waiting on energy .

looking, for, experience, Warning if Your looking for a multiplayer experience do not buy this game other then that the story, graphics,combat is so fluent and perfected even to the way you can navigate thru. Items and be able to follow things your trying to make with a simple drag it's a system I wish most sandbox rpgs would follow

love, for, it, A fantastic port of the PC version! This is my 4th copy (PC, XB1, switch and now this) and I'm thrilled with the mobile game. Especially love the new save feature for it, I'd like to see that added on my other copies tbh. Definitely worth the $. The only "downside" is it does drain my battery, but most big mobile games do, so nbd.

waiting, for, someone, Very very good!! This kills my boredome wherever om travelling or waiting for someone. This makes me play nonstop even charging. This game is brilliant!!
playing, on, xbox, Personally i think games with mechanics like this are going to be hard with a button layout. But from playing previously on xbox and pc it became so easy i can play with one hand for most things, mining is a bit weird though.... otherwise great game

love, like, moon, Really good game. I love this game, like harvest moon
waitting, on, update, Good. Just waitting on optimization update.
supported, with, gamepad, Waiting to be supported with generic gamepad
Played, on, console, Really fun game. Played it on console and really hype that it's on mobile. It runs really well for a mobile version.

has, from, aspect, This is one of those games where you will really get your money's worth with how much gameplay and content this has. I'm surprised that apart from its simulation aspect, it also has some rpg elements like monster fighting and skill point distribution. It's easy to learn and play, although loading screens take a few seconds to load, it's not too bad. It's also playable offline so that alone makes this a great purchase for me. Looking forward to future updates! Congrats on the game release!

brainstorming, in, order, Really good graphics, nice storyline and really needs brainstorming in order to solve things. Me and my husband both enjoy playing it so much. Worth the money and hoping to see more great future content! ‚ô°
playing, on, Xbox, Loved playing this on Xbox now I can play it anywhere
Looks, like, moon, Looks like harvest moon, a little bit clich√© but i think i play more to see what you guys bring to audience

happens, to, both, This is surprisingly good! The controls are pretty intuitive and easy, and I think this version is more generous with items (like during mining) than the PC or PS4 versions. It does get my phone pretty hot and drains the battery rather quickly, which is why I removed a star. I have a Galaxy S8+ and a Note 9 and the heat/drain happens to both. If that can be remedied, then I'd be completely happy with this version.
load, for, me, The game won't even load for me I'm stuck on the loading screen.
exist, in, android, My best game ever exist in android so far
coming, from, console, This is actually a great port. Controls take some getting used to if you're coming from console or PC. Love the graphics.
open, on, Chromebook, I love the Switch game, bugs and all (which is why this version got even three stars) but it wouldn't open on my Chromebook (I have the android emulator installed and successfully run other Android games, so that's not the issue). I got a refund (but very disappointed because I really love this game).
talk, to, someone, I was lookin forward to this game being mobile but its lagging when i move or talk to someone
expected, for, mobile, About what i expected for mobile though there are a couple graphical issues. The mouths seem to be colored oddly as they seem to have smeared lipstick. Also sometimes the voice acting seems fuzzy for the second female voice. I'm on a tab s7+. But even with the issues still enjoyable.
waited, for, this, Ive waited for this,i love this game since on pc and now i can play it portable on my phone ,The only problem im experiencing is when i first open the game its kinda laggy

happened, to, some, earlier having hard time to login cause of google play issues and it happened to some of us but thank you for fixing it. I could be able to play it today and it run smoothly on my phone. the colour tone is good, it made the graphics even better. so far I didnt find the bugs. Thank you for the benefit, got some rewards like outfit and stuff, and also could be able to hear Paulie's voices (which I never heard before on console), so im hoping not much bugs -or none- in the future.

changing, to, drains, Wanted to love this but can't. Graphics are good but even changing to the lowest setting battery drains too fast. Controls are impossible for larger phones or people with smaller hands. Playing this on a tablet will be impossible. This game should have really been reduced better for mobile.

laying, on, pc, The only bug I encountered is the Google play games login bug. The control fells great and the visual is almost as close as what you get when wp laying it on pc. I already this is going to be great as the controls are well converted to mobile. Good job devs.

connect, to, google, I can't connect to google, keep loading. But, yeah recommend this game!
connect, to, account, 4 stars for now. My gaming is smooth so far. However, I cannot connect it to my google play account. Hoping this will be fixed asap.
runs, on, mobile, Amazing port of an amazing game! Looks and runs beautifully on mobile, and plays really well too! If you're a fan of farming RPGs (Stardew, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, Etc), definitely give this one a go. Dungeon crawling, crafting, relationships, exploration, it's all here and all wonderful. This is my preferred way to play the game and I recommend it to anyone interested in the title!

Worked, with, controller, Really good port. Worked fine with my Xbox one controller, but the touch controls look and feel really good. Also having the play games connection issue, but just press outside the dialogue to close it. Devs will fix that soon enough

beat, on, PC, Wish there was an option for 60fps but I do appreciate the widescreen support. This is one of the best bang for your buck games. 100 hours for me to beat the campaign on PC.
connect, to, games, You can't connect to Google play games and the characters look like they have lipstick smeared all over their mouths but if you can look past that, it's a pretty decent crafting game.
