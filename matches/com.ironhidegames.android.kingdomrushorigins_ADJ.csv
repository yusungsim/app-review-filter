feel, chaotic, Doesn't seem as fun as the original. But so far so good üëå The hero mechanics are better and the game graphics look better. I feel the chaotic feel is missing. Not sure what, but it's missing some variable from first game

rating, higher, Love the series. Would've had a higher rating if it weren't for the money grab. You pay for the game and just get the basics even if you grind really hard it'll take forever to purchase a top rank champion. I paid for the entire game let me experience the entire game.

fan, huge, Ah, I really wanted to like this game, but... it just wasn't my taste :/ I loved the original Kingdom Rush, so I'm pretty sad that this one didn't live up to my expectations. For some reason, the colours seem too garish, the stage layouts often look cluttered & confusing, and I'm not a huge fan of the towers in this version. But the dealbreaker for me has to be the amount of spiders üò≠ The original had spiders too, but as an arachnophobe, the Mactans level was a nightmare. Couldn't finish it üò≠
game, kingdom, It seems every kingdom Rush game on Android is the same you only get half the experience after paying to download, the rest is locked via 60$+ to get the full experience the game itself is fun but this is not good for the consumer

setup, right, KR series aren't fun at all. It's all about founding the right tower setup. You can't max upgrade your towers, just one or two in the last few waves. It's like they give us a machine gun with just 5 bullets. This is not a hard game, if you want to beat it just search for the right setup for each round. You won't have the ability to play with strategies, you will have to find THE ONE strategy and that's it.

levels, extra, Honestly I have loved playing kingdom rush. I just feel disappointed that at the extra levels they are too hard because I have only one hero so I can't keep up with the influx of enemies, my hero Mr A is tired from running to and frow! Anyways thank you for such a quality game, that is the only reason I rate it 4 stars.

time, fourth, I love all the kingdom rush games, have since i found them freshman year. I replay through all four every six months or so. After about the fourth time doing this, i went through on black Friday and bought all of the heroes/towers in most of the games, but i left out origins for some reason. I wanted to buy the full hero pack, but haven't gotten any offers in the last couple weeks, even though I've checked every day. Is there any way i could gain access to that offer so i can support more?

rush, wierdest, This is the wierdest kingdom rush, mages that fires 2 per shot, a MAGE that fires very fast but excells at single target dps, artillery that can stack 3 shots like the archmage and summons units, bladesingers that both excells at dealing damage and tanking despite its looks. Forest keepers which is only 2 units but is actually a support tower. Despite all of it its still high quality, i REALLY wonder where are the others in origins like blackburn, nivus, and the rest of the heroes in the series?

versions, other, In order to enjoy this game. You need the Google play pass. Because this version is miles harder than the other versions.

STAY AWAY from this game at all costs! You will need to spend HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of dollars to complete this game on the harder levels. Pure BS GARBAGE. A money pitüñïüèø

rush, normal, Just. Amazing, the kingdom rush franchise just gets better and better with each game (besides vengence) just like frontiers and normal ol' kingdom rush this delivers quite as well, if not better. Ironhide has a place in my heart as some of the best flash games I played back in the day and I can only hope they get better.

series, whole, The whole series is an absolute blast to play. Easily one of the most amazing and well made tower defence games out there. Each game has a distinct feel. There is replayability with difficulty increases and always an epic sense of accomplishment with each siege successfully defended. Multiple heroes to use (or buy) with tons of unique enemies. Great animations and slick graphics. Can keep you busy for hours.

start, very, Love the gameplay from the very start. Not just a tower defense, it also has RPG element and very attractive unit&hero development. And I won the game without buying any diamond. So, for the one who said it's a pay for win game, maybe you just need to hone your skill.

rush, original, The game is great. I played the original kingdom rush and frontiers. These games are worth every penny. However here in Origins, I absolutely love all the easter eggs they left for us. Referencing stories, movies and other games. I was excited to see every level and what other little things I would spot. Excelent attention to detail. Please keep up the good work. 10/10

game, Best, Best game of the series imo. Pros: -Way more free heroes than in original game, -Graphics are definitely improved compared to other Kingdom rushes, -Very unique enemies, -Some actual story, -Great map events. Cons: -Isn't free (and this is a big con since it is a mobile game) -Doesn't take too long to finish a game. Even though there are challenges they're basically the same level with harder difficulty. Overall I'd rate this game 8/10

installment, great, Love the kingdom rush series, this is another great installment!
fun, much, I really wish y'all could update your games. This game is so much fun, but more worlds, more places, more side stories and art. More super powerful bosses. It's always so fun and it's challenging. There's a fair upgrade system and little Easter eggs, achievements, and great artwork. My only complaint is how short this game is. The levels can be completed within a week and it's disheartening to see it just finish. I know it needs to have a finish line, but the finish line is so close to the start

game, excellent, This is an excellent tower defense game. No ads, no pay to win, no annoying popups. Extremely cheap, definitely worth the money. Else you can just play thenoriginal which is free, without ads. You can easily sink 10+ hours enjoying. It doesn't really feel worth revisiting levels with highest difficulty. Maybe that can be improved in future games. Solid 9/10.

defense, best, I love all kingdoms rush games please keep making more def the best tower defense ive ever played
game, Great, Great game. 9.99/10
release, first, Very fun. Been a fan of kingdom Rush since their first release.
amount, good, Even better than the first. It's bigger, prettier, and the strategy of which towers to use and when is mixed up a good amount to keep it fresh and new. If you were only to have one game on your phone, this is it.
game, Cool, Cool game without microtransactions (if u buy google game pass)
games, only, Even better than kingdom rush These are the only two games you need on your phone
fun, Pretty, Pretty fun
game, favorite, This is my 2nd favorite Kindom Rush game from Iron hide. Really fun to play like every other kindom rush game. They should have added more game themes like snow or something. You can look at the the enimes from a book in the game and look what they can do and how much heath they have which is unique. And you can spend your stars to get upgrades for your guys.

series, fun, Very fun! best out out of he series i would highly recommend to play all the kingdom rush games!
idea, good, This is the first Kingdom Rush I played that I actually stopped playing and deleted it. Who thought it was a good idea to have levels change up the path halfway through? Or allow people to go other routes of nowhere? I get you're trying to make it different but for me personally this makes the gameplay infuriating and not fun. I worked for 12 level and now everyone can pretty much bypass the defenses? How is that fun???

one, last, Kingdom Rush is one of the better tower defense games, though I didn't enjoy it as much as their last one. One thing that was annoying; how some of the stages paths were jumbled and you wouldn't know which path to upgrade. It did add a bit of a challenge, which is good for any game worth dL-ing, but as I said, it was annoying. It'd be nice if there was a "5 more waves" option to buy with the leftover stars. On some stages, right when it gets really interesting, it's over. Good game overall.

games, best, One of the best Tower defence games out there, hands down. Love it.
games, first, Ok, so this game is basically the origin story of the first 2 games in the series (KR and Frontiers). It stayed close to the other's artstyle (which I really love) and created a really deep and interesting story. I sort of don't like the gameplay, since they switched up the towers mechanics a bit, but that's just me being picky. I'm sure you will love it just as much as I did. Oh and since people don't seem to get it: it's not pay to win. You will undeniably lose sometimes. But don't give up!

content, paid, games great but it was free and now its not but you still dont get the paid content when you buy it so its a 1 star from me dawg
balance, right, I never really got into the tower defense genre, but this completely changed my mind. It's very engaging, well thought out, just the right balance of challenge and reward. You really get the sense that your strategy worked when everything goes smooth. The heroes are also nice to upgrade and to play around with different styles of combat. The levels are a sight to behold and enemy types keep on changing appearances which keeps everything fresh.

ripoffs, many, Kingdom Rush has so many ripoffs with nearly identical gameplay because it is THE perfect formula for a tower defence game. In Origins, the new Heroes abilities are nice and otherwise it's a simple but of course highly enjoyable remix of their formula.

entry, best, (original 2017) The best entry in the Kingdom Rush Franchise! Go Elves Go!!! (2021 edit) Graphics still hold up and kinda nice. Even compared to Vengeance. Also better gameplay because branched towers is better than set of 5.

heroes, free, Another top notch TD game from Ironhide. The story is a neat prequel, the free heroes are pretty good, and it can be a good challenge. It is well balanced... unless you pay for Phoenix. This flaming bird of death is truly an AoE damage legend that can incinerate damn near anything. I enjoyed it, and consider it well worth the $3.

things, many, An amazing prequel to the Kingdom rush series! The people of Ironhide game studios have truly outdone themselves with writing, art design, and game mechanics. They added so many things that lead directly into the first game that it is genius! And they added a new hero ability mechanic which just makes the game that much more fun!

version, free, Exactly the same as the free version, but worse. Diamonds cost the same as the free version, but tower upgrades are more expensive, the enemies take more to kill, towers can be destroyed, and the refresh time is longer; meaning more diamonds will be needed. Gold bags aren't a thing. Only this stupid over-priced glove that increases gold income for a few seconds. Just stick with the free version. This base game isn't expensive, but it's paying for a worse and ultimately more expensive product

compliment, huge, So far it feels much like there original, which is a huge compliment.
characters, other, You buy the game just to discover that you payed just for 5 out of 16 characters. Want to play with other characters? Pay 5+ bucks for each! Dev, if you are gonna reply to this the way you usually do, "the game is designed so that you can finish it with the 5 characters alone", don't bother... How about I sell you a car that is perfectly drivable with just one seat, but you pay to use the other seats? TL/DR: get it on steam in full for a fraction of the price...

version, newer, It's a newer version of previous KR games, and I like the new towers powers. My only complaint remains the same: there's no fast forward button. On levels I cannot beat toward the end, 13/15, for example, I don't need to sit through the first 12 rounds. Please add this feature. It gets boring quickly when I have to sit through the same level forever just to try to beat the last two rounds.

maps, most, Excellent TD, and the ones who actually managed to be a challenge without it becoming frustrating. Getting the feel of the original. Ok, Level 10 Vez'nan trivializes most maps... But well, buying him is well worth solving the game so... üòÇ

SCAM, much, Pretty much SCAM of a game. Early levels are balanced ok even for harder difficulties but you REALLY feel the push to make you buy real money upgrades. Since it's P2P I was hoping this will be honest game. Nothing but trying to get the most money out of people. Sad

paths, new, It's okay. I just cannot get over the mechanic of enemies creating new paths leading basically to the end, or the enemies who phase around the paths and wind up near the end. It feels cheap. Oh, you didn't fortify the very end of the path? Well here comes 50 enemies who just phased around all of your defenses. Usually just ends in a restart and then prepping for it next time, but the point is it's artificial difficulty and I dislike it.

way, challenging, Love it so far! Fun and way more challenging than I was expecting. Love the art and design of it too. My only complaint is that you're expected to buy additional heros with physical money, instead of being able to earn them as you play or buy them with an in-game currency.

My only complaint is that you're expected to buy additional heros with physical money, instead of being able to earn them as you play or buy them with an in-game currency.

Since this isn't their first game, a lot little improvements make for extra fun, but without sacrificing much of the winning concepts in the earlier games.

art, clean, I love the clean art that immerses you into the game, which is much better than kingdom rush. Unfortunately, I didn't see improvements with starting new rounds since Kingdom Rush, because the button is often blocked by the escape button. But I still love this game and it's definitely worth a shot.

take, great, Really good! I actually look forward to playing this. A great fantasy-style take on the classic tower defense game. Not too challenging that you can't play casually, but not too easy that its not fun. Also has great art and design.

Never *need* to make any additional purchases beyond initial game to play through, but the option to expand choices is there for those who want some extra content. Lots of fun to be had here.

code, cheat, I was bored one night so i downloaded the first one. Not being a fan of tower defense games shows how bored I was. This game is a classic in the making. I have played the first 3 so far and its not pay to win. Sure you can buy heros but thats just buying a cheat code. All levels are easily winnable on all 3 versions I have so far, and I got max stars in the first two. Just gotta play smart. The extra heros are basically paying to cheat.

I love these games and I always will. These games are the only games I take time and review. -Ron Man

It was just like the other game just a bit different. The style that you use for the characters is one of the things I like the most. I've actually used your character design for a few drawing

person, huge, Not usually a huge tower defense person but this game is really fun. The only thing is I wish there was a confirmation pop-up before restarting or quitting.

tower, best, The rush series are perhaps the best tower defense games around, although this is the weakest in the series the visuals are washed out pastel and the gameplay adds nothing new to the previous titles.

instalment, first, Been playing Kingdom Rush since the first instalment I bumped into on Kongregate. Then it was on Android. Needless to say, I was a hardcore fan since day one and I am NOT exactly a lover of tower defense type of games. So yeah, it's that good. Props to the developers!
