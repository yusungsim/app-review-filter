is, game, good, It, It is a very good game
's, problem, only, That, The game is what you expect to buy a family surviving the apocalypse and playing the game on your phone. What I didn't expect when I brought the game is everytime when you start your game and gather supplies it would lag pretty bad. That's only problem I had and the pretty good at that point. I still don't know if it my phone or the games problem and would like to solve it.
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game I know it was made a really long time ago but I just bought like 3 weeks ago and it's like I can't stop playing it I just played it 5 hours straight.
is, fun, great, It, It is a great game fun and adventure and puzzle BUY THE GAME
was, dollars, good, That, It's ok, cool and good time killer but sometimes it can be so boring. Not only that but my brother deleted the game, I've been trying to download it ever since. It's letting me review it but either I want to be allowed to play it or at least refund me. That was a good 4 dollars.
's, part, best, That, Very fun got to think about how to survive man a lot of hard thinking sometimes to make sure you out live your other play throughs. Never know how it's going to end! That's the best part about the game very addicting in good ways! Keep the great work up!
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game! I really enjoyed it. There is a lot of endings that you can get!
was, work, fun, it, I did all the challenges and it was really fun good work
was, work, good, it, I did all the challenges and it was really fun good work
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game but you really need to use your brain or else you'll fail
is, game, favorite, nothing, LOVE IT nothing is wrong with it its my favorite game ever! Get it get it now!!!!
is, game, great, This, This is a great game! I would 100% recommend it, Lots of ways to play the Game with challenges, survival Scavenging and full on apocalypse! The Easy, normal and hard modes are also pretty balanced! Cons: Sometimes movement in the house can be glitchy makeing it slightly hard to get stuff, Costs money (but I personally think its worth it) I could go on about this game but ill leave you with this,
's, fun, good, It, It's pretty good fun
is, game, easy, it, Pretty cool game. A lot of endings. Although, it takes brain. You really must think through your choices, it's not just random. The game is unpredictable most of the time but that's what makes it fun, wondering would could happen next! You really gotta think about who you're gonna send out and think about endings! Honestly, it is not an easy game. It's actually quite hard. I think my only complaint really is the entertainment I get out of it. It does get boring , sometimes I fail after I get really far and then try again and again. After so many tries, the game can get *so* boring, a lot of reading has to be done too. I'm fully aware that this game Is *not* new, yet , I don't think it's changed much.
's, app, amazing, it, Hey it's an amazing app! But I want to refund it cus I uninstalled it but I can't refund. Its not showing the button to . So help :]
is, game, fun, It, It is a fun game to pass the time
was, way, easier, their, Its good but i wish their was an easier way to get mutant mary jane
's, game, great, It, It's a great game on PC but on mobile the beginning 60 seconds of a game needs such precise movement sometimes that it's very difficult to get a good run on mobile, wouldn't recommend on mobile but on PC 100% fine and 5 outta 5 game
's, game, funny, It, It's a funny game I just wish you had a little more time
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but just not the game for me 🙂 I still rate it 4 stars
is, rating, real, this, I really love the game but this isn't a real rating this is just a note to the developers can you please make 60 parasec to be free because I really like the game
is, game, good, It, It is a good game but here and there it will lag and the countdown with sometimes glitch. Other than that it is a awesome game!

's, thing, same, it, I love the idea of the game it's the same thing as real life
's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game
's, game, good, It, It's a good game, and that's all the good things I have to say for it. The controls are terrible and the selection process are worse than not intuitive, they hardly work at all. With time and effort it can be learned, but rather than doing that Id recommend just getting it on a different platform instead.

is, 10/10, fun, it, I saw lazarbeam play it and thought its fun I had to skip some stages but it is very fun 10/10
is, fill, good, it, I love this game so much it is a good game fill with challenges and I love it
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game!
's, game, decent, It, It's a pretty decent game. But if you can add external devices like a keyboard that would be better. Just wondering if you can add this feature
is, game, good, this, Now this game is about a situation most people don't know about by gives you a good view, and there lots of challenges and you can make up your own! And you can play it without WiFi which I have a problem finding. But anyway this is a good game and would recommend! :)
is, 😎, 👍, It, It is a good game👍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
's, game, great, It, It's a great game.
be, review, higher, it, Pretty bad but kind of good because you can barely move the screen around the walking barely works and it's not even 60 seconds it should be called 30 seconds because of how fast the timer is I wish you could have non useful items because I would just grab whatever I can grab but I would get the end because I didn't grab anything Important fix these thing and it will be a higher review
is, game, solid, it, Mobile controls makes the initial 60 seconds grabbing rush a bit rough, compared to PC version, but other than that it is a solid resource management game.
was, one, overall, it, I wanna say this is amazing but parasecs was a little less grim.. i get its supposed to be dark humor but it was a little too dark but still funny overall one of my favs
's, game, cool, It, It's a pretty cool game but it's pretty long and after a while it gets boring. Also the controls aren't very easy to use.
is, hope, fun, it, This game is hard you realy need to know how and if you don't it will be kinda hard. But this game is soooo much fun!!!!i really dont think u should have to pay to play but yea it is very fun hope that helps u...
is, game, ok, It, It is an ok game but will not let me refund it on Google play
is, thing, few, their, their is a few thing that show that they tried to make people injoy the game but the cost makes some people have to turn away from getting the game because they don't have money but the game is End of the world survival 💯 % but, the beginning they should make like a uninspired launch of a dangerous wepon and when you first play the nuclear bomb launch should be on TV 📺, he gets up and then goes in the start passion and then it goes to the start of that game. Over all it is a good game.

is, game, great, it, ill tell you the good news first it is a great game if your looking for somthing to do throught your day until when you start the match turning is like impossible and picking things up to you should really make your controlls more sensitive pls.
's, game, great, it, Awesome game despite the cost I saw one of my favorite youtubers play it and wanted to try it myself it's a great game that can keep you entertained for a while, except the controls at the beginning to gather items are hard on PC. Otherwise great game and I love it!
is, game, amazing, it, It is a 5 star game but I rated 4 stars because I can only get one game out of it before it freezes on the home screen. It might just be my phone, but it could also be a bug. Other than that it is an amazing game and it is so much fun!! 10/10 would recommend

's, game, good, It, It's a good game but the controls are weird feeling and when I unstalled the game it wouldn't give my money back
be, game, good, it, Seems like it could be a good game. Controls are clunky and you don't have enough time to prep
was, game, good, This, This was a good game! I just want a little bit better controls
's, game, good, It, It's a really good challenge game and it's also a great price instead of $20 on PC
's, price, great, it, It's a really good challenge game and it's also a great price instead of $20 on PC
's, game, poor, that, Do not like it and you only stand in that stupid little area where you do nothing waiting for somebody to die or see how much days you survive that's a poor game nobody gives about this game
be, gameplay, more, their, It gets kinda boring for a game the is 3.99 their should be a little more gameplay and it gets really glitchy not all the time butt some times. I mean I'll recomend to play it but not spend 4 dollars on it
is, reason, main, which, I saw lots of YouTubers playing it and was immediately excited when I found I could download it but it costs money which is the main reason I gave a lowered rating also the game gets boring fast
's, game, best, It, It's the best game and it was 1 of the games I wanted and I have it thanks for making the game
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game but it's too hard to get suplies when playing on a phone
's, game, good, it, I love this game to bits I've watched people like gloom play this on YouTube to I tried it but I gave that weird feeling like you look at the app and stare and stare and you play it and click off so ooooooooooooooooooooo it's a really good game
's, game, good, it, The game can use some improvements, like there should be more events ND different challenges there for everyone.Besides that it's a really good game
's, game, OK, It, It's an OK game it gets boring for me but I'm sure if you give it a try you would love it.
's, game, great, it, All I can say is it's a great game
's, part, only, that, Boring game the the Scavenging part at the beginning of the game is horribly done can't get nothing can't get out of the rooms I always get blocked by things n that's the only fun part the rest is reading maybe kuz I've played this war of mine it instantly pops up in my mind and is done better

's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game, but getting what you need fast is impossible! You can literally be right in front of the item/items you need and something a few feet away will light up green. Also if you're not in a "perfect" spot or angle it won't let you grab it. The challenges are next to impossible for that reason, over all the regular part of the game is fun, but you need to make it easier to grab items, rather than them having to be lit up as green!!
's, game, good, It, It's a good game.
's, game, awesome, It, It's a pretty awesome game, one od my favorites honestly. And I think almost anyone could enjoy this game, so I definately recommend it
be, game, good, it, I honestly hate this as an app and would like a refund for it. The controls are absolutely terrible even on easy. Besides that it would actually be a good game but considering you have to rely on the controls to gather stuff, it completely takes the fun out of it.
's, game, good, it, The controls ar AWFUL really Awful I HATE T he controls Omg- I made this in 2018 it's actually a good game I play it on laptop now!
's, game, fun, it, Its a good game but its glitchy and difficult for the frist part but it's a fun game
is, fun, much, it, 60 seconds is so much fun you can get all the supplies you need yourself or you can survive with a already packed bunker and try to survive you can send people outside to get more water food and other supplies it is so much fun I really recommend this game for anyone.
's, game, good, that, I HATE THIS APP SO MUCH, OMG! My grandson used this and threw up his orange juice all over my favorite mug. Smh wow that's truly a good game wow. It's so over rated I hate it, delete this Satan spawn of an app, Edit: Yes I know I added 5 stars, it means bad review smh.
is, game, good, It, It is a pretty good game I only got this because of Kubz Scouts if you know who that is but the touch sensitivity can be better and add more endings etc and I would give 5 stars but overall good game.
is, game, good, This, This is a good game. The controls are a bit confusing at first. But this is fun game.

is, game, great, it, I think it is a great game i love all of it
's, game, awesome, it, I've been watching Kubz Scouts play for years! Amazing game and I like that you can apply different strategies and how real life mechanics are set in place. (Water every 5 days, on the sixth you die. Food every 9 days on the tenth day you may die depending on the level) it's an awesome game and I would recommend! Samsung Galaxy J3 luna pro Edit: Ive switched phones and it works just as great on Galaxy S10+ and my boyfriend has it on his Iphone 11 pro max and it works great for him too.
's, game, great, It, It's a really great game to play when your bored! ☺
Is, game, good, This, This Is a really good game it is worth the money it really is of I were you I would down load it.
is, PC, great, It, It is a great PC to mobile port except when you go and scavenge.
's, game, bad, It, It's not a bad game.
is, game, fun, This, This is a really fun game and its addictive definitely reccomend
's, game, fun, It, Hard to play. It is very hard to scavenge around. I thought it was going to be a lot more like the PC version, but it's not. It's a fun game, but is just hard to use. I wouldn't recommend it for mobile use.
's, app, amazing, It, It's am amazing app. BUT it won't let me play online. Can you please fix it. Other than that 5 Stars so ignore initial rating please.
is, game, best, It, It is the best game I ever played I love the game I like the challenges and just how the game is
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but it's not worth $4
is, game, best, This, This is the best game ever
's, pricetag, cheap, it, Incredible title. A unique concept, cool artstyle, and fun gameplay make this a perfect buy, especially considering it's cheap pricetag. The gameplay is addicting and challenging: it offers a perfect blend between skill and RNG. Admittedly, the gameplay can become quite stale after a while, but as long as you set goals to motivate yourself, that shouldn't happen for a very long time. I Highly recommend this game!
is, addicting, vary, it, it is vary addicting!
's, untill, fun, It, It's fun untill you have to do it over and over again once you have done it all
's, funnnnnnn, fine, that, It is sooo much fun but it costs 3.69 but that's fine very very very very funnnnnnn
