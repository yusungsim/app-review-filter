was, game, good, this, Even though this was a good game to play on the pc and console, the problems with this game is you need some serious mobile hardware to play this. When i was playing this cutscenes were fine however at some points the game was crashing or other times stalling from granade explosions. The game was also crashing at random when i was just in the xcom hq managing things.
's, game, great, it, Tries to cloud save to Google+, which predictably fails, given that it hasn't existed for 2.5 years now. Misregisters the location of your touches so you have to tap sightly above buttons, and you get stuck in one demo level because you can neither shoot or cancel your action. I'm sure it's a great game but it's been abandoned for years and is approaching unsupported obsolescence.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but saving is impossible. I can't log into a Google account so my progress is never saved. Worked fine on the last phone had. It's just giving an error message. This game is unplayable without being able to save progress. Skip it until you see reviews saying its been addressed.
is, game, terrific, This, This is a terrific game, especially if you played the old XCOM games using the 3 and 1/2 inch for 5 and 1/4 inch disc. If you download this game, you're going to have a great time.
's, game, fun, It, It crashes when trying to load it resume game. It's a fun game but what's the point if you can't beat it. This problem is very common, the game isn't well optimized for mobile.
's, game, good, It, It's a pretty good game after those years of release, I just wish that multiplayer had players like before
is, way, best, this, Device: one plus 7 pro The game runs and looks great. Works perfectly with touch controls. Except for the pc this is the best way to play the game. I've had one slight issue where because of my curved screen some UI elements don't quite display right, but it doesn't impact gameplay at all so it's nothing major. I haven't tested controller support but the touch controls work so well that I wouldn't use one anyway, might be worth looking into if you have an android TV though.

's, game, best, it, Awesome port of an awesome game except they didn't do such an awesome job actually porting the game to mobile. If it would work I'd give it 5 stars and say it's the best game on mobile devices.
is, port, faithful, this, I love this game and this is a fairly faithful port of it. I wish I could give it a higher rating but the fact that I can't install it onto my SD card means I can't free up enough space to play it on my new mobile device. I'd love to be able to give it a higher rating.
be, game, great, it, Well I bought this game for 5 bucks and it seemed like it would be a great game but it would do anything it wouldnt let me attack or overwatch anything
been, port, perfect, what, This game seems phenominal. But the fact that I can't make a soldier do an elevation change with a two finger drag makes me want to do a refund. The tutorial says it should work. My experience with the game says it doesn't. I'm in the second level and I can't make the guy on the roof get to the ground. Nothing works. Seriously, how could you not employ a simple onscreen toggle that lets me change elevations? You broke what could have otherwise been a perfect android port?

is, experience, true, it, Is it perfect? No. But it is a true XCOM experience, warts and all.
's, game, favorite, it, Pretty decent game. I have problems loading sometimes using resume. Hitting single player seems to have taken care of that. I have XCOM:UFO Defence for PS1 and it's my favorite game all time. This is ok so far, could be better tho. Especially aiming percent algorithms. 80% chance to hit misses at LEAST 50% of the time which makes it very hard to survive an win even on easy mode ( and I have aiming device on them to give an extra 10% ). Your guys get killed because you miss 3 out of 4 80% shots.
's, game, good, it, Unfortunately doesn't work for new phones, got a new Galaxy S21 and I can't play anymore :( 3 stars because it's still a good game.
is, game, absolute, This, This is my absolute favorite PS3 game. I just got a Galaxy Tab A7 and was shocked to see that there is an Android version, which I decided to buy (because it's my fav). This version works better on the tablet than on the PS3! As I'm playing I keep muttering, "This is so freaking awesome!" If you like this game, don't even hesitate. I personally believe this game is one of the best games EVER made, and the Android version on my tab A7 does not disappoint!

's, experience, full, It, An incredible experience. XCOM is one of my favourite franchises of all time, and being able to play it on mobile is such an amazing thing. An incredibly faithful and functional port, too. It's truly the full experience on mobile.
is, port, exact, this, Still one of the best Xcom games out there. Other than changing the controls to touch screen controls this is an exact port of XCOM:EW the only game so good that I got 100% of the achievements on No update coming?
is, game, best, this, Yes, six years later and I'm still convinced that this is the best game on mobile.
's, game, overall, it, Fun game, sometimes a movement spot is hard to select but it's rare, overall very fun game, if you haven't played this game before, you can try the demo on steam.

's, game, favorite, It, I've been playing this game for six years. It's my favorite game. I play it on a tablet, the graphics are just amazing compared to a phone.
is, port, good, This, This is a very good port of XCOM: Enemy Within to Android. Loading times are very fast, graphics are generally clear, the sounds are very good when I listen through headphones, and the gameplay is as difficult and fun as I remember on the Steam version. My only issues have been that sometimes the touch input thinks you want to launch a grenade when you're just trying to move the landing spot a little, and there is a (edge case) AI bug that may cause an infinite loop requiring a force quit.
's, X, best, It, The BEST. It's the best X-Com and it's here on mobile.
is, games, best, This, An excellent port of the console/PC classic. The graphics take a hit but they still get the job done and the whole game including the dlc is in there. Endless hours of turn based alien fighting to be had. My only real complaint is the lack of physical controller support but the touch screen controls do the job. This is the best cell phone games I've ever played.
's, criticism, only, that, Awesome game! I loved XCOM: Enemy Unknown and i love this one too (XCOM: Enemy Within). I will say that the constant crashes is frustrating. Sometimes I'll have to open the app 7 or more time before it'll actually let me play; but that's the only real criticism i have for it.

's, title, large, it, Updated review. 5 years ago its realy impressive, even at today's rate its on the level. It's defiantly reduced compared to ps3 and no controler support. My old tablet and anther phone played multiplayer matches n touch is pretty good. it's a large 3.5 gig title and everything has failed downloading until like 4th try. So I found an old 7in sam tablet n I'm just trying to play multiplayer again with my son, can't download it GOOGLE. So I'll just keep trying "instal rulete" like I always did
's, port, complete, It, Great strategy game. It's an almost complete port of the 2013 PC game; includes all base-management and tactical-mission goodness that you could want. The three biggest issues in the game itself are: limited savegame slots (only 4? really? though not a problem if you like playing Ironman mode), semi-trivial UI issues (a few things which were easy with keyboard+mouse are not trivial with a touchscreen, like moving to a roof, and it's not hard to double-tap by mistake and cause your soldier to move) and that out of all specific missions the only one they kept was the horrible Site Recon. (Those missions are the only cut content - everything else is here, including cutscenes.) An additional problem is that the app is not updated since 2017 - either this or no-longer-present servers are probably to blame for cloud saves and multiplayer not working, and achievements/leaderboards not being viewable in the game itself (still can be viewed through Google Play Games app).
was, person, first, it, Good story n strategy game though if it was first person it had been more great but splendid game though only Little chunky is the camera though n no character customisation other than that game is great n plz add cloud save if we change device we can start from that point
been, game, splendid, it, Good story n strategy game though if it was first person it had been more great but splendid game though only Little chunky is the camera though n no character customisation other than that game is great n plz add cloud save if we change device we can start from that point
is, port, best, this, Fantastic port. Turn-based games like this is perfect for mobile. Only have minor gripes. Wish there was an option to turn off double tap to move, it was never precise enough to use reliably, especially when you start using areial units. Also, an option for scroll speed would have been amazing, rather than having to swipe a whole bunch of times to look around the larger levels. Some minor graphical glitches too. Overall, this is the best PC port I've ever played. Definite buy.
's, game, exact, it, Balls deep into the game, played it on the PS4 originally. Outstanding quality, was a little dubious about buying it. Worth every penny, it's the exact same game, a little tedious occasionally with moving the squad, nothing to take away a well deserved 5 star rating. Great job converting a great game to mobile! How about a free customised decal, armour, soldiers, ect, for an honest review ;) One happy customer! I'm using Samsung Galaxy S10.

's, price, small, that, Fabulous port from the original. Well made for mobile. Occasional glitch with saves but that's a small price to pay, and usually resolves itself with a second attempt to load. Truly, brilliant. Xcom fan forever!!
is, port, good, this, This is a classic! I love XCOM and this is fairly good port to mobile. Too bad developing ended years ago. There's little slowing down and it's easy to give wrong orders when battling. But it's still a very solid game.

's, way, good, it, This game has really been fun. I enjoyed every moment since I first bought this game it's been months now and I cant stop playing. Oh, and it's a good way of passing the time ❤❤❤
's, killer, great, it, Worth the money, they fixed most of the problems. I just wish it was a bit easier to rotate the camera. There's a bug with the carapace or skeleton armor where you select decor 2, there is an arm brace floating in the air and stretches your characters arms when moving. Other than that if you want an xcom game on the go then I recommend buying this. You can play it on the plane as an "offline" game, so it's a great time killer without a real repetativeness to it like other mobile offline games.
's, game, decent, it, Decent game. If you are looking to kill a short amount of free time, this isn't the game for you. Load up time is over a minute and even then it tends to crash and close. If you are able to get in on the second (or third) try, the missions are time consuming. Like I said, it's a decent game, but I am not looking for a game that has so much load and play time requirements.
is, game, big, it, The best value for money mobile game I have purchased- although expensive it is a big game and I have played through 3 times now, so I reckon that it works out as the cheapest per hour played. It is tough, tactical and deeply satisfying when you beat it. The AI is good and challenging on normal. The controls are excellent. This is basically the full PC game on your mobile. Shame number 2 isn't being ported.

is, microtransactions, extra, This, This is what mobile gaming should be, no extra microtransactions, no filler garbage or time limits. A solid game brought perfectly to a mobile platform 👌
is, part, key, he, I had loads of fun playing this game! Completed the game in normal difficulty. Some advice:- Develop your sniper he is a key part of completing the game successfully ;)
is, port, loaded, this, Im playing on a GS9+. Why, why, why cant more developers bring actual games to mobile platforms? Far from another idle clicking, ad infested, p2w rubbish... this is a fully loaded port of one of the all time greats. It plays well on the small screen - my only gripes are some of yhe fine detail in control. Auto zooming in on characters, and not being able to turn off double-tap to move cause some problems. Its a banger.
is, game, fantastic, it, Amazing Game, but cloud-saves and multiplayer are broken. It looks like the game's Google Play Games integration is broken due to back-end updates and 2K has no plans to restore functionality. I was really hoping to play multiplayer, but this feature is broken. Otherwise it is a fantastic game, with everything the desktop version has (except a couple of DLC that another reviewer mentioned)
is, game, hard, It, It is hard game
's, port, functional, It, What can I say? It's a fully functional port of XCOM EW.
is, time, first, this, Maybe the first truly well developed mobile game I've ever played that wasn't rife with micro transactions. I honestly think this is the first time I've encountered a game on a mobile platform that was just good old, straight up, "we developed a good game, and you can buy it and play it" No gimmicks. Made me reconsider what a mobile game can be, and made me want more XCOM in my life. A franchise I had previously ignored on other platforms.
is, crashes, sometime, it, This game is awesome. I love the added content. It is Xcom enemy unknown but with more gameplay and new soldier classes. My only issue with this game is it sometime crashes and you need to restart the game. Once game runs it runs smooth and the graphics look amazing
is, port, shoddy, this, I love xcom but this is a shoddy port. Frequent glitches halt progress and cause a lot of frustration. I strongly recommend not buying this.
is, game, amazing, this, Was working but no more, every start up the download fails and fails to find resources. Tried reinstalling and still doesn't work, its a shame because most games on android never get fixed when this issue happens. Shame because this is an amazing game when it worked.
is, game, great, It, It is a great game but when im play the game which i advance too far in mission then suddenly my character in a mission lost dia colour u know what i mean ? Like their colour became red sometime blue and static also. Sorry for my english. My phone is oppo F11 pro. Please fix the bug, i want to experience the game fully. Thank u
is, fun, much, This, Wow! Just wow! This is XCOM for PC, so so so much fun! I haven't tried the multiplayer, but the single player is just as I remembered in PC! Please oh please port XCOM 2! For those of you too young, or having never owned a gaming PC, XCOM is a game that comes from a genre that doesn't involve bombarding you with ads and P2W gameplay or unnecessary grinding and premium content! You buy the game, you get the full game!
's, port, good, It, It's a pretty damn good port. Or from the ground up, either way, it's xcom. I haven't gotten too far into it. So I can't really attest to the bugs. Though, I haven't encountered any, thus far. *after a recent system update for my galaxy a20, the game now says, after starting up, "this app was built for an older version of android and may not work properly.." we you guys be updating this game, as well? Or are we s.o.l?
is, game, great, this, Late to the party on this one, but this is still a great game for mobile. A little repetitive with the levels but challenging enough. Living up to the XCOM legacy.
's, introduction, good, it, Wish it included more content, or the option for it. Some of the crashing issues have been fixed. It definitely is much more bearable as far as controls since the original port. All in all it's a good introduction, but bare bones version for android. Still xcom, still enjoyable.if you cant get past the controls, shame on you.
is, game, decent, This, This is a decent game but kinda impossible to get anywhere as your troops keep getting killed and the missions have too many operatives to defeat. Do not bother to install.
was, time, first, It, I love the game to death and all, but Im having this one issue where EVERY time the Sectopod uses a weapon, the app totally closes out. It was my first time seeing a sectopod, so I'm just really confused as to why this is happening
was, game, free, it, So the first mission after the tutorialI'm no longer able to move one of my soldiers or attack or put him in OverWatch or do anything I literally cannot continue. If it was a free-to-play game or cheaper than it is it wouldn't be a big deal.
be, deal, big, it, So the first mission after the tutorialI'm no longer able to move one of my soldiers or attack or put him in OverWatch or do anything I literally cannot continue. If it was a free-to-play game or cheaper than it is it wouldn't be a big deal.
be, issues, reoccurring, this, I love XCOM! I've played through 1 & 2 and I'm looking forward to chimera squad. I thought I would purchase this game to occupy my time but the game was unplayed during the second mission. The function of raising the elevation of the camera or curser requires you to use two fingers to swipe up or down. After dozens and dozens of times, I was only able to accomplish this action 1 time and I know this would be a reoccurring issues I couldn't live with.
is, interpretation, good, this, Oldschool xcom fanboy. Although not as detailed as the early precursors, this is a good modern interpretation.

's, game, ported, It, Love it! To Fix the - - Crash on game load: Wait for you Google profile to load before trying to resume a game. To Coping with - - Buggy controls: It's a ported game never meant for a tiny phone screen. Deal with it or go back to the "Pay to Win" games.
was, alil, easier, it, Wish it was alil easier to complete missions to get further in the game
was, game, based, it, Payed only 5.49$ for this magnificent game — on Xbox Live it was 19.99$. Best turn based strategy game @ Google Play. Played through the game multiple times and never needed to make in game purchases. And I'm very happy to see no graphical difference between my Xbox 360 and my Smartphone (Umidigi A5 Pro Phone). Only disadvantage is that it has less maps than the Xbox version. Big thanks to the developers
is, game, great, This, This is a great game but over writes the original which I would also like to play again.
was, map, different, it, XCOM is awesome. Sadly this port has not been updated in a long time so the app crashes randomly. This is usually a few missions in so it gives you a false hope that you will be fine. For me it crashes at the beginning of a mission on the second month. Really got my hopes up, I started two games to make sure it can be reproduced. Both times it was a different map so that's not even a specific one. I will update my review if this is fixed.

is, port, good, this, Played the very first PC game way back when, have to say this is a very good port. Only gripe is I am having trouble moving my characters up and down levels. Other than that it's very enjoyable.
's, game, real, it, EDIT: Year later, new tablet with 4Gb RAM running smooth. Uses between 500Mb-1Gb memory, so 1Gb of FREE RAM is a hard minimum requirement. Doesn't have Slingshot or Progeny questlines, which I really liked on PC. Misses the option to turn off the Enemy Within expansion content like you can on PC. My problem with the DLC is mostly because how rubbish and easy the whole EXALT "questline" is after aliens. Still, a great game, and a very good port, considering it's a real PC game originally.
's, screen, black, It, It worked great at first. About my third time getting on the game it wont even work. It's a black screen. Nothing loads. I want a refund.
'm, money, wasted, I, my phone is warming up. the tutorial doesn’t work, I’m stuck on some kind of stupidity and can’t move on. I'm disappointed, wasted money.
is, game, best, This, This is the best tactical game, i have to play
is, game, tactical, This, This is the best tactical game, i have to play
was, game, perfect, It, It was a perfect game on console, and it's perfect here, even includes the Enemy Within DLC, absolutely Worth every cent, however it requires a pretty good device, my tablet lags every time an object moves
's, port, great, It, It's a great port. But I can't play it. Whenever I play a mission and kill every alien the mission doesn't end. And I can't climb on roof
's, game, real, it, Works with android 10. Watch out with the resume button (autosave) as it often doesn't work and you lose your game if you don't have a manual save. Even though you can save manually at any time this is ridiculous for a paid product. When I didn't play for a year my game wouldn't run but after reinstalling it the game and saves were fine. Too bad there are some bugs like this but the game is still great and it's actually a real game unlike most shallow stuff that is on phones and tablets.
's, Port, old, It, THAT'S XCOM BABY! I can't complain. It's an old Port that doesn't seem to be supported anymore, but it still works on my Pixel 3xl with Android 10. It crashes when I try to save to cloud, but local saves still work. It's a legit, full Port, not a dumbed down version. It lends itself well to touch screens. I just wish there were more turn based tactics games of this quality on mobile. Maybe Port XCOM 2? Something!

is, version, best, this, This is it. Look no further. X-COM is probably the best turn based action game out there and this is the best version. Don't hesitate, don't miss this game, it is truly unmissable.
's, port, great, it, Probably my favorite game of all time it's a great port to mobile, would recommend a tablet though.
is, game, epic, This, This is an epic game!
's, mechanic, hood, it, So realistic best tactical game ever,everything in the game takes time and when a soldier die it's dead forever it's a hood mechanic and stressful and very hard to play it's amazing how much work and thinking was put this game
is, mods, new, this, Best game i' ve played on mobile. Fun and difficult. I played X-com: Enemy Unknown, and this is almost just like that, other than, the new mods with troops, and the EXALT forces.
's, port, full, It, XCOM: Enemy Within for mobile is a diamond in the rough. It's a full port of XCOM Enemy Unknown with the Enemy Within DLC and translates well to mobile devices. The camera controls are a bit wonky at times, but it's easier to figure out over time. This game works flawlessly on my Motorola Z3 and it's a great game to pass the time.

is, example, prime, This, This is a prime example of how to port a game correctly. All the elements of the original are there. The UI is functional. Yes, you need suitable hardware to run it, and a dev can't account for every iteration of Android. But if it really isn't working on your device, that's why the refund button is there. Pick it up for cheap on PC or Console.

'm, fan, com, I, Great game, I'm a big X-com game fan is X-com 2 coming to mobile app as well. If so will it be for Moto Z4
being, game, tactical, this, Unplayable, the elevation controls are broken, this being a tactical game renders it useless. How do I get a refund?
was, game, first, This, This was the first game I was giving 5 stars. I never played xcom before and it keep me hooked for several days still I was playing and it's same as pc nothing changed and it's awesome. The only thing I feel bad on this game is when any of my solider dies...
