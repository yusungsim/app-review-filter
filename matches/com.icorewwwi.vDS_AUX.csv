is, emulator, best, it, While is it unfortunate that you have to pay for it, it is the best DS emulator for android money can buy. Heavily customizable in every setting possible and runs at a very consistent framerate. If I could rate 4.9 stars I would because me likey dark mode and there's no dark mode feature.
is, emulator, only, this, I don't usually rate apps anymore but this is legitimately the only good DS emulator on the app store. If you want something that runs good to fill you with Nostalgia this is the emulator you want. Might seem glitchy at times but you just have to go to the settings to fix it and if you're confused they have a help button! (:

's, emulator, great, It, It's a great emulator I love it. Though speeding up makes it a little weird and sometimes there are glitches.
's, emulator, exact, It, It's the exact same emulator as Drastic DS, but without the touch screen calibration issues. Thanks!

is, emulator, Drastic, This, This is just the Drastic emulator I can't refund this now but I will support the original creator.
is, emulator, good, this, There's No multiplayer, and I was HOPING for multiplayer so i could play with my phone and my DSi on Kirby Super Star Ultra. I REALLY dislike that that the developers haven't added multiplayer (and they probably won't, either based on how they said it.) if you like playing DS games without friends or multiplayer this is a good emulator. It doesn't lag much or crash much on newer Android devices. Thank you for reading! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
is, emulator, best, This, This is the best NDS emulator.. it's cheaper than Drastic.
is, remake, drastic, it, Screw these other people when they say it is a drastic remake. Desume the makers of the Ds pc emulator were absolutely ripped off by the maker of drastic. They were going to seek legal action against this dude since they said no making money off of it. I would think because it is a nintendo creation They couldn't. I would say it's fair game. Who ever made this did a good job. Feels good.

is, emulator, excellent, this, Money well spent! I can enjoy all my favorite games and classics and not have to worry about lag or crash issues. For being only $1, this is an excellent nds emulator.
's, problem, major, it, I was relatively happy with the app, and it has a lot of cool features. Unfortunately it's had reoccurring issues with save states. Recently, all the save states managed to get deleted - even the Google drive ones. Only savestates were affected, not layout options or settings, but it's a pretty major problem.
is, emulator, Drastic, This, This is Drastic Ds emulator, how is this even legal? It even has the same bugs

was, underneath, Drastic, This, This was literally Drastic DS emulator underneath. I have drastic installed in my phone and when I opened this, the saves actually loaded from the same folder. Refunded immediately after purchase.
is, emulator, good, This, This is a good emulator, but only one problem i got when i play every ds game... The L button automatically touched everytime i press the other buttons... And that was annoying, interupting the gameplay..so, within a few minutes i decided ti refunding it.
was, reskin, shameless, it, An update d reskin of the DraStic ds emulator. It's cheaper but supports more updates and has more compatibility and crashes less often. xbox controller support is iffy on more intense games like super Mario 64. Would be 5 stars if it wasnt a shameless reskin, but it provides updates that drastic doesnt have
is, copy, shameless, it, I'm going to be honest, the app runs flawlessly. Haven't had a crash whatsoever from when I first bought it. Why am I rating 1 star even though it works flawlessly? This is thanks to the fact that it is a shameless copy of DraStic, plagiarised through and through. Even the directory says DraStic. If you care about DS Emulation, you'll support the original developers instead. I had only come to the realisation that it was a shameless copy after buying it.

be, deal, good, this, So, the app does stay true to it's words though, this is a reskin of the more well known, DraStic - DS Emulator. Even the file directory tells you so. Now, I would say this could be a good deal if you wanted the plagarized, cheaper version of an outdated DraStic, you are more than welcome to do so. You may get the same experience as you do for DraStic depending on your hardware. But, if you want software updates and less likely to experience crashes. I would highly recommend DraStic.
is, app, best, This, This is the best app for ds emulator. I RECOMMEND YOU GET THIS APP
is, emulator, drastic, this, Dude, look at your internal storage and you could find a drastic folder on it. Why? Because this is a drastic emulator, skinned version perhaps. Anyways... Thank yoyu.
is, emulator, Drastic, This, This is literally Drastic emulator with a different name. Legitimately exact same set up, same load up, same play out for the cheat database. Even worse, it has the same limitations on games it can run, just like Drastic does.
is, emulator, best, this, I don't think it's an understatement to say this is the best ds emulator on the play store. All the others are either loaded with ads, laggy, or more commonly, both. This emulator runs games perfectly for just a dollar, with no ads whatsoever. Definitely worth it.
's, emulator, good, it, Congratulations, you made a emulator that crashes every time you start a game, honestly it's a good emulator, but it definitely crashes a lot for me, not sure why, I have no cheats or anything on, just plain old vDS Emulator, so, not too happy
's, lag, Cheap, it, The best emulator I got Why? 1.Because it's Cheap 2.No lag 3.You can make shortcuts for the games 4.The cheat is available (you can add your own cheat code too) Reccomended for people who doesn't have a ds
is, copy, drastic, this, First of all this application is stolen because this is a drastic emulator copy and paste, the ui is the same, controls and settings, practically everything is different except the startup menu is changed just to cover-up that they don't own this code that they "made". But the fortunate thing about this emulator that it partially works and is much more cheaper then the drastic emulator itself, so it depends for the consumer to decide, to pay for a cheaper app or a more expensive app.
's, app, great, it, It can be kinda laggy sometimes. Also, if it had a game speed multiplayer would be an awesome addition. Otherwise it's a really great app to use
is, emulator, best, This, This is by far the best emulator to this day, well worth the 1‚Ç¨ price. It's super well optimized, uses no more power than a regular lightweight game. Super customizable, no crashes, definitely recommend!
