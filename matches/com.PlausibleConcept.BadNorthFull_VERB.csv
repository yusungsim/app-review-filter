reminds, of, days, Excellent game, reminds me of the good old days of mobile gaming. No ads, no microtransactions, no pay to win. It's simple, yet challenging and well balanced. Bugs are few and far between. I'd love to see more content for it, especially a gamemode that involves attacking an island instead of defending it.
started, in, spot, Fun game definitely but I'm a little annoyed by it right now. I had a campaign that was all the way to the last island but I didn't have the right set of troops. So, I decided to start a new game but save the first campaign so I could go back to it. I started a new game, in a new save spot and thought all was good. Going back into the game however, it seems my first campaign was overwritten by my new one. Very frustrating when I wanted to keep that first one. Other that that, good game.
work, with, game, Very cool game. But my Gamesir Type-C controller doesn't work with this game. I don't know if it's supposed to be supported or not, but it's frustrating nonetheless. Thank you!
going, for, it, looked cools, pretty boring only thing it has going for it is decent graphics
enjoying, for, days, Edit: I now have my saves back. 5/5. This game is great if not for the fact that it now appears to regularly delete my save files. I was quite enjoying it for the first two days of playing, but then it decided not to ever save when I leave the app. As it stands I am not going to put more effort in, but if it is fixed I will happily rate 5/5.
paid, for, that, I must be missing something really spectacular. Either that or these are 12 year old boys leaving the lunatic-esque 5 star reviews of an otherwise plain game that their parents unknowingly paid for.
pay, for, game, Why does this game erase my progress and all my saves, its the 2nd time already, I didnt pay for this game to erase all my hard and very hard progress +my very hard hard save, please fix this nonsense I really like this game

Works, with, Mouse, Lovely Strategy Stage Clearing Game. I own the Steam Version. Works best with a Mouse, but also works with touch screen. *Update: kept Crashing - Chrome OS - Refunded. 5 -> 3.

used, with, other, MOOOOOOOOORE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE MORE. AHHHHHH IT WAS SO GOOD. Okay but actually, this game is simple at face value, but you start to understand how the three classes of units interact, and how they can be used with each other to boost both of their capabilities. I want more. This game was insanely good.
defend, against, Vikings, Super polished game where you micromanage up to 4 units to defend your island against Vikings. Your units and vikings units have a class, which defines their strength and weakness (pikes, shields, bows). It is real time but with slow motion and tiles when you select a unit. It is very tactical. You jump from island to island, purchased by the Vikings (think FTL), so you need to choose and optimize your battles to gain time. And the game is beautiful ♡ 5 stars easy.

going, into, it, Great game, not sure how I felt going into it, but glad I got it. Awesome graphics and gameplay, dev's outdid themselves.
allow, for, gamepad, Please allow for manual gamepad key configuration. Currently it does not respond to my Glap Play P1. If this is done ANY controller will work. Then you don't need to support all those controllers. Please do the same to Kingdom Two Crowns. UPDATE: Controller support still broken, DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT TO USE A GAMEPAD. Customer support doesn't fix or answer!

find, As, someone, Such an amazing game I couldn't believe it. As someone who loves strategy I could never find a mobile game that satisfied that until I came across Bad North. It's simple but challenging when faced with the invaders from different directions with different attack styles. The game won't tell you everything and will only show you the basics which might be a turn off for most but for me I loved picking up on the important things. Would recommend to any strategy lover out there.

lose, after, bit, I don't think I would like that this game a lot because it is very bad and you would always lose after a little bit you will die instantly after one army and you would get very frustrated and mad so with the star free star because it is very madness and and very bad

experiencing, with, campaign, I'm experiencing the same problem as some others, with my campaign after a while not ever getting past the "generating islands" part of the loading screen Great game But this needs fixed xcc :edit: so, that problem was fixed, but, after i progressed to around 70 something % in my first campaign, it seemed to stop revealing the next 2 connected islands in the chain? And now i cant do _anything_ in that campaign and had to start a new one unu

takes, with, Islands, Very fun. You'll want more than one playthrough for sure, as there are unlockables, new things to learn each time, and multiple difficulties. Each playthrough takes between 1.5 and 3 hours with 60 + Islands and up to 40 turns. Command your squads to hold a series of islands using the topography of the islands and different weapon types. Some can be defended with 1 squad, while some need 4. Squadron commanders can be upgraded: weapon skills, special abilities and unique item upgrades.

finished, in, bro, 1 finished your game only in 2 hr bro now 1 bored again
hooked, on, It, This game is simple beautiful challenging at times and incredibly fun i always enjoyed playing and i even got a few friends hooked on It worth every penny
incorporate, in, story, Alright a few suggestions and things about it, one it is kinda slow (granted I have a kinda sucky phone) and does take 10 seconds to load water but it's fine and perfectly playable. My suggestion to the devs is that they make a different mobile edition where you're given a random island each time rather than a full play through and you could incorporate black water in the story some how since it takes time to load in the blue. Tl;dr, suggestion for devs, andif you have the money go for it!!

played, for, hour, Obviously my opinion, but this game does a horrible job of teaching you how to play and what is important to prioritize. I played for an hour and then faced the berserkers. Of course I lost all my commanders, not such a big deal I thought, will replay the level. But no, it's game over. Have to start a new save and play the exact same levels for another hour. Some people are obviously into this (a la Dark Souls) but for me it's not worth it. Otherwise great game except for the perma-death.

played, through, game, Fun app. Lots of smart enemies, the difficulties scale well, and has lots of variability. However, you can't delete save files so once you've played through the game 6 times you are limited to just the save files you have

start, at, beginning, I love the game and everything about it but my game keeps losing its files or the file is unacceptable. I would give it 5 stars but because I have to start at the beginning every time I want to play this gets 3 stars.
starting, in, mode, Really enjoying so far. Seems I have a bug. After leaving the game it goes back to the title screen and I'm unable to press start. The quit button works fine but start does not. Tried killing all apps, and starting in airplane mode but no change. Restarting my device seems to be the only fix
spend, on, game, I loved this game. It's so basic and beautiful. The music, the visuals, sound fx. It's so rare that I spend money on an mobile game and don't at some point feeling buyers remorse. Buy this game, it's great

play, in, one, Good game but doesn't save so... can't play every level in one sitting lol
playing, after, year, Unbelievably addictive, I thought I was going to waste my money, but here I am now, still playing it after a year. Heck, I played it today!
run, at, FPS, Just wish it could zoom in more and run at higher FPS
looks, like, version, Was a great game but I'm having an issue with it. All my save game data is unaccessible. It gives me an error whenever I try to load a game. So it's unplayable for now. My app icon looks like an older version of the game. Not sure if that has something to do with it.

facing, on, ships, They we're coming facing backwards on the ships. They are a lot like my old friends. Best game my favourite
manage, to, extent, The game has great potential, sadly the units' AI is so lame, they can watch an enemy a block away destroying a house without doing anything, which is super annoying since it's not reasonable to micro manage units to that extent. Other than that. Could have been a five.
reset, to, zero, My progress was reset to zero out of the blue. This is pure grabage.
continue, with, campaign, I love the game except I can't continue with the previous campaign which I last played. When I open the game the next day all my progress is gone or deleted without me knowing. I test it multiple time and the game progress is lost no matter what. I think the game got problem with auto-save.
throws, at, you, A game where micromanagement of even the smallest timings make the difference between losing or winning a fight. The game throws new challenges at you progressively, but does tend to get a bit tedious and grindy around the higher turns. Every map is something new, every island has it's own strategies. 10/10 would buy again
allows, for, styles, Thought the game was going to be simplistic and one dimensional, but it seems to have much more depth than meets the eye. Only gets better as you progress and allows for diverse play-styles and tactics to be utilitzed. Been having a great time with this one! Easily recommended, it's just perfect for a mobile game. The fact that it's a premium game (pay once for full access) without having a single microtransaction within it, makes me love it even more. Kudos to the devs, much appreciated.

played, through, times, Awesome game play and fun strategy, played through multiple times already!
wiped, like, others, Great game but like most others my saves get wiped back to the start of a campaign so there's no point in even playing and the developers don't seem to be addressing this issue
signed, into, Play, Great game just make sure you're not signed into Google Play because if you do it glitches out and will allow you to save your progress
says, on, label, Fantastic little game. Does what it says on the label. No in-app purchases. Incredibly fun.
learn, by, trial, Game is really fun but I keep losing my files so I don't think I'll be playing again. Enemies keep getting stronger but your units are a little limited. This forces you to make two strong squads instead of one super squad with good substitutes. This game also doesn't explain enemy weaknesses. This makes your first run-through extremely difficult as you learn by trial and error. So enable level restart if you are starting. Some enemies also look similar but play differently. Game lacks story.
lost, after, session, Defective Game. 😿 No game data is saved, and all game progress is lost after each session, despite valid connection to Google Play Games. Perhaps the game doesn't check if it has read and write permission to the device's filespace. This problem occurs on phones and tablets.

like, about, game, It kept me engaged with how difficulty increased as you kept progressing. Although the game comes short. There could be more enemies and more abilities in my opinion reason being because I've completed this game more than once.The appearance option in the beginning of the game is one of the little things I like about this game. Theres moments where you're stuck with a weak squad barely surviving against a horde of Giants. All in all great strategy game. Nice graphics and easy controls. KeepItUp

had, for, years, Favorite phone game so far. I've had it for 2 years at least and it still has replay value that outstacks the first run value of the hundreds of other phone games I've downloaded and pitched since I got it. Phenomenal game.
had, to, point, I do think the game had a lot of potential and user it to its highest point it is a really good strategy game and quite interesting however I do believe it needs more spice like more upgrades for the units a backstory and even a multi-player mode but until then I don't think I'll be playing
played, through, game, The game is really fun. Fantastic artwork. The only problem I keep having is that the game keeps deleting my progress. I have not actually played through the entire game because if i close the game for an extended amount of time it will delete my progress. This has happened to me every time without fail. This bug causes an extreme lack of desire to play because I know my progress will be deleted if I can't finish the game in one go. It's not a phone problem, I just got a new one. Please fix.

put, into, restarting, Overall a fantastic game. Im not usually a fan of the rouge light formula because you put so much time into restarting but this fealt different. It was enjoyable all the way thorugh and you can finish it in 1 or 2 attempts on easy or moderate difficulty.

given, to, units, Awesome strategy game with very soothing visuals. The gameplay is smooth and challenging. I only wish skills given to units were interchangeable.
lost, after, hours, This game is amazing. But I just lost my progress after 25 hours of amazing fun.
select, by, mistake, The game play I quite like. But I hate the selection of things. its too easy to select a skill for a group by mistake, (which you can't unselect). I keep skipping turns when you don't want to. Every game I played I had chosen something I didn't want.
played, in, while, this is one of the funnest games I have played in a while.
wiped, at, %, Got my save wiped randomly at 70% of the first campaign. Design and gameplay is perfect, graphics simply beautiful, sounds are atmospheric and cute, but having all the progress and upgraded units lost is really disheartening.
resulting, in, most, I've had the same issue reported by other players with the save system not working, resulting in most of my progress being wiped. Makes the game unplayable, which is a shame.
opening, on, phone, This game was great until it stopped opening on my phone. I can get to the main menu but the "start game" button is not pressable.

playing, for, hours, Been playing this game for a few hours now on the beginner / easy mode. What I like about this game is that it is easy to learn. It's very easy to pick up and start playing and overall, is an enjoyable game. However, as others have experienced, it has wiped my saved games on more than one occasion and that is very frustrating. Also, it doesn't feel so much like a strategy game as it does a reaction game, where you just move your units towards the threats as they approach.

signing, on, cloud, Works really well on PC, but I am having minor problem with this version. I cannot save my progress even after signing in on cloud.
play, on, side, My favorite game of all time, I find myself coming back all the time to play again. Such a great game to play on the side or to play seriously. An amazing roguelike.
indie, of, days.cheer, i loved it!! why play free when you can buy fun?😅..it worth every dollar.i support indie anytime of days.cheer!!!

play, on, console, Used to play on console but it seems to have a bug where it wont load your saves so it becomes impossible to actually play this game
add, for, guys, Awesome game nice graphics I love the islands shapes and sizes. but they need to add more variety of units for the good guys.I have three suggestions. Like mace men they're skill would be spinning attack which they spin in a circle across a straight line. Then spearman they're skill would be destruction which they throw they're spears and last but not least javalin men they have shields they're skill would be barrage when they throw their spears each kills three men in the boat . That is all !!

spin, across, line, Awesome game nice graphics I love the islands shapes and sizes. but they need to add more variety of units for the good guys.I have three suggestions. Like mace men they're skill would be spinning attack which they spin in a circle across a straight line. Then spearman they're skill would be destruction which they throw they're spears and last but not least javalin men they have shields they're skill would be barrage when they throw their spears each kills three men in the boat . That is all !!

spent, on, thing, Pls fix the game saving problem, i spent hours on this thing and when i come back i have to start over???
put, in, progress, This is one of my favorite games of all time. But the saving bug dampens my love for the game. Everytime you put in progress and then leave all of it is erased. If this is fixed I will update this post to five stars

restart, from, scratch, It is an awesome game, my only problem with it is that everytime I open the app I have to restart the game from scratch, so I can't pick up my progress from the last game I was playing and even when I have completed campaigns in the past it hasn't saved that I have.

gone, thru, campaign, ...wonderful game....but....my save was gone 2/3rds thru the campaign. Now it won't save at all...uninstall..reinstall...install to main drive and also my SD card... still not saving. An awesome 5* game when the save function is fixed...??

keep, on, Android, I love the game on PC but on Android my savings just keep on getting lost. SAD.
recommend, to, fans, It is a very good game that I highly recommend to rts fans.
opened, after, closing, Great game but unplayable in its current state. Game won't save. Starts for first time everytime program is opened after closing. If fixed, 5 stars for sure
EDITED, in, July, [EDITED by me in July 2021] They have fixed the save issue. My game saves regularly and automatically now and I can come back to it without having to start over. I am giving this game a well deserved five stars. I love everything about it, from the gameplay and concept to the graphics and sounds.

looks, like, lot, Game breaking bug prevents saving progress. It's a real shame. This looks like a lot of fun and the first couple levels were great. Unfortunately it's not playable at all in its current state as you have to start over every time you close the app.
lays, to, battery, Great game. Absolutely lays waste to your phone battery. Horrible on mobile, if you want to play this game do so on PC.

start, over, time, Not saving anymore so I have to start over each time.
looking, in, settings, For those of you who say you have a save bug that is not the case, looking in my settings I found that the game does not automatically have storage as a permission which then causes it to get wiped, go to the game in your settings and allow storage as permissions , when I did this I got my old save which was 48% complete from awhile back, but I can't guarantee that you will get yours back, just that it will start saving and you can start progressing through the game

takes, to, screen, Great game, but cant play it I most certainly enjoyed the game, but suddenly one time when i try to launch it, after it finishes loading and takes me to the menu screen with the "start" button, it simply wont let me press it and play the game, however i can press the x on top right to exit, plz fix and ill change review

leading, for, screen, Good ut it just stays leading for the starting screen
play, at, risk, The gameplay was fun and the grapics are more detailed than i expected, but then i realize, the save file dosn't work,and I dont reccomend buying it. if you want it play it at your own risk.
doss, from, time, Great game, good controls, awesome graphics. I do think there should be more content, like an event or a bigger skill tree. But overall, I loved this game, very enjoyable. There is one thing though, there's a bug where pressing start doesn't work, nothing happens. It doss this from time to time, don't know if it's just my device... Anyway, I'll edit this review when those things happen. Worth the price.
own, on, PS4, Wonderful game, own it on PS4 and Xbox one. And now I have it on the go! Such a fun real time strategy game that keeps you on your toes. Great way to pass the time.

progress, without, games, Fun but the save games don't persist after quiting the game. You can't really progress without the save games. Reddit users have reported this issue since 2018. Signing out of the play store does allow you to save a game. Just be sure to do it before you start a game. Clicking achievements will let you sign out.

played, on, mobile, Great game, can be as challenging as you want to make it and has a lot of replay value. One of the best games I've played on mobile since the hexage games.

do, with, sync, Save game bug note: looks like it has to do with play games account sync. If you log out of your play games account the saves work!!! Love the pc game and saw this as a no-brainer buy..... Please devs get the save bug wrapped up!! Love the game!

playing, on, phone, Great fun. I'm playing it on android phone and two things would be useful. My eyes are not as good as they were so pinch zoom on the island map and if the incoming viking boats could better indicate type of unit. I'm sure this is less of an issue on larger screens.
play, as, invader, Sandbox wood be cool but It wood be cool if they added another mode where you play as the invader to attack the island dev pls see this
finish, in, day, Pretty fun game, the control are nice and responsive and the combat are pretty fun, the replay value of this game is also good. However I've encounter bug where the game didnt save your progress or straight out deleted your save file. This game also lack content,you can finish this game in a day, I dont know if the developer planning on implementing new update or not but theres not many diffrent skill/perk to keep playing this game in a long time

heard, about, it, I have always wanted to play this game ever since I heard about it 2 years ago and man it is a blast, 10000000/5 stars 🤩🤩🤩
loses, like, review, A great game for sure, but just like everyone's review, the game loses progress everytime I exit the app. I can't recommend this to anyone unless this bug gets fixed.
recommend, despite, fact, Very good game actually. Looks beautiful, great sound, simple gameplay yet challenging. Highly recommend despite the fact I tried 5 times to beat the game 😅
expand, on, some, My favorite mobile game. Simple yet strategic. Would be really interesting to see the developers expand on some of the creativity they expressed in this game.

ask, for, refund, This game is so poorly adhered to. I'd ask for a refund if it was even plausible. This game does, however, do one thing consistently- crash. Shame...looks like it would be fun to play. Two thumbs down.
felt, At, point, Beautiful game. Incredible amounts of fun. Held about 40 hours of playtime for me. At that point I felt I had figured out the strategy and the game has nothing more to offer
found, from, Games, First found this from Epic Games, as part of their "free games" program. Found it fun there, but the simplicity really lends itself best to mobile gaming. One problem I had with it: the map has a fog system that gradually unveils the islands as you progress. Now, I happen to have gotten to a sort of chokepoint in islands, and it just so happens that my path is blocked by a single unit of fog. As annoying as it is, I find it kind of hilarious. Anyhow, it's a quality timewaster.

happening, to, me, I love this game, the controls translate to touchscreen very well, the gameplay is simple and fun, and it's pretty good quality. This would be a 5-star review, HOWEVER, this game has a crippling save bug. It's only just started happening to me. 3 times in a row my save just gets deleted as soon as I quit the game. It doesnt matter if you leave during a battle, exit to main menu, or close the game. You lose your save file and all your time you spent on it.

play, for, hour, So I play for an hour last night, and check the game progress. Seems as if there is a saved profile. Return this evening. No saved profile and I have to start over. Something I'm missing? Or blatant disregard from devs?
gain, during, game, This is an exceptional defense game with sweet graphics and cool sound effects. I she enjoyed playing the game. Pros, graphics, sound effects, scrolling in and out, challenging, easy to play. Cons, it's hard to remember all of the saved attributes that you can gain during the game including the bonuses to your commanders. It takes a while to play and get good at it but it is enjoyable. I don't think it's nearly as good as polytopia, but still replayable.

become, after, days, The game is nice. The graphics are nice. The map is limited. And there is not much variation. Sure, the maps are auto generated, but after a few days it will become obvious this is more of the same.
looking, for, game, The exact game I've been looking for!!
play, through, time, Love this game. Very beautiful and simple. Well worth it. Only suggestion, can there be a quick play feature, so just a random map generator with a choice of different levels. So we dont have to always play the carrer through each time, But a choice for quick random map games. Thanks.
Downloaded, after, months, Edit review. Previously gave 1 star just due the game crashing and not loading. Was literally unplayable. Downloaded again after few months and works fine now. Game is a delight with fun mechanics, graphics and music. Great game to play when I'm meant to be working. Back to 5 stars.
do, in, whil, I really love this game and its challenges you to do things outside of the box and all around a great game except for the lag every once in a whil
lost, on, files, You SERIOUSLY need to fix the save issues. I have lost 50% on 2 different files. Might have something to do with starting offline, but that needs fixed. I am 57% in and clouds block my way. I can't get through.
played, for, hours, Doesn't save progress, played for around 3 hours, got various achievements on Google play, returned a couple days later to find all on game progress was gone, nothing in codex, no save slots, happens every single time. Waste of time until that's fixed.

breaking, on, easy, Solid game design. Simplistic controls but surprisingly high amount of strategy. Would have given 5 stars if end game hadn't become near impossible. Final arrow enemies are game breaking OP, even on easy
restarted, from, it, My save game appears to have been deleted? I had reached a checkpoint and restarted from it and now my game is gone? Otherwise the game is pretty good. Could use more units for the player to strategically use.
turned, into, game, 😀amazing that the devs turned this amazing steam creation into a mobile game
watching, on, YouTube, Tad bit pricy for the repetitive gameplay but it's good and brings back memories of watching it on YouTube.
mentioned, in, review, Great game! Would definitely recommend. Genuinely surprised there are still cell phone games worth playing! Best cell game I've played in quite some time.Thanks! As mentioned in another player's review, the only addition I can think of is after game completion having the option to replay from the beginning using your endgame upgraded troops.

works, on, Note, I absolutely loved this game. It's an adorable and fairly challenging micro-RTS game that's well worth your money. Tons of customization and nuances. It works so well on my Galaxy Note 10 with the stylus. My only issue is that my 8bitdo n30 pro 2 controller does not work for this game at all even if controller support is available. I won't knock points off it just because it's a very fun game. Please fix the controller issue 😁

leave, with, game, Can't play the app keeps kicking me too slow and won't load islads will have to leave my phone with the game on please update really cool game 🎮
get, pike, units, Very simple game took awhile to finish but it's to easy. If you need a tip then get 2 pike units and 1 shield one archers are totally useless.
took, to, finish, The game took me about 5 hours to finish, which felt about right for this game. The game makes you think and be tactical to make your troops effective and keep them safe. There are multiple difficulty options so it should be too easy/hard for most people. My only suggestion to the devs would be to perhaps have the availability to play through the game again with your upgraded troops at a harder difficulty. Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was the best mobile game I've played in about a year.

get, with, units, Worth every penny, I do wish there were more character upgrades as it does get repetitive rather quickly with only 3 units. The pikeman doesn't even seem worth using to me at all as the swordsman just has better damage and defense, and although archers are good enough i end up just using swordsman constantly. Not sure what all the technical issues people are complaining about are, as I haven't personally had any problems besides a lack of variety to keep things from getting old. Overall great.

livr, with, a, I love the game i lobe the grafics style i love the fighting i love the upgrades but thr should make it to where you can change some ones role but its ok if you dont cuz i can livr with out its a you can press start its just that you have to wait a little bit the screen will get a little brighter when you can press start but only problem is it takr long to load.
froze, on, screen, Watched a video review. Gameplay seemed seamless and straight forward. Pay and play to find out tap accuracy registry is about 70%. Had a bug that just froze the game on the gold win screen. Lost progress. Refund.
made, to, checkpoint, Fun game. Decent upgrades, but not very diverse. Not overly difficult for the sake of balance. Several times I switched apps and when I came back to the game it didn't resume from where I left off. Then when I finally made it to a checkpoint and later returned to the game, it keeps failing to load the game.

go, past, start, Fun game but as others have said it has a frustrating bug that freezes and won't let you go past start. Even a phone restart won't fix it. Hopefully the developer does something.
played, on, mobile, The absolute BEST strategy game I've played on mobile
expecting, for, price, I was expecting more for that price. Gameplay is boring after a while.

depend, on, houses, I LOVE games like this just the rush of having to defend the houses because you have to depend on the houses
Works, on, 8pro, Works great on OnePlus 8pro. One complain is that game needs to connect online, not sure why its needed in this game, unnecessary.
needed, in, game, Works great on OnePlus 8pro. One complain is that game needs to connect online, not sure why its needed in this game, unnecessary.
work, After, that, Great game...when it works. I can usually play once every time I restart my phone. After that, the start button won't work but the exit button will. Fix that and this will be a 5 star.
lose, on, day, Pretty cool game actually. Finished it multiple time, though you can lose the whole thing on a bad day.
made, with, way, This game is incredibly well made with a very specific way of play. Not something for everyone but it's without a doubt quality.
challenging, at, times, Awesome game! The simplicity and strategy of playing this game is lots of fun and challenging at times!
love, to, game, So much fun. I love the strategic depth to such a simple game.
play, as, invaders, The most aesthetically pleasing strategy game I have ever played. I hope they release a companion game we you can play as the invaders!
doing, with, idea, Potentially a 5 star but the constant save errors are too much to deal with. Sick of re-doing the same levels with no idea when it's going to just crash for no reason. 1 star.

bump, to, stars, Love the game. My one complaint is that while the horde defending is fun there aren't any actual bosses. Not even a viking chieftan. Add bosses for the checkpoint islands and a big final boss for the last stand island and I'll bump my review to 5 stars.
Going, through, levels, Saving progress never worked. Have to restart each time. Going through the beginning levels growing armies becomes tedious. After a few levels, the only challenge is the clunky controls.
hit, on, phone, It's alot of fun, pretty much a tower defense but with more strategy. I see people are having save issues where their save files aren't there or the game isn't saving. I'd recommend not hitting the return to menu button, instead, when you're done playing just hit the home button on your phone and close it that way. When you come back to the game your save should be there. If you die or lose you have to start over. My saves are always there and I can always pick up where i left off.
start, from, beginning, NOT WORTH SPENDING MONEY UNTIL BUG IS FIXED. It's a really nice game and addictive but have to start from the beginning every time which makes it very frustrating. Need to fix asap and will happily edit my review at that point

Gets, over, time, Pretty fun. Gets a little samey over time. Decent for a bathroom break, though.
challenging, at, end, Fun start, challenging at the end. Big screen is a must.
sums, for, me, Boring play loop. Not enough variety of units, small islands, and something else I can't out my finger on. Refunded the game. Boring sums this one up for me
play, from, start, Can you please fix the saving thing? Do i have to play from the start every time I come back? I didn't fail or die .. and I exited using the in-game button .. but why do I still lose my progress?
bought, on, xbox, So good i bought it on xbox.
paying, for, game, 02/21 Edit: I wish I could give a lower rating. Emailed contact to report the save game bug, and got no response for several weeks after many follow-ups. Does anyone actually work there? Save files broken. As others have commented, there is a common but that renders your saves and the whole game unplayable. Reconsider paying for this game until a fix is released.
Stuck, on, screen, Good game but i cann't play it now. Stuck on the loading screen. Please fix it.
play, on, HP, This is the best game ever... The first time I watched a YouTuber played this game... I always wanted to play it on HP... Now I can play the game that I love👍👍👍
played, in, time, One of the most fun games I have played in a long time. I am very picky with what I download, and even more picky with what I will pay for. This is worth every penny and just great all around. Love the gameplay, the art, the strategy. Such a good game!

comes, from, fact, I have to say that the game look really nice and the game animation is done really well. My gripe comes from the fact that there is no tutorial to show you what to do. I got 2 levels in an realized I didn't know how to progress. If a Tut could be added I think this would improve the game experience.

see, to, it, This game has so much more potential than what is currently here, yet the devs don't seem to be aware of that. It needs bug fixes and some new content(even paid dlc would be good) because at the moment the best things about Bad North are the atmosphere and soundtrack. This is meant to be a game not a movie so see to it.
worked, on, s10, Awesome little game, worked fine on my s10+
became, in, progression, I'm really disappointed that this games experience is awsome but it's full of bugs and crashes specially freezes, the game lags even though the phone is capable of running it.. the first phases seems fine but while in progression the game became sluggish or laggy.. it's unplayable.. FIX THIS DEV DONT LET THIS GAME DIE ITS A MASTERPIECE!! Or else.. i will do some drastic measures to refund my money or worst..
come, with, levels, Lots of fun with nice graphics. The touch controls are perfect and easy to handle. I hope they come up with more levels or a sequel.
played, on, switch, Great game! I played it on switch originally but it feels more at home on pure mobile.

load, on, day, Terrible. Won't load my saved games on day 2. Freezes on loading islands and I have to restart. Waste of $$$ don't buy you have been warned
change, on, spot, Great strategy game, you have to change your positions on the spot and make last second decisions or else you lose. It's very cool and the trait system is especially unique.
stay, on, device, Fantastic game, but now my 5 star became a 1 because no save games stay on my device. Once I close the game I have to restart a whole new campaign. Will not play the game like this.
waiting, for, min, So, I' ve been waiting for like 30 min. and my campaign doesn't load. How is it that you don't fix it inmediately, but you do make money out of it. Shame on you !
stuck, on, screen, Like many others, this game was awesome for a day until my game got stuck on loading screen forever no matter what i do. Made new game, after a time the same problem happend. Reached out to Devs, we will see what they say about it. 1 of 5 until resolved. Game itself is awesome until this happens.

get, because, bugs, Nice attempt at what could be a fun game, but it just CANNOT save your games correctly. I've yet to get very far at all because of bugs and glitches with my games. Once it loaded me at the correct place, but it took all my upgrades away, so I was dead in the water. Other times it just crashed my file and deleted it. Another I reached a check point, died, attempted to reload at the check point I reached, but it took me back to the previous point so I lost all of my progress. Terrible.

log, to, game, I love this game but I'm very frustrated with it at the moment, because all of a sudden I can't log in to the game. I am stuck at the screen that has the title and the start button and it won't allow me to press the start button, or more rather, it doesn't do anything when I push the start button, I will give this five stars whenever I am able to actually log in. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and the whole lot so if it could be fixed, I would be more than happy to give a good review.

play, through, thing, Doesn't actually save your game between sessions, so unless you want to play through the whole thing in one sitting, avoid.

stuck, in, screen, Game is incredible, super fun and brutal. My one little problem is that sometimes I'll get stuck in an infinite loading screen. Besides that, one of the best games you could get on your phone.

stacking, for, game, It NEEDS replay value, if I complete the campaign the end should some stacking bonus for the new game. It's hard (but ez). I like the unit animations, to me that react to environmental happenings like real warriors would. The special abilities were meh and hard to execute (in 4 campaigns I'm yet to really nail a plunging attacking). I'd like to see this game with some pay to win purchasables and a REWARD for getting to the end

enjoy, on, tablet, An interesting take on unit squad-style RTS games with nice graphics. I think I would enjoy it more on a tablet as it feels a bit tiny on a phone screen.

stuck, in, screen, Have hit an unfortunate bug that effectively renders the game unplayable, which is unfortunate given it is otherwise a very fun game. Gets stuck in an endless loading screen (while the game is "generating islands") for saved games of difficulty "normal" or higher. A quick search reveals this is a very common bug. Will be seeking a refund.
pushed, In, addition, Very simple and entertaining. I wish there was a way to go back without losing progress. In addition, once I finished, it pushed me back to a checkpoint and didn't save my completion which was disappointing. However, even after finishing it, I am still suggesting others to play!
keep, for, time, Great strategy game, lots of stuff to unlock. It will keep you busy for a long time and it can be quite hard for challenging seeking players.
pay, for, games, Not worth $5 at all, cool little game but way too basic to charge $5, i never pay for games i wish i didnt pay for this one.

stuck, in, screen, A month after playing the game a problem occurred. I'm always stuck in the loading screen. PLEASE FIX THIS I REALLY LOVE THE GAME!!!
start, from, zero, Basically an intriguing game. It's a bit frustrating though having to start from zero if your leaders die. Nobody who is at a certain gameplay level wants to start all over again.
gets, in, levels, Definitely not worth $5. Great concept and enjoyable game play (for the most part). Though it gets rather frustrating in later levels that feel more luck based than actual skill based. This is even more apparent when the enemies are all stronger than your mostly maxed troops on top if the enemies getting access to stupidly powerful troop types that you don't get. But if you can get while it's on sale than I'd say get it.

boring, to, me, Fantastic graphics, goog game mechanics, but kindo' boring to me.
load, into, campaign, Its really simple and good but the only downside is that it takes sooooooooooooooooo long to load. Please fix this. I literally had to wait 40 minutes for it to load up into my campaign. I really love the commander part of the game.The grunts they make when you press them. The upgrades feel satisfying. Its very well made. Just do fix the loading problem.
stuck, at, screen, Loved it at first, but can't load saved games - getting stuck at the loading screen like everyone else.
stuck, at, screen, The game is ok but got stuck at loading screen. Had to uninstall.
stuck, at, screen, Great game until it doesn't allow you to play it. As others have stated, there's a bug where you get stuck at the load screen and you're not allowed to continue your saved game. Of course this issue doesn't stop the devs from charging you $5 for the privilege of downloading the app. Would be nice to get some premium bug fixes for the premium price. Edit: after a quick Google search, it appears this issue isn't exclusive to mobile. It's happening on PC and Switch platforms also. Yikes.

pauses, in, time, It pauses in the worst time ever
log, in, reward, Would be a 5. Its smooth, balanced, simple. But there needs to be eofferent game modes, and a store maybe, log in reward, and more classes.
recommend, on, flights, Really fun game, possibly my favourite on mobile. Easy to pass a lot of time with, especially recommend on long flights/journeys!
beat, in, experience, I regret buying this game. $5 is too much for a game that is so frustrating at times. It has A LOT of potential, great graphics and gameplay, but difficulty scales exponentially. The final map has been impossible to beat in my experience. Codex has no information about how skills, items or traits actually work. There is no info whatsoever about the enemies, the fact that Brutes are so f** powerful, and show up out of nowhere, make it impossible to prepare. Some combo of enemies are just stupid.
blocking, with, item, It's a great game. Though there are some bugs with the clouds (a small cloud blocking an island with an item on it.)
add, to, it, This is an actual good game. It is a good strategy game that is a lot of fun. My only wish is that they add more to it. Maybe even let the player be the raiders in a different mode. It's still a lot of fun. I mainly enjoyed it cause i don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on it to win and no ads. If you hate this game than your bad at adjusting to different foes. I really like the late game when it gets more challenging. And again if any creators see this. Please add more. It ended so fast.

like, about, game, The only thing i dont like about this game is that it takes forever to load other than that it is a great game
beat, on, difficultly, This game is very fun and a bit addictive . Makes you want to beat the game on all the difficultly and get the best rolls and items to have the best soilders
exceeding, At, completion, At 23% campaign completion, loading times on startup are exceeding ten minutes. With great service, or with great wifi. It's unplayable at this point.
start, from, Square, Doesnt save progress, have to start from Square one everytime you play. Huge flaw
redownloading, down, line, Really wanted to like this game, but half the time the buttons didn't work 😑. Would def consider redownloading a few updates down the line.
do, with, variety, Great game, could do with added variety
pay, for, campaign, Awesome but not enough. I would be willing to pay for another campaign, or something. I played through the. Campaign twice and want more. Amazing game. Maybe a survival mode... Or a mode that allows more than 4 units. Just an incredible game. I'm excited to. See more.

throw, at, times, make u you want to throw your phone away at times. All in all a pretty good game
is, to, it, Amazing game! Very easy to pick up. I thought it was simplistic at first but there is a lot of nuance to it. Units utilize a sort of rock/paper/scissors power structure (shields defeat archers, archers defeat swordsmen, pikes defeat shields, etc). There are also cool downs for different units and upgrades to make them stronger. Overall a well constructed fun game with awesome graphics.
gaming, for, hours, This is definitely worth the purchase. Has kept me gaming for hours and would recommend to anyone thinking about buying it. Do it

going, over, place, Very good until late game, when it becomes extremely frustrating. Partly because it was so good earlier, you expect it to keep being that. But once the big vikings show up, it stops making any sense: your guys just get going about all over the place and you have to react very fast, but it's so easy to select the wrong group. I found many of the late battles almost random - just repeat several times until you get through, without it being exactly clear why. It's a different, frustrating game.
restart, after, day, It caused my phone to stop working kinda freaked out but I found a way to restart my phone after a day... kinda want a refund
run, with, friends, Loved the game guys!!! I run a small design studio Non Zero, with my friends ( Insta handle - @nonzero.space ). Let's talk, would love to collab with you folks!

play, for, 25hrs+, This game is fantastic. Very smooth and pleasant gameplay, and challenging enough to play for a good 25hrs+.
sits, on, screen, I want a refund it won't load it just sits on a black screen.
recommend, to, anyone, This game is by far the best mobile game I have ever played, i would recommend it to anyone. Five stars all the way!
result, in, experience, Mixed feelings. Nice and simple gameplay, cool minimal graphics, but irrationally long loading times and inadequate onboarding/instructions, that result in an overall mediocre experience.
got, Regarding, islands, Regarding the "generating islands" bug: I got it as well from time to time but simple deleting the cache will make it work again! That's why i also only give 4 stars, it is pretty annoying when it happens but can easily be fixed. The game itself is great though! Works very well on mobile (I've played it before on PC)

topped, with, graphics, Excellent FTL style roguelike strategy gameplay, simple yet interesting realtime combat topped with minimalistic beautiful graphics. Without irritating adds, because of tiny fixed buying price. This is how I wish more mobile games should be like!
tends, like, others, It's a good game, but like others, it tends to get stuck on the loading screen.

freezes, after, hours, The gaming experience is awesome. But after couple hours it constantly freezes. Looks like you are leaking memory
fix, with, power, This is a really, really fun strategy game. I love the way it simplifies the RTS-style game play so it is more accessible for mobile. The only problem I have encountered is the extremely high battery consumption (a little over 20% per hour). If they can fix that with a low power setting this will be very worthy of five stars!
stuck, on, screen, Really love the game - it's both casual but interesting enough to feel invested. Have reduced a star because I am getting the same bugs as others, is getting stuck on the loading screen when trying to load a game for instance which is frustrating. But when you can actually get into the game it's fantastic!

replied, to, email, Fix your game devs! DO NOT BUY THIS. The game is totally broken and they haven't replied to the email I sent for a refund. Google really shouldn't be allowing this game in the Play Store in this state. The game doesn't save, it doesn't keep unlocks and it gets stuck generating islands. Great gameplay let down by being a totally broken game. It's a complete scam that this has been a problem from launch, it's not been fixed and the devs do not reply. The 5* reviews surely cannot be real.

Tried, across, devices, Fun game, until it refuses to load. Tried across multiple devices, it cannot load saved games, or even start a new one.
killing, in, middle, Really great game. Good depth of stategy, just couldn't put the game down. Would have been really really difficult if you couldn't save your commanders by just killing the app in the middle of a battle. Best part, no pay to play!
spent, on, game, This is by far the best $5 bucks I ever spent on a mobile game I love everything about it the simplicity with a twist. Great game 10 stars
translates, for, gaming, Refreshing strategy game that translates well for mobile gaming! A must play!
leaving, for, bit, Really awesome rogue-like + RTS game, but not one you have to love RTS's to get into. Feels and looks really great and the mechanics feel very well thought out. Also a lot of replay value. It's one I find myself leaving for a bit and then coming back to again again. Matches are reasonably short too, so good game for on the go. Personally I think it's one of the best mobile rogue-likes around.
stuck, on, islands, Same problem as others, game loads fine the first time but after exiting the game it no longer loads. Gets stuck on "generating islands". So yeah unplayable.
slow, by, end, This game shows how you don't need flashy gameplay, complicated mechanics, or high-end graphics to make a fun and entertaining games. I recommend you get it. The five dollars are worth it. Just warning you all though. This game tends to slow down by the end of the game and this is only made worse if you have multiple save files(in my case I only had two). If you delete most of your save files and keep one, your game will speed up significantly.
come, Over, time, Really well developed game mechanics, immersive music, and graphics. Doesn't take long to figure out the basics. Over time new strategic nuances come to light. I am hooked. Worth the investment.

discovered, on, Pass, Excellent streamlined RTS. I first discovered this gen on Xbox Game Pass, and I had to buy the mobile edition because it's such a perfect fit.
stuck, in, islands, Excellent game, was worth the $5. The gameplay, skill unlocks, and upgrade economy all work well together. This would be a 5 star game, except it's now stuck in the "generating islands" load screen.
attack, on, toooo$$$$, Can we do attack on another island toooo$$$$
Challenging, to, me, It was really a cool game, I passed on easy! Challenging to me on normal but one request to the devs, please, please make a new game+ option.

recommend, for, timers, Intuitive, simple, with a high skill ceiling for those who wish to reach it. Cannot recommend for RTS first timers to veterans alike. Hope to see studio grow and make more.

finished, on, easy, I just finished the game on easy and dispite some annoying bugs, I have to say this was a beautifully crafted strategy game that does not disappoint. Well worth the price. I'm definitely playing through again on all the difficulty settings.

had, on, phone, Great game! Haven't had any issues on my moto phone. I think the tutorial really helps you understand the gameplay, even if their aren't many instructions. This is possibly one of my favorite strategy games! Thanks!
match, against, foes, This is a really good RTS if you are more into puzzles than stressful RTS. There are some roguelike elements as well, but you can turn them off if you like. But the game itself is really good, the way you need to match troops against certain foes, and also positioning them correctly. And as you progress in the game, that becomes more and more important and more difficult to pull off.

switch, from, app, Yeeeeah seriously guys, I LOVE the game, but even if I just switch from this app to another for a minute or so, game reloads when I pull it back up, aaaaaaand u go to load ur save(was 2hrs into campaign), and as others have said, at the "generating islands" part, NOTHING HAPPENS, music even fades out I noticed...... (UPDATED REVIEW), Weeellllllll, seems they fixed the problem, at least I didn't have it any more, so when WORKING, great game(If a short??)

gets, like, some, Great game, but like some of the other reviews, it gets stuck on the "generating islands" screen. Once you have played for the first time, exited out of the app, and try to go back and play again, the app won't let you. So I would give this app a five star review, but because of this problem I can't play it.

run, at, enemies, Great art style and gameplay loop held back by no pause or fast forward button. Sometimes troops take the long way around, sometimes they run straight at the enemies. AI isn't consistent
becomes, After, retries, After 3-4 retries it becomes frustrating. Starting from a checkpoint does not let you advance in the game if your situation is not good enough, so they are useless in many cases. Good and addictive game anyway.

see, in, codex, Great game, highly recommend for others to buy, would love to see enemy's pic and description in the codex. Teach me how to make these please 🙏
tests, from, horde, A great challenging game that tests your skill in strategic battles over the pillaging of islands from a viking horde.
making, for, minutes, Really great game, beautiful graphics but I was only able to play about three levels without the game crashing and making my phone unusable for a few minutes. I bought it on steam afterwards and really enjoyed it.

Scavenging, For, Game, I have Been Scavenging the App Store For a Strategic Game like This, The Maps are Beautiful, it makes Actual Sense, and Overall Good Quality, but I really wish there was a Sandbox Mod, where You Can Create Your Own Levels, Besides from that, I recommend that you get This Game
spiking, for, island, Clever, original game with great replay ability but the difficultly does have a habit of spiking dramatically for the final island
completed, on, phone, I completed the game once on my phone and then it just wont go beyond the start button when i tried to play again.

stuck, at, screen, Absolutely love the game. But the game is stuck at loading screen after I reached 50% in a campaign run. This being a paid game, this loading issue is a huge dealbreaker.

loops, in, islands, Careful, your savegames can become unusable! I don't know what happened but after exiting the app and loading the savegame it loops forever in "Generating islands". Now I can't play that campaign :(
hope, for, mode, Love the game just hope for an endless mode
asks, for, amount, Amazing port, appreciate the ability to restart a level. Very engaging and it asks for "just" the right amount of time!
had, on, PS, I love this game! I haven't experienced any crashes and I hope I dont. I never had any problems with it on PS.
stand, at, island, The gameplay is interesting and the mechanics are simple. But the game virtually impossible. Four units with items and lots of upgrades, but can't even stand a chance at the checkpoint island. Like, not even close. Lost most of it's fun when it feels like the enemies get better than you faster than you possibly can.
played, for, mins, Such an enjoyable game. Can be played for 5 mins or an hour and so addictive.
Need, with, levels, Need more content only 3 classes with three levels pretty ordinary for a payed game need more specialized units why can't we have giants or javelin throwers or dual welders ,axe men throwing axe men it wouldn't be difficult assets are already in game would make replayable Or weapon specializations archer to crossbow Or pikemen to with sheild or more armour Soo many things I stop playing after the second checkpoint got too boring playing on hard aswell
lacks, in, amount, Its a very sweet and well thought through, little game. What it lacks in the amount of content, it makes up in its artwork and gameplay.

played, for, total, Great game played for a total of half an hour and now it won't load my saved data, it's stuck on generating island. This seems a common bug and totally ruins the game. Please fix it soon, but from the comments I can't see it happening any time soon.
pay, for, game, I didnt pay for a game that gets absolutely 0 content updates. Its was fun for about a week but its completely lost its replay ability. Might as well download the free knock off versions. You get the exact same experience as this one.
played, on, mobile, Best strategy game I've ever played on mobile, its the only mobile game I would actually sit down and play when I have something else to do.
manage, in, game, Great game, would require a few tweaks with the ability to change difficulty in-game, manage multiple saving points *in-game* and not only between islands, undo button for upgrades, ability to change speeds.
work, on, tutorial, Need some updates and work on tutorial, except that, it's cool
share, with, people, i think this kind a game should add sandbox mode so you can make your own island, wave, and you can share the levels with other people. please make this sandbox this will be so much fun to play not just boring
see, because, camera, I love the game on PC so I bought it here. I can't see a damn thing because of the camera. Let me be able to zoom farther in to view troops. (I have a Pixel XL 2.) It'd also be nice if there were additional options for controlling units like removing the need to tap time on a square to move.

charged, for, 10, Great game. Just don't know why I was charged three times or it and again for $10... Prolly gonna sue tbh UPDATE: They refunded the extra money they charged with no word, but now my game gets stuck loading my last save...

get, into, games, Not cheap, but enjoyed playing. However now I can't get into my saved games, it just endlessly 'loads islands' so must be a bug. Based on when the last update unfortunately I'm not sure this will be fixed anytime soon.
sit, at, 1, It Won't Save Any More! It's an brilliant little game, love it but I haven't been able to save recently which has become extremely annoying. Normally I would give 5 stars but this needs to be addressed so till then it sit at 1
crashed, on, me, No matter what from I've seen it's a great game but when just got it I tried to start a new campaign but every time I did it crashed on me sadly
uses, with, cooldown, A good blend of RTS and Roguelike. Also, a nice take on FTL-like games. I hope there would be more updates in the future. Suggestions: 1. Bigger maps with more deployable units. 2. New units: - Engineer (uses crossbow with longer cooldown than archer / active ability builds barricades) 3. New Enemies: - Goliath (single siege-type unit / high HP / slow ) 4. Revision of Swordman skill to Shield Wall from Jump Attack (I rarely use the Jump Attack) 5. A mode where you can be the Vikings instead.
runs, except, time, I am one to find mobile games tedious. This game is the best mobile game I ever played. A very simple strategy game with rpg or rogue like elements. It's this that makes it so good and progressively enjoyable as you upgrade your troops. Graphics are perfect. I give this 4.5 stars. The game runs perfect for me except one time I could not load a save which i think is a problem for some but I wasn't bothered much. I wish this game was longer, more enemies and different units.
updated, for, mode, Game has good graphics more challenging if it is possible it can be updated for multiplayer mode i know its tough job but where friends can play together on somewhat big map and communicate with each other i need help big horde incoming 😅 might be fun.

paying, for, experience, Great game when it works, but currently disappointing and not worth paying money for the experience. As of right now, I get stuck on the start screen and I can't get past it, even if I press start. This happens whether I have wifi connection, or no internet connection at all. Sounds like other people have had similar issues about getting stuck in certain screens as well. Gameplay is great, but haven't been able to play since I shelled out money for it.

get, past, page, I really like this app but it won't let me get past the start page. It won't let me press start and all it does is play the music and let me click on the cross which lets you quit. It is strange because this doesn't happen on any other devices 🤷🏼‍♀️ but they are on a different account so I don't know.

run, at, 60fps, An incredible mix of realtime strategy in a rogue like environment. The gameplay is simple but its mechanics make it deep enough. The mobile port is perfect for this game. The difficulties are well balanced and they give a fair level of challenge to the player. Graphics and art look simple at first, but the details make this game unique and enjoyable. Appreciated the option to set the game to run at 60fps (default 30fps) that gives an even more smooth experience thanks to great animations.
resume, from, save, Beautiful...but needs a fix. 79% done and I can't resume from my save. Stuck on loading screen. Devs don't seem to be involved with support, as I have tried emailing them with no avail. Wish I can finish this amazing game someday!

access, to, menu, The game infinitely loads my save file. Also, sometimes I can't access to main menu because "start" button doesn't work.
press, at, times, Love the game when it works, menu screen start wont press at times leaving it unplayable. Loading islands will get a endless loading screen. But its a toss up if itll work or not. Disapointed plz fix will give 5 stars, This is a lg stylo 4 phone
looking, at, it, I'm a huge Total War fan and I was skeptical at first from looking at it but this is a phenomenal game that stands out on its own and has really fun strategy aspects unlike most other games out there.

take, with, processor, Really good game if you have a good phone to run it. because the generating islands part does take a while even with my octa core processor. Decent replayability. Strangely anti climatic ending.. just my oppinion. I wish there was a bit more content for its price. But the music and artstyle does make up for that.

recovered, after, point, So the game play is good but I think some fundamental changes are required. You collect armies as you go, but when you deploy you don't get an option to choose which armies can be deployed, which doesn't make any sense. It can't always be all or nothing. You should be able to go back in the map, if army is fatigued then there should be a time after which point they are fully recovered. Lots of options are binary. Need to fix those
seem, past, point, The game is brilliant, really fun and great for on the go play. I am having the same issues as everyone else; past a certain point it doesn't seem to load my save game and is stuck on 'generating islands'. Tragic as the game gets more interesting the longer you play. Annoying as it's a paid for game.

moved, from, mis)representation, It's not a bad game but it gets quite repetitive. Also I get it that it's a game and a fictionalised universe, but I thought we moved on from the (mis)representation of Vikings as bloodthirsty brutes.

hold, onto, coins, Wow. I absolutely love this game. It's definitely difficult, make sure to hold onto your coins and save the trinkets for until you've figured out your groove. I highly recommend using the ring (increases clan size by 16) for an Archer. That saved my butt a few times. Beautiful and very well made.

played, on, device, One of the best games I have ever played on a mobial device yet like many people I am experiencing the same issues as other where it gets stuck on generating islands when loading up the game, this prevents you from ever getting to the endgame without playing it all in one sitting, the most disappointing thing is the dev's have not even responded to other comments saying they are trying to fix it, dev's own up to your mistake and fix it so we can all enjoy this wonderful game again.

HATE, about, it, I absolutely love this game but what I HATE about it is that each time I go back I can never go back in again so I have to delete it and reinstall it. AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK
fracas, with, innocence, Not trusted, very much a cookoo, a Trojan horse to history, the present, and the good of the future, moral standing, and all our dreams. The people who are into this game are very much toxic, and would make ill and cause gripe and fracas with innocence and a weakened person. Do not trust this game, or whatever toxin is its support base. There are so many other ways of good fun, without the massive risk and threats this game and it's toxic community would level at you, thus making you unhapsome 2

try, in, months, Great game but too buggy will try again in a few months
playing, on, medium, Had a blast playing through on medium and then hard without restarts, very well balanced charming game, hard was challenging without being too ridiculous. Very hard, however is just really cheap and infuriating, got to turn 6-7 thinking it was challenging but still enjoyable, after that it's just silly. Veteran archers whittled down to 2 men from high ground by 6 enemy archers Veteran spearmen overrun through a choke point by basic militia.... Not carrying on to see how stupid the rest will be.

going, for, year, It doesn't save! This problem has apparently been going on for almost a year. Fix this problem! It is a great game but very frustrating! Edit: Just did a new campaign to see if it saves. When I exit and come back in, I have to start a new campaign??? What a shame
hopped, on, today, Help! I love this game. But yesterday I was playing regularly and when I hopped back on today, I m stuck loading my save. The islands are generating forever and I cant continue playing. I tried restarting my phone and even re downloading the game. No luck. Please help me!
come, with, strategy, Great game! Fun strategy that requires you to think and understand the behavior of the units and come up with strategy. Bugs: It's now almost impossible to play, as nearly every click opens up the menu. I'll go back to 5 stars when the game works. Update: Sometimes clicks in games will get miss mapped, going to odd locations on the map, often the menu. Update 2: Added to this, now the game won't start. Update 3: after reinstall, game still won't start, it gets stuck on "generating islands"

pay, for, ups, This is one of the best strategy games I've found. The gameplay is enjoyable, the art is fantastic, if you screw up, your game is basically over... Like you have to restart... decisions are critical, you pay dearly for screw ups, though it's not so bad that by other good decisions you can't recover. There is a ton of variety, so you can play through again with completely different results. It's awesome, more than worth the price.

get, about, halfway, Great game until you get about halfway through and then it refuses to load. Weird bug that everyone seems to be experiencing now.
see, on, ads, One of the best games on the Play Store - not very expensive either? Easy to pick up, this beautiful indie game is very well done. Shows the sort of games phones can support - and way better than any of those crappy games you see on ads on YouTube! I highly recommend it if you like RTS strategy games. All I would've liked extra was a bit more content - maybe more types of unit, and maybe add fortifiable buildings in some maps? Would make the endgame of each campaign more interesting!

feed, on, many, Would have left a higher review because the game is loads of fun, but after you're about 40% through you can't load the game if you're coming back. It does load a save if you don't have much progress. But the real issue I have is no developer feed back on many of the other comments with the same issue.

see, on, comments, The game is pretty fun itself. But there is a lot of technical issues. And you would expect a paid game to be complete. I see on comments everyone is having technical issues. Mine is i can play a new game no problem, but when i try to load a saved game it gets stuck on generating world loading screen...
plan, during, action, Excellent game, nice design, mechincs and graphics. Looks very simple but actually forces you to think and plan during not only the action but during the sailing. 5/5. Would highly recommend.
stuck, on, island, This game is awesome! Up to the point you come back to load your game and that the loading screen is stuck on "generating island". So every time you succed to go far in the game, you have to restart from the very beginning. So you can't ever finish the game because of that stupid bug. I would rate it 5 star if I could finish the game.

Played, for, total, Great to play... Until it stopped working. Played this game for a total of a few hours... Now it will not load. Gets stuck on building the islands. Waited 10+ minutes, I've uninstalled and installed again. Sent email to developer a month ago, and no response. No recent updates to the app. Even trying a new campaign let me play a bit, and now does the same thing. Would love to play this game more, and rate it higher, but if I can't play it, it won't get more than 2 stars.
enthralled, in, game, Every time I open this game I know I'm going to have a good time because I am always enthralled in this game.
playing, on, Xbox, Excellent real-time strategy game, reminds me of playing Ruse on Xbox back in the day. Love the graphics, fine gameplay. No complaints.

stuck, on, screen, The game is awesome but since i finished the campaign in easy mode and i try to reload it. It wont open. It gets stuck on the loading screen.
Cool, at, design, Cool at design and graphics. Combined with the strategy and to notch production, I would highly recommend to anyone who likes strategy games.

brought, into, battle, Great App, but it drains battery kind of fast Also an endless mode would be nice and an option to increase the amount of units allowed to be brought into battle
looking, at, gameplay, I made the mistake of not looking at the gameplay before making my purchase. I was under the impression you were the vikings. It's still a neat concept. However a version where you play the Vikings landing on European islands would be awesome.

asking, for, dollars, This game has no right to be asking for over 5 dollars for what amounts to be a simple time waster with no depth. Worth 99 cents tops.
play, to, avail, Really want to give this 4 or maybe 5, but it's too buggy. It can take a long time for the game to become responsive when starting up again, I've waited several minutes for it to generate maps and let me play again, to no avail. Edit, I'm a recent player, the game has been updated, but the bugs remain. Starting to wonder if positive reviews are for other platforms or paid.
force, in, currency, Love the game! Worth every penny! Doesn't force any ads or in game currency. I highly suggest you download
own, on, PC, I own this on both PC and Xbox, and still prefer it on my phone, it is perfect for the medium and great to play on the go. There's never been a game more perfect for a port.

Coming, off, back, Can't praise this game highly enough. Coming off the back of my first completion (medium difficult) absolutely buzzing because I won with 5 troops left. Controls are perfect, AI is mind-blowing, customisation of army is spot on, graphics are clean, it's a real challenge (I haven't even tried hard yet) but very rewarding, no in-app purchases or adverts - which ironically makes me want to throw money at the devs. 10/10, also made in Unity which is the dankest game engine.

pay, for, this, Love it! The gameplay is great, graphics are charming. And best of all, the business model is great. It's great to see that some Devs still make games that people want to play instead of trying to make games so boring that people pay to skip. Thank you. Happy to pay for this!
controls, Like, campaign, Great game! Super fun. Are you planning to add a new class? Like maybe a heavy shield class or something? Just curious. Also would multiplayer be available soon? Like regular campaign except 1 person controls 1 squad and the other person controls the 2nd squad. If so multiplayer should be a lot harder due to more available friendly squads and traits. So it would make sense to make it much harder but keep the same campaign format. Other then those questions amazing and fun game!
load, into, save, Wonderful little game. Having an issue where the game won't load back into a previous save which is annoying. But this is after a full play through which was huge fun.
played, for, weeks, Absolutely awesome game! I played this game for a few weeks on Xbox One and enjoyed it. When I saw it in the Play Store, I absolutely had to have it. I'm a few days in and still loving it!

get, on, console, The game is fun an enjoyable on console, but this mobile version kinda kept kicking me out of the game. Eventually it didnt let me open the game. Love it but I would like a refund to try to get it again on console.
have, to, game, I don't know what you guys did, but now i can have acces to my saved game, maybe a quick top view option can be helpfull to see the overall game fighting
recommend, to, people, Like it very much. Can recommend to people who like well designed strategies)
having, with, loading, This game should be higher than a 4.0 rating because it is absolutely fantastic. People rate it poorly not because the gameplay is terrible. They've just been unfortunate of having issues with the game loading or their saved data going corrupt, but not me. The game is phenomenally addicting and yet challenging. It's never the same, so you'll have new and fun challenges to experience. Money well spent.
hold, in, unit, This is an amazing game wich there is none other like. But I would say that they should ad were if you hold in the unit (pikemen and swordsmen)where you can do formations such as the phalanx. And should add more modes for example. A creative mode where you can make your own island or defend agaisnt zombies or where you are the Vikings and you attack. They should also add PvP wich would be so fun. Anyway it's a good game and its worth the five bucks. Good luck

sitting, in, bed, Lovely game. Perfect combination of relaxation and strategy for me. I just love sitting in bed and whipping this game out for a quick sesh. No ads and no nonsense thus far. Also, the music really pulls me in. Great job guys and gals!

suffers, from, problem, I love this game. Scaled down rts with short battles so you can just do one game and drop it. Sadly it suffers from the same problem other rts do, namely that you give an order and the units dont do it well. Here, for example, everytime I tell a commander to flee he still fights with anyone around him, sometimes going out of his way and costing his life. Why? Also, the game recognizes when I connect/disconnect a controller, yet none of the buttons work and it doesn't allow me to map buttons.

pay, on, Store, One of the best games to pay for on the whole Play Store! Great graphics and gameplay. You can play the game over and over again and the games difficulty isn't easy which make you concentrate on the gameplay. Strategy is key here.

repeat, since, checkpoint, Very well made game! The only annoyance is that you have to repeat all levels since the last checkpoint in case you fail a level.

get, into, game, Excellent game, but as of right now i cant get into the game. Hopefully the devs patch this fantastic game. Its a small strategic war game. Whats not to love.
lost, about, halfway, A great little game with lovely graphics and pitch perfect level of difficulty, treading the line well between being too punishing and too easy. I'd easily give the game 4 or even 5 stars but I've just encountered the save file bug that means I've just lost my progress about halfway through the campaign. For me, the loading screen gets stuck whilst "generating islands". Looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this issue and it's a shame as it's a blight on an otherwise we'll made game.

add, in, crossbow, Love the game but can you add in a crossbow unit(archers with a long ranged weapon and can be in melee) raider unit(uses a 2 handed battle axe and looks like a viking but has alot of health and only has a squad of 4) and a calvary unit which is infantry on horseback or halberders(which are heavy armoured infantry with a shield and a halbed)

load, after, hours, Great game, but after 4 hours i cant load a game. Creating new game doesnt wokr either.. Please, could you do some fix?
played, on, mobile, One of the best games I have played on mobile spent two days since the time of purchase invested in this. So much fun we'll worth the money. Only suggestion would be if you could switch sides and be the bad guys aswel and if you could unlock the ability to use your entire army not just 4 teams per turn.

stays, on, screen, Good game but doesnt load the game up just stays on the load screen
Looking, at, map, The tutorial could be better. I've just had Game Over despite winning all my battles because the "Vikings cut off my retreat". Looking at the map I can see why but it wasn't something mentioned before, so I wasn't paying any attention to where I was. This was a shame as I was otherwise doing well.
linked, with, game, It is a very well thought out game. I'm still enjoying the gameplay as well. However I don't know if it is my personal account that is linked with the game or the game itself but it doesn't save my progress. Everytime I go back on to the game I have to create my lords and start again.

open, in, screen, I love strategic games like this, the graphic itself is good, easy to play and understand what is this game is all about. The controls are good too but one thing. Sometimes when I open the game in the front screen, the start button can't click or what, mostly it can't be click the "START" button. Please fix this because I like the game itself and lastly I paid for it.
works, for, me, The concept and the game itself is awesome! It works properly for me, I didn't encounter any of the reported issues after playing the game for 3 hours straight. Raw Fury keep up the good work!

reset, to, color, The graphic has problem. When the island starts, the sea is all black, need to zoom in and out to reset it to the correct color. When rotate the island, a black shadow of the shape of the island will be left in the sea, also need to zoom in and out to reset it back to normal. The gameplay is great though, would've been 5 stars if no graphic issues.

crashes, at, screen, Game crashes all the time. Never played more than 20 minutes. It lags then forced close. Also happened when loading one of the saved game, crashes everytime at the loading screen. Like the game style, but the bugs are killing it

recommend, to, fan, What a wonderful game! The controls are fluid and intuitive, the graphics easy to see and the game play is simple yet deep. I definitely felt like I got my money's worth and will play this game until it gets old. One of the best premium games I have ever played, and I will definitely recommend it to any fan of the genre.
CONTINUE, FROM, FILE, !!! THIS GAME IS GREAT !!! BUT 1 CAN'T CONTINUE FROM A SAVE FILE. FIX SAVE !!! Ps few game are unique enough they become their own genres... This game is one of those games. DEVS, don't spoil this it is gold. FIX BUG, CREATE CONTENT.
love, about, it, This is by far one of the best strategy games in store at the moment. I love everything about it.. beautiful animations, music, game atmosphere. Starts easy and works it's way to being hard. Seriously well done and worth the paying for a game!
putting, into, it, I'm pretty angry right now. The game was fun and I started putting some hours into it but I accidentally deployed my commanders and realized I sent too many, so I clicked flee island to restart it. It just ****ing ended my whole game and all those hours were wasted. Stuppppiiiiid mechanic. Make sure you give warnings. Not sure if I'll try again. Ffs.
put, of, game, Unfortunately despite being an excellent game... it does not have a proper save game function. Whenever I come put of the game there is no autosave or save function. As a result you lose all progress. Very frustrating. Its like playing mega drive games again unable to end the session and worried about the thing overheating...

justified, with, version, I feel there is a lot of negative comments that WERE justified with an older version back in the day, but I enjoyed a stable game without a single issue. Is this game worth $5, yes. You'll probably get 4 hours play time out of it as once played through it lacks depth or breadth for replayability. What is it lacking for 5 stars? additional game play, quests and one additional class like a long Bowman. Otherwise, worth the spend and 4 stars.

Coming, from, someone, Loving the game! Smooth game play, no issues at all. Coming from someone who has never played the game, I would like is a bit more explanation of the commander abilities and enemy icons. Other than that great job!
go, through, campain, I really enjoy this game. The gamplay is strategic with a touch of RPG. What I really like is that it is relaxing to play but ass you go through the campain it gets more intense. If you like the game Polytopia you will like this game.
read, before, purchasing, Was really enjoying the game, until my save stopped loading. Reading other reviews it seems to be a common problem, wish I'd read before purchasing
speeding, in, oleds, The art and everything is amazing. Though i only have a small gripe with the app and that is the inability to fill my screen. Hehe please do fix this, i want to play the game without worrying about speeding up the screen burnin issue in oleds
purchased, in, hours, I've contacted developers regarding refunding their app that I've purchased in the less than 3 hours before. They flatout refuse to refund me. They have been reported to the Play Store team. I'm hoping that this issue gets resolved in the near future.

done, with, it, I love this game and the developers have done a great job with it. My only issue with the game in any sense is the infinite loading issue. It needs to be fixed immediately. Apart from that, this game is worth the money
load, after, days, Bloody saves won't load after two days. Beautiful game ruined...
Love, about, game, Love everything about this game except it has a hard time loading saved game files and gets stuck on 'generating islands'. Hopefully it's fixable soon.

Address, for, review, Cannot load saved game. Address this for updated review and score.
come, with, maps, Amazing game design. Fun to play. Should definitely come up with more maps with new updates.
be, at, 4.7, Incredible game. Rating be at 4.7
do, for, classes, The game is quite enjoyable in regards to gameplay. I could do for a few more classes or perhaps a deeper skill tree in what we already have. Aside from that it is worth the $5.00. My main concern and reasoning behind the 2 star is the game breaking bug that seems to have been around for a while now. Enjoyed this game until I found out my saved games will not load when coming back to play them later. All progress lost. It's totally unacceptable and I ask that something is finally done about it.

addicted, to, it, I really love this game and I am already addicted to it but can you guys use the checkpoints for us to load there so we wont lose our progress because I spent a hour playing and I thought of going to main menu to look at the Codex and continue it later but it made start a new one. Please add load files and save its really enjoyable but its tiring to keep losing your progress. Please add this ASAP.

looking, for, game, This game is a lot fun. I've been looking for a good strategy game on the store for awhile now and this is it. There are a few bugs though like when I start the game up it will crash at the start screen. There is also some lag and small bugs that could be fixed. overall though this game is worth it.

see, in, future, It's a very fun game that gets more challenging as you progress. Strategically planning the types of troops you're going to upgrade to combat the invading enemies and laying out a plan are important keys to winning a campaign. Game has high replay value. I would like to see more classes in the future such as support healers or super infantry would be cool.
get, For, reason, For some reason i can't get it to work on my phone but seems to be a good game

work, for, platform, A great game experience. A small, but full game with no additional costs beyond the initial purchase. Relatively quick scenarios (~3-5 min per island) which work well for the mobile platform. Light strategy, unit customization, and progression.
closed, in, story, excellent game but in the mid story i closed the game and when i try to load save next time its just stuck in loading screen saying generating worlds . pls fix. update i learned that only first time takes very long to load (around 10 minutes) then save works normally

I am really happy that you guys ported this for android, but please help me with this issue so I can keep playing further. Give me a solution. Thanks.

advise, with, resolution, Edit: CLEAR YOUR GAME STORAGE. Customer support helped me resolve my issue. Five star game. Fun game, but I can't resume any saved files or build progress from campaign to campaign. It's frustrating to lose progress every time I begin to play. Please advise with a resolution. I've emailed as well.
trapped, on, second, the graphics are awesome and the game play meh, but the brute archers are the most op unfair enemy and your commanders dont always do what you tell them to do. The turn based system is weird and getting trapped on the second to last island because you cant move that far is so God damn annoying. I would like a refund
playde, for, day, I playde the game for a day and it stop working
finished, in, couple, Although the game is quite fun, it is not worth 5€. The gameplay and graphics are really nice, but the game had a small soundtrack and can be finished in a couple of hours. If it ever gets on sale I would buy it.

select, in, way, Great game, though it can be a little hard to select units in a timely way. Would it be possible to get the selection bar for units on the side, like in the desktop version?

gets, past, couple, I really enjoyed this game when I first got it. Decided to start playing again so I reinstalled and now it's won't load up. It's gets past the first couple of screens and then goes to an all black screen that says "Starting..." at the top but It never loads. Can't stand paying for a game and not being able to play it. Fix your issues!

stuck, on, screen, Okay so search up what testudo means if you already know what it means I want to see the Infantry fully upgraded do that whenever arches are around please also can you fix that one thing where your screen is stuck on the main screen please
saw, on, PC, When I first saw this game on PC I thought it was too shallow and would make a much better mobile game. Now that it's on a mobile platform, I was finally able to play it and say that it's really fun and a great time-killer.
introduces, to, game, Charming and minimalistic design that introduces us to a fairly complex strategy game. Very faithful to its original PC version and one of the best titles on Google Play.
stuck, on, islands, Will not load a save game screen stuck on generating islands. Unplayable because of this Avoid till fixed
playing, for, hour, The game itself is a lot of fun and beautifully animated. The controls are intuitive and responsive. I found myself playing for about an hour before I took a break, but now when I try to load my saved game it just stays on the loading screen. No problem starting a new game, but it's frustrating losing my progress. Are there any responses on fixing this?

recommend, to, others, Brilliant game and I've really enjoy playing it and would recommend it to others ...HOWEVER less than 24hrs later after buying this game it now wont load. The game freezes for a while on the start screen when you first open the app but it eventually let's you select your saved games, ok fair enough. However then when I try to load my saved game it keeps crashing/freezing. Please if you are reading this developers, please sort out your awesome game. Its definitely worth a 5 star

sorted, After, emails, I had an issue with my purchase where I was prompted to buy the app a second time. After a few emails with the developer, we sorted out the issue. Excellent customer service and support.
tend, towards, strategy, Great mobile RTS. It's no TD and that's good! I like that each unit feels unique, can evolve and may die, permanently. The auto-slomo while a unit is selected is a great idea. As is the constant progression of the vikings on the main map, generating a sense of overall strategy. Yet it's still mainly real-time and tactical, and I tend more and more towards turn-based strategy, so...
fix, for, experience, I would rate this game 5 star but i keep gettong stuck in the loading screen please fix this bug for a better experience
get, in, data, I love this game it is so fun but I get issue in save data every day it will erase. Please help me
do, after, campaign, One of the best games on the app store. High quality and lengthy play through. Only wish there was more to do after the campaign.
carries, to, games, Love this game, such a cool concept, adorable art style and I love that you can play as little or as much as you want. There is an aspect that carries through to your future games so you have a sense of achievement but also each game is a new challenge, and I must reiterate, beutiful. Very fun and I definitely recommend
spent, in, while, smooth interface, beautiful scenery, and unforgiving gameplay. best five bucks I've spent in a while. disclosure: not a bot; libertarian living in California..lefty Valley would never program an AI with my preferences.

switched, to, models, The game is fun but i have an issue Out of nowhere it seems like the game just switched to some low quality models and the sea turned black. Im also experiencing an extreme fps drop. The game used to run fine but now it's just broken and i can't fix it by reinstalling
feel, like, game, Honestly this app is worth the money and it's a great time waster You can feel like you're conquering epic villages or defending something feel like your own personal fantasy Good game
removes, from, integration, !!! Google play integration corrupts your saves irreversibly!!! However if one removes the game from play integration the app runs perfectly. I hope this is fixed I really love this game, it fits perfectly on mobile and is a fantastic way to experience some rts flavour on the go. Neat graphics, rewarding challenge

work, on, Pixel, Doesn't work on Pixel 2. Crashes on start screen.
reset, to, percent, Great game. Loved every bit until I beat the campaign and my progress was reset to 50 percent. Tried again and same thing, meaning I was unable to unlock different perks for a new campaign.
go, past, %, Could be a great game but impossible difficulty, probably due to controls. Couldn't go past 50% of the campaign without losing commanders. And after investing all your resources into them there is no way to recover after losing them. It's impossible to coordinate defenses when attacked from multiple sides by the more advanced enemy units, it requires a degree of micromanagement that is not possible on such a small screen in real time. And you cannot issue commands while the game is paused. Shame

adds, to, effect, Gorgeous game. Graphics simple but beautiful. The music , sound effects, voice of the characters(all kinds of "hmm") really adds to the effect: brutal Viking saga. It seems people are having trouble running this game. The devs will fix this eventually..I hope. The game deserves better rating.
play, for, hours, I dont read review before i buy.. i play for hours.... exicited.. save game.. next day.. my save wont load.. so i play again from beginning.. save game.. next day again.. my save wont load again stuck on generating island.. so i play from beginning again.. and again and again and again..then i read review..

make, to, checkpoint, From the gameplay point of view, this game is flawless. Love the artstyle and strategy mechanics. However, it is extremely frustrating when you are having s good run, make it to a checkpoint and then come back a day later just to see that all your progress is gone. Very annoying bug and if fixed I would definitely give 5 stars.
found, on, mobile, This is the best RTS game I've found on mobile. Totally recommend it. The game works great on my galaxy S9.

pay, for, this, Game is great , worth the money . However it will not load my game anymore . Considering you pay for this , this type of issue shouldn't exist .
play, in, bursts, Simply fantastic, simple enough to play in short bursts, complex enough to hold your interest over multiple campaigns, and random maps keep things interesting. Hats off to any developer that takes the time to make such a high quality Android port. I initially gave a bad review since the game was deleting saves, but I am now convinced this issue is Google's fault. Just search for "google play games can't sign in" and look at all the results from the Google support forums. Should have known...

load, on, Tablet, Won't load anymore on my Samsung Tablet which isn't a crappy one. Use to work great ,but now it won't load my saved game. Please fix☹
translate, to, screen, Fun game on the PC, but doesn't translate well to a smaller screen. Units are difficult to distinguish and select, especially in the heat of battle.
deleted, for, reason, Love this polished, offline friendly game. 2 minute skirmishes and great presentation. My save file got deleted once for some reason and I'm still giving it 5 stars.
fell, in, love, Immediately fell in love with the art style. Brought it and started playing immediately. I love the game! But second time playing... Wouldn't load. Always stuck in loading bars... Reset the app, reset my phone, reset everything... Broken. The game won't load ever again :(

grabbed, on, PC, This is a fantastic and simple game! ...Well starts simple and gets increasingly difficult. I grabbed this on the PC a few months ago, this is identical! Awesome game 👍
fit, for, reason, First of all I really do enjoy this game. However for some reason it just will not fit into the samsung s10 aspect ratio. It's really frustrating. I've tried everything so I came to the realisation that the developers need to update the game for the bigger screens.

load, on, launch, I can't even get the game to load up on the first launch. It seems to have an issue with the Google Play login
does, for, eternity, I love this game, but it does not load anything anymore. When it says its generating islands it just does that for eternity.
ruin, at, points, No matter how you position your troops 90% of the time a single enemy soldier will squeeze through and damage one of your buildings and thus ruin your chance at max points, i had a full lock down of the coast against a ship with 5 enemies and my units were at max health yet it still happened, very frustrating.

occur, on, iPhone, Great game, when it lets you play! Such a fun game a with lovely style to the graphics and such smooth and quirky animation. Love it! However I've yet to complete a single campaign as after a while the game just won't load; I've been left waiting for my islands to be generated too many times. Really needs fixing, you pay a premium for no-ads indie games so it's frustrating to have these problems. I don't know if these problems occur on iPhone but it's not working properly on my Samsung.

runs, on, phone, Amazing. I'm glad that you added "restart level" option and it runs well on my phone, well optimized. UPD: -1 star because game has a random chance to corrupt your save. Will rate 5/5 again when devs fix it.
stuck, on, screen, Won't load the game just forever stuck on the loading screen so i had to uninstall
tried, on, PC, This is a great game! I first tried it on PC, and when I saw it on Android I thought "what a perfect fit". It's a form of lite RTS with hero elements, perfect for bite-sized dip-ins, with really pleasing art and interface and a nice subtle soundscape. The only minor quibble is limited replayability, but it's totally worth it even for one campaign. I encountered no stability or save issues on a Galaxy Note 10, so maybe those reported previously have been fixed?
