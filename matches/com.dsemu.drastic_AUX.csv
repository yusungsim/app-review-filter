was, emulator, good, This, This was a good emulator but since Android screwed up the ability for emulators to read SD cards in the phones this app is completely useless! Paid for an app I can't use......
is, emulator, best, This, This is the best Ds emulator i have ever used, it has high quality graphics, it runs all my ds games, and its also easy to use.

am, one, only, I, It used to be the best emulator but am I the only one with an issue with physical keyboard ? When I don't press anything the left arrow is randomly being pressed and my characters go left and I can interact.
is, emulator, smoothest, This, This is the smoothest NDS emulator on android that I've tried so far! On many devices tho such as Galaxy J1 mini, J7 prime, S6 Edge plus, S10 etc.
's, deal, bad, It, The emulator doesn't want to scan games and it won't let me open folders manually. I am using Samsung Galaxy A20s. Please solve this problem, i was playing fine almost a month ago, reinstalling doesn't fix the problem. Paying in indonesian Rupiah is worth a month of meals here, so It's a bad deal to be paying for an app that doesn't work. I'd consider changing the rating if this bug is fixed because DraStic was one of the better DS emulator next to No$.
's, emulator, good, It, It's a good emulator and does what it says. I have a major problem with the controls though. This doesn't happen with the Dpad but but the A and B keys keep getting pressed all the bloody time. No matter how big i make them/ move them around or even have it on Landscape. Can we customize the buttons fully to be able to move each one? A slight move further apart will fix this simple problem... Phone is a Samsung S8 EDIT: No longer works with android 11
's, emulator, best, It, It's the best emulator I have ever used. Gameplay is smooth, and accessing different options is quite easy.
's, app, good, It, It's a good app absolutely. But it does not work anymore after I changed to Pixel 5. The file browser has broken and is not able to browse any file.
was, emulator, good, it, Broken!....Used Drastic for a good few years and always thought it was a good emulator with nice features. Tried playing today, can't now scan phone for roms or navigate to find them. Totally useless at this point!
are, roms, good, these, $5 and the app does not recognize roms. Does not matter if they are zipped or not. Online shows to just move them to the drastic folder and you are done. Not the case, these are good roms i transferred them from my pc emulators to my phone.
is, emulator, amazing, This, This is an amazing emulator! You just download the ROM you want to play and open the app and it works! No configuration or anything. If you want to play DS games on the phone, this is the app for you.
's, deal, big, That, It runs great, haven't had a problem while playing multiple games already. Rating 3 stars because it doesn't allow me to choose games from my SD card. That's a big deal because my phone doesn't have much storage so I have to rely on my SD card for my ROMs. Edit: So I found an app that helps drastic to read ROMs from SD card. So bumping to 5 star cuz still an awesome emulator. But hope it gets an update so it's able to read from SD card. Edit: Mic don't work on games that requires it..
was, emulator, competent, what, A lack of 4x upscaling filters and botched hardware controller button mapping (switching "A" and "B" functions between in-game, overlayed emu menu and full emu menu) and an unnecessary and unremovable "fast forward" button (that is easily and often activated by users by mistake) brings down what was otherwise a competent DS emulator. 1 star until fixed.
is, place, only, that, Was the best DS emulator, but I'm now unable to see any of my games to load. Latest update didn't fix the issue with the file browser. I have a Pixel 4a 5G on Android 11. Rom files are in main directory, as that is the only place available on my phone.

's, problem, only, that, The emulation is perfect, you can use any external device by Bluetooth and filter the resolution to get an amazing graphic experience, obviously, you haven't the double screen and that's the only problem
is, emulator, first, this, BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I have a Samsung A21 which is a kinda mid to low range performance phone, but this is the first emulator I've found where pokemon platinum runs at intended FPS and doesn't crash every 90 seconds, Drastic somehow squeezed the extra performance out lol. Completely worth the money.
was, emulator, good, This, This was a good emulator until the last few days As a search for games the app crashes
's, app, halfway, it, I have a dual screen phone and I was really hoping this app would allow me to turn it into a DS with boths screens a little disapointed it's still a halfway decent app though just missing the potential that I hoped it had
's, app, decent, it, I have a dual screen phone and I was really hoping this app would allow me to turn it into a DS with boths screens a little disapointed it's still a halfway decent app though just missing the potential that I hoped it had
's, accessibility, own, it, WORKS 100% all NDS roms... smoothly fasted easy handle controlling and has an huge option menu for anything and everything needed possible to manage or arrange to it's own way/accessibility/etc..
is, notch, top, everything, I'm playing Final Fantasy Tactics A2, and I'm crashing when using thunder and hitting more than 2 targets and when the giant bird use its rushing ability and I can't continue with my quest and my progress in game, but everything else is top notch in performance.
is, emulator, own, This, This emulator is awesome! If you have a large NDS collection this is the emulator you need to have so that you can take your games on your phone. You can adjust the graphics to look better the NDS. This is a must own emulator. Worth the price.
's, space, empty, it, If the game is being played vertical, it doesn't display on the whole screen, the bottom part either has the touch buttons taking up that portion or it's just empty black space. Would be nice if the game can use up the entire screen like a actual Ds. Most ppl use a Bluetooth controller anyway, so having that option would be nice. I reached out to the developer so we'll see. Love this emulator by the way, it actually runs perfectly.

is, emulator, best, This, Pretty great emulator, no ads (as expected), runs smoothly, and so far no issues besides the usage of mic. If you don't have to use a microphone for what you want to play, then you're good to go. This emulator offers great customization/mapping for both portrait and landscape modes. It doesn't include any multiplayer options, however that should be expected for an emulator. It even offers its own cheats for some roms which can be fun to play with. This is by far the best DS emulator for Android.
's, emulator, great, It, It's a great DS emulator! Unless you are playing a game that requires the microphone, the emulator is having problems registering anything that involves the use of said microphone, Legend of Zelda: phantom hourglass has THAT one problem that does require using the mic on Eddie to try and get the salvage arm as cheap as possible which makes it impossible since it requires the microphone function. Other than that, if you plan on playing games, play the ones that DO NOT USE THE MICROPHONE FUNCTION!
's, emulator, functional, It, Overall, the quality and experience deserves 5 stars. It's a perfectly functional DS emulator for Android, without ads or any major UX issues. However, recently there's been a problem where the app will freeze if it's in the background for any reason, which means you'll lose progress whenever you accidentally open another app or go to your Overview or Home screen. It also means you have to save the game every time you back out to check a wiki.
's, app, wonderful, It, It's a wonderful app. It is the perfect application that allows you to play old games that you can no longer purchase or find in person because they're out of date or other reasons. Maybe it's just me but sometimes it glitches and crashes so when I press game A instead of playing game A game b turns on instead. A bit of technical issues but could be my phone or the file. Sometimes crashes as well and shows game glitches when too much of speed forwarding is used. Other than that a it's perfect.

's, annoyance, minor, It, Not even going to lie this is an amazing emulator. It speeds, has cheats, and the roms are very easy to process in this. This would be a 5 star app if it wasn't for one thing. Sometimes, after I save the game and leave, and when I try to load it again, it will crash a few times. It's just a minor annoyance, not anything big.
was, emulator, great, This, This was once a great emulator. Now it is just stuck on the root directory and not showing folders.
is, emulator, best, It, Used to be my favorite emulator but now cant even scan for games without a freeze and crash. Fix it and I'll bump it to 5 stars. It truly is the best Ds emulator. On ROG phone 3.

's, database, own, it, The emulator itself works great and runs most games flawlessly. There is built-in cheat support and the app comes with it's own cheat database. The only issue is with Android 11 users, the app cannot access any files on the Sd Card due to Android 11's Scoped Storage system. Hopefully a update to this app addresses this. In the meantime I have to copy over my DS games from my SD card to Internal Storage.
is, issue, know, This, Tried it but it's unable to find files on internal storage rendering it useless because I can't load any games. This is apparently a know issue since March 2020 but hasn't been fixed.
is, emulator, great, It, It is a great emulator for those who have the files needed for the games. Also those files are easy to find online if you do not currently have them.
is, emulator, only, This, This is the only ds emulator for android that works great

're, fan, ds, you, Phenomenal emulator. I haven't had any bug's, performance & graphical issues. All the games I've tried booted up without a hitch. It runs as smooth as melted butter, endless customization, graphical and performance options. Truly an amazing product! Costing only $5 ridiculously cheap! If you're a ds fan and want to bank on nostalgia or a random looking for more games you can't go wrong with this emulator. High recommendation!
's, emulator, best, it, Why it still cannot scan the file in my device?Well, until it's fixed, i will give back 5 star. Cuz it's the best ds emulator so far.
is, emulator, absolute, This, This is hands down the absolute best DS emulator I've ever tried, it's more than worth the price asked and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants an emulator for DS.

is, experience, best, this, With a Bluetooth controller added, this is the best DS emulation experience I've had, by far, even taking PC solutions into account. Only inconvenience I can think of was one out of 4 ROMHacks I downloaded keeps crashing, I personally find it really minor, and the rest of the package more than makes up for it, but it's something to keep in mind if it's important to you.
was, alternative, amazing, this, Works perfectly wanted to play pokemon black 2 without paying like 200$ on ebay this was an amazing alternative to bad ya can't traid tho but hey still fun to play it again after so long
's, emulator, good, It, It's a really good emulator, but save your progress often bc it can just crash randomly with no prior warning.
was, emulator, best, this, Done some research online before I bought and every site I checked said this was the best ds emulator and they are right. So simple to use and gameplay is flawless. Well worth the money
is, thing, only, this, best DS emulator I've tried, on my phone it works amazing but can't get it to work on my chromebook, please fix it, I sometimes use my Lenovo Chromebook duet for emulators and this is the only thing I cant get to work, the app opens and detects my ROMs but on opening a game it crashes without any error message and takes me back to the app start screen.
is, game, favorite, this, Very very nice emulator! I have a problem with ot tough. It crashes on some special effects when I'm playing Final fantasy tactics advance 2. Any help would be appreciated, this is my favorite DS game ever.
is, emulator, best, This, This is by far the best mobile DS emulator I've tried, even better than some on the PC. My phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and it runs incredibly smoothly. I've never noticed a problem with lag or crunchy music, which is a big plus because I like to play with earbuds. I was hesitant at first to spend money on an emulator, but it was absolutely worth it. I just wish that there was a way to do multiplayer.

is, emulator, best, This, This emulator has literally never let me down. I use an LG Phoenix 4 phone, so not the best chip or graphics or anything, yet every single game has run without a hitch. Not to mention all the user options! You can choose different filters and so much stuff! This is the best DS emulator on the market, definitely worth every penny.

is, emulator, best, This, This is THE best emulator you can get for DS on android 100% recommend!! Also for GBA use My boy since it's the best.
is, install, fresh, This, Current version force close when launching game. Not all games, but majority of games force close upon launch. This is fresh install, on new smartphone.
is, Emulator, best, This, Say no more! This is the best DS Emulator on Mobile!
was, app, great, this, WARNING!! As of 5/13/21, this app does NOT work with ANDROID 11 external sd card. Some changes were made with Android 11 regarding storage and this app has not been updated to work with it. A real shame because this was a great app. Really hope it gets updated. Fingers crossed. May still work with internal storage.
's, emulator, amazing, it, Pains me to put only 3 stars, it's an amazing emulator but SD Card support is broken since Android 11 — no update in a year...good luck for the fix!
's, emulator, great, It, This DS emulator is spot. I bought it out of curiosity and I saw my brother playing DS on his phone I'm like how. He told me about this emulator to be honest I'm just playing Pokemon. It's a great emulator
's, emulator, best, It, For the developer: please make possible to use external SD card so I don't have to load all games on the internal storage. After installing and trying all the other emulators on the Play Store and trying the demo version of DraStic I decided to buy it. It's absolutely the best and fastest DS emulator for Android. Would be nice if WI-Fi support was enabled and also a better management of save states, beside this it is perfect.
's, one, free, it, I paid $5 for this and it's basically the free one but crashes more. If you can refund me that'd be great.
is, emulator, best, This, This is the best DS emulator in existence. The only thing that could make it better would be incorporating achievement support through retroachievments.
is, app, great, This, This really is a great app but it is broke now they need to fix it and they need to fix it really bad I can't find any of my games I mean if it gave me the ability to look Probably would but yeah Please fix this problem I really want to start playing with this app again Please fix this problem I really want to start playing with this app again The other Ds emulators all right Probably a solid 3 stars 3.5 maybe but this app would be a complete 5 if they would just get going again
is, emulator, great, This, This is a great emulator. But you lose a star because the "eye for decay" in castlevania: portrait of ruin doesn't work due to graphical issues with this build. Please fix it.
is, emulator, best, This, This is the best emulator for DS emulation.
is, emulator, best, it, This emulator although its not free it is the best mobile emulator there is, it runs smoothly unlike all the other emulators I've tried.

is, app, amazing, this, I am in no way an expert at this stuff, but i do believe that this is an amazing app to run DS games on. I myself, have had no major problems with this app, some of my saves do get corrupted sometimes, but i figure that's because I sometimes enable cheats. Overall this is a great app!
