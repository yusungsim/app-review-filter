files, save, Edit: I now have my saves back. 5/5. This game is great if not for the fact that it now appears to regularly delete my save files. I was quite enjoying it for the first two days of playing, but then it decided not to ever save when I leave the app. As it stands I am not going to put more effort in, but if it is fixed I will happily rate 5/5.

action, little, Not bad from what I've played so far... A little RTS action for your phone or tablet
game, Super, Super polished game where you micromanage up to 4 units to defend your island against Vikings. Your units and vikings units have a class, which defines their strength and weakness (pikes, shields, bows). It is real time but with slow motion and tiles when you select a unit. It is very tactical. You jump from island to island, purchased by the Vikings (think FTL), so you need to choose and optimize your battles to gain time. And the game is beautiful ♡ 5 stars easy.

configuration, key, Please allow for manual gamepad key configuration. Currently it does not respond to my Glap Play P1. If this is done ANY controller will work. Then you don't need to support all those controllers. Please do the same to Kingdom Two Crowns. UPDATE: Controller support still broken, DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT TO USE A GAMEPAD. Customer support doesn't fix or answer!
time, spare, Just really fun, super intense and very strategy heavy, you cant just throw your units all around or else you'll get your units killed real fast. its not THAT replayable but if you have spare time this game is super good or if you need to make your brain work really hard too haha.
angle, higher, I like it, wish the camera moved to where it's viewed at a higher angle.
game, Amazing, Amazing strategy game
game, amazing, Such an amazing game I couldn't believe it. As someone who loves strategy I could never find a mobile game that satisfied that until I came across Bad North. It's simple but challenging when faced with the invaders from different directions with different attack styles. The game won't tell you everything and will only show you the basics which might be a turn off for most but for me I loved picking up on the important things. Would recommend to any strategy lover out there.

words, other, No replayability. Also quite slow. You'll finish the campaign once and probably never look back, or even remember it. Loading times are awful on Samsung S10+ . Not a game for the toilet in other words.
bit, little, I don't think I would like that this game a lot because it is very bad and you would always lose after a little bit you will die instantly after one army and you would get very frustrated and mad so with the star free star because it is very madness and and very bad

problem, same, I'm experiencing the same problem as some others, with my campaign after a while not ever getting past the "generating islands" part of the loading screen Great game But this needs fixed xcc :edit: so, that problem was fixed, but, after i progressed to around 70 something % in my first campaign, it seemed to stop revealing the next 2 connected islands in the chain? And now i cant do _anything_ in that campaign and had to start a new one unu

things, new, Very fun. You'll want more than one playthrough for sure, as there are unlockables, new things to learn each time, and multiple difficulties. Each playthrough takes between 1.5 and 3 hours with 60 + Islands and up to 40 turns. Command your squads to hold a series of islands using the topography of the islands and different weapon types. Some can be defended with 1 squad, while some need 4. Squadron commanders can be upgraded: weapon skills, special abilities and unique item upgrades.

games, favourite, Easily one of my favourite games, but I've found that my progress is never saved when closing and reloading the app? I have to start over every time. Will this be fixed?

phone, kinda, Alright a few suggestions and things about it, one it is kinda slow (granted I have a kinda sucky phone) and does take 10 seconds to load water but it's fine and perfectly playable. My suggestion to the devs is that they make a different mobile edition where you're given a random island each time rather than a full play through and you could incorporate black water in the story some how since it takes time to load in the blue. Tl;dr, suggestion for devs, andif you have the money go for it!!

job, horrible, Obviously my opinion, but this game does a horrible job of teaching you how to play and what is important to prioritize. I played for an hour and then faced the berserkers. Of course I lost all my commanders, not such a big deal I thought, will replay the level. But no, it's game over. Have to start a new save and play the exact same levels for another hour. Some people are obviously into this (a la Dark Souls) but for me it's not worth it. Otherwise great game except for the perma-death.

game, unfair, Bugged, controls are very clunky and the game does the opposite or not at all what I wanted to do. Overall an unfair game that doesn't value actual strategy

enemies, smart, Fun app. Lots of smart enemies, the difficulties scale well, and has lots of variability. However, you can't delete save files so once you've played through the game 6 times you are limited to just the save files you have

value, high, Great visuals, fun gameplay, not too high replay value for now.
dynamics, different, I really cool defense game with different dynamics. You must learn to adapt and respond using the topography of each island. Not a pay-to-win.
buggy, little, Fun idea but a little buggy. Start button doesn't work sometimes and my games never save so every time I have to restart. This game is unique and if you like strategy games give it a shot. No ads or microtransactions so rating +1 star

fix, only, Really enjoying so far. Seems I have a bug. After leaving the game it goes back to the title screen and I'm unable to press start. The quit button works fine but start does not. Tried killing all apps, and starting in airplane mode but no change. Restarting my device seems to be the only fix
game, mobile, I loved this game. It's so basic and beautiful. The music, the visuals, sound fx. It's so rare that I spend money on an mobile game and don't at some point feeling buyers remorse. Buy this game, it's great
game, awesome, It was an awesome game!
masks, different, Also different masks.Really fun game. Axe warriors that block arrows also. A 3d map maybe, like bumpy and a bigger map with several islands, mountains, desserts, forrests, rain sleet hail and snow, Maybe some horse troops.Also knights riding jerraffes, seals, lions, or other animals. Fast forward winter spring summer autumn while playing.PVP.

game, Good, Good game but doesn't save so... can't play every level in one sitting lol
game, great, Was a great game but I'm having an issue with it. All my save game data is unaccessible. It gives me an error whenever I try to load a game. So it's unplayable for now. My app icon looks like an older version of the game. Not sure if that has something to do with it.

time, first, Very good first time through.
potential, great, The game has great potential, sadly the units' AI is so lame, they can watch an enemy a block away destroying a house without doing anything, which is super annoying since it's not reasonable to micro manage units to that extent. Other than that. Could have been a five.
grabage, pure, My progress was reset to zero out of the blue. This is pure grabage.
campaign, previous, I love the game except I can't continue with the previous campaign which I last played. When I open the game the next day all my progress is gone or deleted without me knowing. I test it multiple time and the game progress is lost no matter what. I think the game got problem with auto-save.

game, amazing, amazing game, great art style and gameplay, but the game is unplayable for me (and many others) as it does not save any progress. I haven't managed to find a fix for this, and have contacted the publisher to see what they say. 5 star game, but only if it worked properly...

timings, smallest, A game where micromanagement of even the smallest timings make the difference between losing or winning a fight. The game throws new challenges at you progressively, but does tend to get a bit tedious and grindy around the higher turns. Every map is something new, every island has it's own strategies. 10/10 would buy again

depth, more, Thought the game was going to be simplistic and one dimensional, but it seems to have much more depth than meets the eye. Only gets better as you progress and allows for diverse play-styles and tactics to be utilitzed. Been having a great time with this one! Easily recommended, it's just perfect for a mobile game. The fact that it's a premium game (pay once for full access) without having a single microtransaction within it, makes me love it even more. Kudos to the devs, much appreciated.

The fact that it's a premium game (pay once for full access) without having a single microtransaction within it, makes me love it even more. Kudos to the devs, much appreciated.

babe, great, You can't save, so what's the point. It's a great babe but you can't save. You see , you can't save progress so you can't advance the progress of the game.
play, Awesome, Awesome game play and fun strategy, played through multiple times already!

squads, strong, Game is really fun but I keep losing my files so I don't think I'll be playing again. Enemies keep getting stronger but your units are a little limited. This forces you to make two strong squads instead of one super squad with good substitutes. This game also doesn't explain enemy weaknesses. This makes your first run-through extremely difficult as you learn by trial and error. So enable level restart if you are starting. Some enemies also look similar but play differently. Game lacks story.

game, Brilliant, Brilliant game that I can't recommend highly enough. Simple, but well thought out. Easy to play, but very engaging. Well worth every penny paid.
connection, valid, Defective Game. 😿 No game data is saved, and all game progress is lost after each session, despite valid connection to Google Play Games. Perhaps the game doesn't check if it has read and write permission to the device's filespace. This problem occurs on phones and tablets.
enemies, more, It kept me engaged with how difficulty increased as you kept progressing. Although the game comes short. There could be more enemies and more abilities in my opinion reason being because I've completed this game more than once.The appearance option in the beginning of the game is one of the little things I like about this game. Theres moments where you're stuck with a weak squad barely surviving against a horde of Giants. All in all great strategy game. Nice graphics and easy controls. KeepItUp

artwork, Fantastic, The game is really fun. Fantastic artwork. The only problem I keep having is that the game keeps deleting my progress. I have not actually played through the entire game because if i close the game for an extended amount of time it will delete my progress. This has happened to me every time without fail. This bug causes an extreme lack of desire to play because I know my progress will be deleted if I can't finish the game in one go. It's not a phone problem, I just got a new one. Please fix.

content, such, 10/10 game, however only ~20 hours of gameplay before it gets stale. I understand how hard it is to make a game and I appreciate the work of Raw Fury, but the price is a little too high for something with such little content, but thats just imo

campaign, first, Got my save wiped randomly at 70% of the first campaign. Design and gameplay is perfect, graphics simply beautiful, sounds are atmospheric and cute, but having all the progress and upgraded units lost is really disheartening.

game, simple, Was fun for a couple of hours but the skill tree is very limited and the levels take a lot of time. I don't think I got my money's worth. Very simple game. Simply move your units around and flank enemies with archers.
game, good, Even tried to allow app permissions and still wont save my game data. Unplayable. What a shame for such a good game.

hours, few, Been playing this game for a few hours now on the beginner / easy mode. What I like about this game is that it is easy to learn. It's very easy to pick up and start playing and overall, is an enjoyable game. However, as others have experienced, it has wiped my saved games on more than one occasion and that is very frustrating. Also, it doesn't feel so much like a strategy game as it does a reaction game, where you just move your units towards the threats as they approach.

game, Awesome, Awesome game nice graphics I love the islands shapes and sizes. but they need to add more variety of units for the good guys.I have three suggestions. Like mace men they're skill would be spinning attack which they spin in a circle across a straight line. Then spearman they're skill would be destruction which they throw they're spears and last but not least javalin men they have shields they're skill would be barrage when they throw their spears each kills three men in the boat . That is all !!

fun, much, Game is so much fun but the game does not remember the save. Must be a bug.
game, good, It is a very good game that I highly recommend to rts fans.
game, Good, Good game, bad optimizing. Overall this game is quite pleasant, it has a unique and cool artstyle, and decent gameplay, it is a wonderful strategy game and i have no complaints on the game itself (yet.) However, the optimization for mobile seems to be lacking, as the rampent game crashes made it nearly unplayable in a campaign, now this wouldnt have been that bad, but the fact that each time it crashed it would reset a portion of my campaign progress, made this a bad experience for myself.

stars, deserved, [EDITED by me in July 2021] They have fixed the save issue. My game saves regularly and automatically now and I can come back to it without having to start over. I am giving this game a well deserved five stars. I love everything about it, from the gameplay and concept to the graphics and sounds.
gameplay, exceptional, Truly exceptional gameplay, but you have to manually allow storage access to save your data, and there is no prompt to do this. I've played about 8 hours so far, but suddenly my data has gone, which is frustrating as you do unlock stuff. I've contacted the developer so we'll see how they respond. If this saving issue is resolved then the game is well worth the money! Edit: lost another star because it wiped my data again...

shame, real, Game breaking bug prevents saving progress. It's a real shame. This looks like a lot of fun and the first couple levels were great. Unfortunately it's not playable at all in its current state as you have to start over every time you close the app.

work, original, I am really upset for buying that game, it feels incomplete and with almost no tutorial or description, aside from some original artsy work that is useless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

bug, save, For those of you who say you have a save bug that is not the case, looking in my settings I found that the game does not automatically have storage as a permission which then causes it to get wiped, go to the game in your settings and allow storage as permissions , when I did this I got my old save which was 48% complete from awhile back, but I can't guarantee that you will get yours back, just that it will start saving and you can start progressing through the game

There is one thing though, there's a bug where pressing start doesn't work, nothing happens. It doss this from time to time, don't know if it's just my device... Anyway, I'll edit this review when those things happen. Worth the price.

game, amazing, It's an amazing game love it you have strategy and it's just amazing the reason why I'm giving it four stars though is because it bugged and I couldn't press the start button when I wanted to play it so I had to delete the game and get It again witch was annoying but didn't delete my progress

games, save, Fun but the save games don't persist after quiting the game. You can't really progress without the save games. Reddit users have reported this issue since 2018. Signing out of the play store does allow you to save a game. Just be sure to do it before you start a game. Clicking achievements will let you sign out.

games, free, First found this from Epic Games, as part of their "free games" program. Found it fun there, but the simplicity really lends itself best to mobile gaming. One problem I had with it: the map has a fog system that gradually unveils the islands as you progress. Now, I happen to have gotten to a sort of chokepoint in islands, and it just so happens that my path is blocked by a single unit of fog. As annoying as it is, I find it kind of hilarious. Anyhow, it's a quality timewaster.

quality, good, I love this game, the controls translate to touchscreen very well, the gameplay is simple and fun, and it's pretty good quality. This would be a 5-star review, HOWEVER, this game has a crippling save bug. It's only just started happening to me. 3 times in a row my save just gets deleted as soon as I quit the game. It doesnt matter if you leave during a battle, exit to main menu, or close the game. You lose your save file and all your time you spent on it.

game, exceptional, This is an exceptional defense game with sweet graphics and cool sound effects. I she enjoyed playing the game. Pros, graphics, sound effects, scrolling in and out, challenging, easy to play. Cons, it's hard to remember all of the saved attributes that you can gain during the game including the bonuses to your commanders. It takes a while to play and get good at it but it is enjoyable. I don't think it's nearly as good as polytopia, but still replayable.

Cons, it's hard to remember all of the saved attributes that you can gain during the game including the bonuses to your commanders. It takes a while to play and get good at it but it is enjoyable. I don't think it's nearly as good as polytopia, but still replayable.

variation, much, The game is nice. The graphics are nice. The map is limited. And there is not much variation. Sure, the maps are auto generated, but after a few days it will become obvious this is more of the same.

feature, quick, Love this game. Very beautiful and simple. Well worth it. Only suggestion, can there be a quick play feature, so just a random map generator with a choice of different levels. So we dont have to always play the carrer through each time, But a choice for quick random map games. Thanks.

game, Amazing, Amazing game. Loved it. Please do a sequel
months, few, Edit review. Previously gave 1 star just due the game crashing and not loading. Was literally unplayable. Downloaded again after few months and works fine now. Game is a delight with fun mechanics, graphics and music. Great game to play when I'm meant to be working. Back to 5 stars.

game, great, I really love this game and its challenges you to do things outside of the box and all around a great game except for the lag every once in a whil
game, Best, Best game ever
issues, save, You SERIOUSLY need to fix the save issues. I have lost 50% on 2 different files. Might have something to do with starting offline, but that needs fixed. I am 57% in and clouds block my way. I can't get through.

game, good, It's a good defence game! So far it's basically a challenge and so good for a pc game.
game, Simple, Simple and straightforward strategy game at its best. No p2w or base building energy timers. One of my favorites ❤
achievements, various, Doesn't save progress, played for around 3 hours, got various achievements on Google play, returned a couple days later to find all on game progress was gone, nothing in codex, no save slots, happens every single time. Waste of time until that's fixed.

units, more, My save game appears to have been deleted? I had reached a checkpoint and restarted from it and now my game is gone? Otherwise the game is pretty good. Could use more units for the player to strategically use.
creation, amazing, 😀amazing that the devs turned this amazing steam creation into a mobile game

game, Great, Great game! Would definitely recommend. Genuinely surprised there are still cell phone games worth playing! Best cell game I've played in quite some time.Thanks! As mentioned in another player's review, the only addition I can think of is after game completion having the option to replay from the beginning using your endgame upgraded troops.

juegos, existen, La verdad me esperaba mayor cosa, al cabo de un par de horas ya es aburrido por lo repetitivo. No lo recomiendo, existen mejores juegos.
micro, adorable, I absolutely loved this game. It's an adorable and fairly challenging micro-RTS game that's well worth your money. Tons of customization and nuances. It works so well on my Galaxy Note 10 with the stylus. My only issue is that my 8bitdo n30 pro 2 controller does not work for this game at all even if controller support is available. I won't knock points off it just because it's a very fun game. Please fix the controller issue 😁

games, few, This game was well made! Supper fun. One of the few mobile games I finished completely. They nailed the mechanics and controls of the game. Also loved the one time purchase.

game, simple, Very simple game took awhile to finish but it's to easy. If you need a tip then get 2 pike units and 1 shield one archers are totally useless.
game, awesome, awesome game!
options, multiple, The game took me about 5 hours to finish, which felt about right for this game. The game makes you think and be tactical to make your troops effective and keep them safe. There are multiple difficulty options so it should be too easy/hard for most people. My only suggestion to the devs would be to perhaps have the availability to play through the game again with your upgraded troops at a harder difficulty. Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was the best mobile game I've played in about a year.

upgrades, more, Worth every penny, I do wish there were more character upgrades as it does get repetitive rather quickly with only 3 units. The pikeman doesn't even seem worth using to me at all as the swordsman just has better damage and defense, and although archers are good enough i end up just using swordsman constantly. Not sure what all the technical issues people are complaining about are, as I haven't personally had any problems besides a lack of variety to keep things from getting old. Overall great.

game, Excellent, Excellent game that translates to mobile quite well. Very pleased overall. Just wish it ran on my tablet!
warfare, medieval, Been watching the Last Kingdom on Netflix and became Addicted to medieval warfare. This game is perfect for Vikings and Knights matches and very addictive and yet not too complex. Perfect find!

bit, little, I love the game i lobe the grafics style i love the fighting i love the upgrades but thr should make it to where you can change some ones role but its ok if you dont cuz i can livr with out its a you can press start its just that you have to wait a little bit the screen will get a little brighter when you can press start but only problem is it takr long to load.
upgrades, Decent, Fun game. Decent upgrades, but not very diverse. Not overly difficult for the sake of balance. Several times I switched apps and when I came back to the game it didn't resume from where I left off. Then when I finally made it to a checkpoint and later returned to the game, it keeps failing to load the game.

bug, frustrating, Fun game but as others have said it has a frustrating bug that freezes and won't let you go past start. Even a phone restart won't fix it. Hopefully the developer does something.
learning, easy, I really enjoyed playing the game. I wanted to get the app when it was first available. The game play is straightforward, easy learning curve.

game, Great, Great game...when it works. I can usually play once every time I restart my phone. After that, the start button won't work but the exit button will. Fix that and this will be a 5 star.

spikes, lag, I love this game! It is amazing. There are some lag spikes and such but it's a mobile game. The only thing in my opinion would be cross platform multiplayer. Say... Each player gets 2 commanders?

game, Great, Great game but borderline unplayable due to a couple of big bugs, the first being that sometimes the game wont even allow me to press the start button upon loading the game. The second bug being that the game doesnt save my progress properly. 2 stars until those bugs are fixed, then I'd be happy to make it a 5 star game.

progress, Saving, Saving progress never worked. Have to restart each time. Going through the beginning levels growing armies becomes tedious. After a few levels, the only challenge is the clunky controls.

strategy, more, It's alot of fun, pretty much a tower defense but with more strategy. I see people are having save issues where their save files aren't there or the game isn't saving. I'd recommend not hitting the return to menu button, instead, when you're done playing just hit the home button on your phone and close it that way. When you come back to the game your save should be there. If you die or lose you have to start over. My saves are always there and I can always pick up where i left off.

rating, lower, 02/21 Edit: I wish I could give a lower rating. Emailed contact to report the save game bug, and got no response for several weeks after many follow-ups. Does anyone actually work there? Save files broken. As others have commented, there is a common but that renders your saves and the whole game unplayable. Reconsider paying for this game until a fix is released.

games, fun, One of the most fun games I have played in a long time. I am very picky with what I download, and even more picky with what I will pay for. This is worth every penny and just great all around. Love the gameplay, the art, the strategy. Such a good game!

dlc, new, This game has so much more potential than what is currently here, yet the devs don't seem to be aware of that. It needs bug fixes and some new content(even paid dlc would be good) because at the moment the best things about Bad North are the atmosphere and soundtrack. This is meant to be a game not a movie so see to it.

types, More, More charcter types pls maby a catapult that can shoot boats down as they come in but moves and reloads slow and is bad at hand to hand combat. It needs at least something new if a game isnt updated it simply becomes boring.

phases, first, I'm really disappointed that this games experience is awsome but it's full of bugs and crashes specially freezes, the game lags even though the phone is capable of running it.. the first phases seems fine but while in progression the game became sluggish or laggy.. it's unplayable.. FIX THIS DEV DONT LET THIS GAME DIE ITS A MASTERPIECE!! Or else.. i will do some drastic measures to refund my money or worst..

game, Great, Great strategy game, you have to change your positions on the spot and make last second decisions or else you lose. It's very cool and the trait system is especially unique.

guys, Nice, Nice job guys!
attempt, Nice, Nice attempt at what could be a fun game, but it just CANNOT save your games correctly. I've yet to get very far at all because of bugs and glitches with my games. Once it loaded me at the correct place, but it took all my upgrades away, so I was dead in the water. Other times it just crashed my file and deleted it. Another I reached a check point, died, attempted to reload at the check point I reached, but it took me back to the previous point so I lost all of my progress. Terrible.

lot, whole, I love this game but I'm very frustrated with it at the moment, because all of a sudden I can't log in to the game. I am stuck at the screen that has the title and the start button and it won't allow me to press the start button, or more rather, it doesn't do anything when I push the start button, I will give this five stars whenever I am able to actually log in. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and the whole lot so if it could be fixed, I would be more than happy to give a good review.

thing, whole, Doesn't actually save your game between sessions, so unless you want to play through the whole thing in one sitting, avoid.
game, good, It's a good game

But The PROBLEM is it loads too long, it takes like 10 to 20 Minutes But thats just me you guys decide if you solve those problems sooooo yeah this is my rating

game, new, It NEEDS replay value, if I complete the campaign the end should some stacking bonus for the new game. It's hard (but ez). I like the unit animations, to me that react to environmental happenings like real warriors would. The special abilities were meh and hard to execute (in 4 campaigns I'm yet to really nail a plunging attacking). I'd like to see this game with some pay to win purchasables and a REWARD for getting to the end

save, last, I cant load last save. Please fix it.
scissors, simple, Bad North has no right to be as good as it is. The developers deserve your money, and if you play it, you will know why. The strategy this game has takes a simple rock paper scissors premise of combat to another level, literally! Worth every penny!
take, interesting, An interesting take on unit squad-style RTS games with nice graphics. I think I would enjoy it more on a tablet as it feels a bit tiny on a phone screen.

bug, unfortunate, Have hit an unfortunate bug that effectively renders the game unplayable, which is unfortunate given it is otherwise a very fun game. Gets stuck in an endless loading screen (while the game is "generating islands") for saved games of difficulty "normal" or higher. A quick search reveals this is a very common bug. Will be seeking a refund.

couple, first, Sort of slow, but fun. The first couple of menus may take a while to load...a long while, but once you're in, the game runs fine. If not faster loading times, some sort of indicator would be nice. Please fix Two Crowns...sluggish...really want to play.

bugs, many, Waste of money. Too many bugs, random degrees of difficulty, building troops takes way too long and if you loose one battle thats pretty much game over.

concept, Great, Definitely not worth $5. Great concept and enjoyable game play (for the most part). Though it gets rather frustrating in later levels that feel more luck based than actual skill based. This is even more apparent when the enemies are all stronger than your mostly maxed troops on top if the enemies getting access to stupidly powerful troop types that you don't get. But if you can get while it's on sale than I'd say get it.

game, addictive, This is an addictive game. The graphic is simple, yet attractive. I only complain the campaign system, which can delete our progress after there ia no turn. Seriously, after upgrading the commanders?
game, good, Very good game, but would be better if it had more than 3 classes.
game, Simple, Simple fun strategy game. I just wish there was more.
masterpiece, absolute, An absolute masterpiece for mobile.
experience, great, A great experience because the game is so good but I wish I was free
graphics, Beautiful, Beautiful graphics and elegantly minimal mechanics, but microing your units precisely enough to be effective is frustrating. Overall this game was good but not great value.

downside, only, Its really simple and good but the only downside is that it takes sooooooooooooooooo long to load. Please fix this. I literally had to wait 40 minutes for it to load up into my campaign. I really love the commander part of the game.The grunts they make when you press them. The upgrades feel satisfying. Its very well made. Just do fix the loading problem.
progress, earned, Love the game but the checkpoints don't work- I lose my hard earned progress. Any update is required
game, fun, Very fun strategy game
game, Good, Good game
games, saved, Loved it at first, but can't load saved games - getting stuck at the loading screen like everyone else.
error, first, The first error: not reloading what I play offline and online, thinking that when I play offline everything is saved. When I re-enter online, it did not save. The second error: crashes when entering the game, unable to press play. Advise everyone to read reviews and should not spend money to buy junk games like this.

game, great, Great at First Starts off amazing, it really is a great game. However once you get deeper in the game the giant archers show up and really ruin the game. Most units have a counter however these units don't making them pretty game breaking. They have ridiculous range, high damage, and knockback. Something that might help is to balance that unit or at least add a feature that allows comat to slow (like it does when a unit is selected)or can be pause so you can see whats going on and how to react

Of course this issue doesn't stop the devs from charging you $5 for the privilege of downloading the app. Would be nice to get some premium bug fixes for the premium price. Edit: after a quick Google search, it appears this issue isn't exclusive to mobile. It's happening on PC and Switch platforms also. Yikes.

fun, much, Great Game so much fun
challenges, more, I love this game but I hope there is more to it. Add more challenges like invading islands too.
time, worst, It pauses in the worst time ever
modes, eofferent, Would be a 5. Its smooth, balanced, simple. But there needs to be eofferent game modes, and a store maybe, log in reward, and more classes.

game, fun, Really fun game, possibly my favourite on mobile. Easy to pass a lot of time with, especially recommend on long flights/journeys!

game, nice, It's a nice game. Doesn't develop so much. Upgrades in the game are pricey and money hard to earn. The game itself is quite challenging. It's ok. A good game.

graphics, potential, I regret buying this game. $5 is too much for a game that is so frustrating at times. It has A LOT of potential, great graphics and gameplay, but difficulty scales exponentially. The final map has been impossible to beat in my experience. Codex has no information about how skills, items or traits actually work. There is no info whatsoever about the enemies, the fact that Brutes are so f** powerful, and show up out of nowhere, make it impossible to prepare. Some combo of enemies are just stupid.

game, Great, Great game, until it stops loading. I've been going strong, getting the hang of the simple, but nuanced, gameplay. 👍 Until it just keeps spinning when I try to reload my game. I tried clearing the app cache as some others have noted, but to no avail. Major bummer 👎

game, basic, A bit pricy for what is a very basic and repetitive game with no real story. Just endlessly expand and defend islands by positioning various units around small maps. Very easy to pick up, very simple mechanics. It's a good game.

thing, only, The only thing I can do is close the app. It will do nothing else after loading.
game, actual, This is an actual good game. It is a good strategy game that is a lot of fun. My only wish is that they add more to it. Maybe even let the player be the raiders in a different mode. It's still a lot of fun. I mainly enjoyed it cause i don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on it to win and no ads. If you hate this game than your bad at adjusting to different foes. I really like the late game when it gets more challenging. And again if any creators see this. Please add more. It ended so fast.

game, good, make u you want to throw your phone away at times. All in all a pretty good game
game, Amazing, Amazing game! Very easy to pick up. I thought it was simplistic at first but there is a lot of nuance to it. Units utilize a sort of rock/paper/scissors power structure (shields defeat archers, archers defeat swordsmen, pikes defeat shields, etc). There are also cool downs for different units and upgrades to make them stronger. Overall a well constructed fun game with awesome graphics.

game, late, Very good until late game, when it becomes extremely frustrating. Partly because it was so good earlier, you expect it to keep being that. But once the big vikings show up, it stops making any sense: your guys just get going about all over the place and you have to react very fast, but it's so easy to select the wrong group. I found many of the late battles almost random - just repeat several times until you get through, without it being exactly clear why. It's a different, frustrating game.

islands, generating, Regarding the "generating islands" bug: I got it as well from time to time but simple deleting the cache will make it work again! That's why i also only give 4 stars, it is pretty annoying when it happens but can easily be fixed. The game itself is great though! Works very well on mobile (I've played it before on PC)

game, good, It's a good game, but like others, it tends to get stuck on the loading screen.
game, really, This is a really, really fun strategy game. I love the way it simplifies the RTS-style game play so it is more accessible for mobile. The only problem I have encountered is the extremely high battery consumption (a little over 20% per hour). If they can fix that with a low power setting this will be very worthy of five stars!

bugs, same, Really love the game - it's both casual but interesting enough to feel invested. Have reduced a star because I am getting the same bugs as others, is getting stuck on the loading screen when trying to load a game for instance which is frustrating. But when you can actually get into the game it's fantastic!
islands, stuck, Fix your game devs! DO NOT BUY THIS. The game is totally broken and they haven't replied to the email I sent for a refund. Google really shouldn't be allowing this game in the Play Store in this state. The game doesn't save, it doesn't keep unlocks and it gets stuck generating islands. Great gameplay let down by being a totally broken game. It's a complete scam that this has been a problem from launch, it's not been fixed and the devs do not reply. The 5* reviews surely cannot be real.

game, awesome, Really awesome rogue-like + RTS game, but not one you have to love RTS's to get into. Feels and looks really great and the mechanics feel very well thought out. Also a lot of replay value. It's one I find myself leaving for a bit and then coming back to again again. Matches are reasonably short too, so good game for on the go. Personally I think it's one of the best mobile rogue-likes around.

gameplay, flashy, This game shows how you don't need flashy gameplay, complicated mechanics, or high-end graphics to make a fun and entertaining games. I recommend you get it. The five dollars are worth it. Just warning you all though. This game tends to slow down by the end of the game and this is only made worse if you have multiple save files(in my case I only had two). If you delete most of your save files and keep one, your game will speed up significantly.

mechanics, developed, Really well developed game mechanics, immersive music, and graphics. Doesn't take long to figure out the basics. Over time new strategic nuances come to light. I am hooked. Worth the investment.

fit, perfect, Excellent streamlined RTS. I first discovered this gen on Xbox Game Pass, and I had to buy the mobile edition because it's such a perfect fit.
game, Excellent, Excellent game, was worth the $5. The gameplay, skill unlocks, and upgrade economy all work well together. This would be a 5 star game, except it's now stuck in the "generating islands" load screen.

game, fun, Seemed like a fun game, but after a dozen or so islands the app will not load past generating islands.
bugs, annoying, I just finished the game on easy and dispite some annoying bugs, I have to say this was a beautifully crafted strategy game that does not disappoint. Well worth the price. I'm definitely playing through again on all the difficulty settings.

elements, roguelike, This is a really good RTS if you are more into puzzles than stressful RTS. There are some roguelike elements as well, but you can turn them off if you like. But the game itself is really good, the way you need to match troops against certain foes, and also positioning them correctly. And as you progress in the game, that becomes more and more important and more difficult to pull off.

islands, generating, Yeeeeah seriously guys, I LOVE the game, but even if I just switch from this app to another for a minute or so, game reloads when I pull it back up, aaaaaaand u go to load ur save(was 2hrs into campaign), and as others have said, at the "generating islands" part, NOTHING HAPPENS, music even fades out I noticed...... (UPDATED REVIEW), Weeellllllll, seems they fixed the problem, at least I didn't have it any more, so when WORKING, great game(If a short??)
game, Great, Great game, but like some of the other reviews, it gets stuck on the "generating islands" screen. Once you have played for the first time, exited out of the app, and try to go back and play again, the app won't let you. So I would give this app a five star review, but because of this problem I can't play it.

cases, many, After 3-4 retries it becomes frustrating. Starting from a checkpoint does not let you advance in the game if your situation is not good enough, so they are useless in many cases. Good and addictive game anyway.

thing, damn, I love the game on PC so I bought it here. I can't see a damn thing because of the camera. Let me be able to zoom farther in to view troops. (I have a Pixel XL 2.) It'd also be nice if there were additional options for controlling units like removing the need to tap time on a square to move.

blend, good, A good blend of RTS and Roguelike. Also, a nice take on FTL-like games. I hope there would be more updates in the future. Suggestions: 1. Bigger maps with more deployable units. 2. New units: - Engineer (uses crossbow with longer cooldown than archer / active ability builds barricades) 3. New Enemies: - Goliath (single siege-type unit / high HP / slow ) 4. Revision of Swordman skill to Shield Wall from Jump Attack (I rarely use the Jump Attack) 5. A mode where you can be the Vikings instead.

cooldown, longer, A good blend of RTS and Roguelike. Also, a nice take on FTL-like games. I hope there would be more updates in the future. Suggestions: 1. Bigger maps with more deployable units. 2.

games, mobile, I am one to find mobile games tedious. This game is the best mobile game I ever played. A very simple strategy game with rpg or rogue like elements. It's this that makes it so good and progressively enjoyable as you upgrade your troops. Graphics are perfect. I give this 4.5 stars. The game runs perfect for me except one time I could not load a save which i think is a problem for some but I wasn't bothered much. I wish this game was longer, more enemies and different units.

game, Great, Great game when it works, but currently disappointing and not worth paying money for the experience. As of right now, I get stuck on the start screen and I can't get past it, even if I press start. This happens whether I have wifi connection, or no internet connection at all. Sounds like other people have had similar issues about getting stuck in certain screens as well. Gameplay is great, but haven't been able to play since I shelled out money for it.

devices, other, I really like this app but it won't let me get past the start page. It won't let me press start and all it does is play the music and let me click on the cross which lets you quit. It is strange because this doesn't happen on any other devices 🤷🏼‍♀️ but they are on a different account so I don't know.

game, fun, Very fun game! Quick to pick up and we'll put together.
mix, incredible, An incredible mix of realtime strategy in a rogue like environment. The gameplay is simple but its mechanics make it deep enough. The mobile port is perfect for this game. The difficulties are well balanced and they give a fair level of challenge to the player. Graphics and art look simple at first, but the details make this game unique and enjoyable. Appreciated the option to set the game to run at 60fps (default 30fps) that gives an even more smooth experience thanks to great animations.

game, amazing, Beautiful...but needs a fix. 79% done and I can't resume from my save. Stuck on loading screen. Devs don't seem to be involved with support, as I have tried emailing them with no avail. Wish I can finish this amazing game someday!
variants, more, Love it but can there be more unit variants or an expansion pack to different regions or even a way to have advance unit commands
regions, different, Love it but can there be more unit variants or an expansion pack to different regions or even a way to have advance unit commands
menu, main, The game infinitely loads my save file. Also, sometimes I can't access to main menu because "start" button doesn't work.
game, Fantastic, Fantastic game. Worth the money
screen, endless, Love the game when it works, menu screen start wont press at times leaving it unplayable. Loading islands will get a endless loading screen. But its a toss up if itll work or not. Disapointed plz fix will give 5 stars, This is a lg stylo 4 phone

fan, huge, I'm a huge Total War fan and I was skeptical at first from looking at it but this is a phenomenal game that stands out on its own and has really fun strategy aspects unlike most other games out there.

game, good, Really good game if you have a good phone to run it. because the generating islands part does take a while even with my octa core processor. Decent replayability. Strangely anti climatic ending.. just my oppinion. I wish there was a bit more content for its price. But the music and artstyle does make up for that.

changes, fundamental, So the game play is good but I think some fundamental changes are required. You collect armies as you go, but when you deploy you don't get an option to choose which armies can be deployed, which doesn't make any sense. It can't always be all or nothing. You should be able to go back in the map, if army is fatigued then there should be a time after which point they are fully recovered. Lots of options are binary. Need to fix those
game, saved, The game won't keep and load a saved game if you close/reopen the app. Very frustrating. Fun game, but can't progress very far if I have to start again every time!
issues, same, The game is brilliant, really fun and great for on the go play. I am having the same issues as everyone else; past a certain point it doesn't seem to load my save game and is stuck on 'generating islands'. Tragic as the game gets more interesting the longer you play. Annoying as it's a paid for game.

devices, different, Stuck on Campaign 2 27% Normal, the game won't load, I've tried on two different devices now...
load, Unable, Unable de load parts....
game, bad, It's not a bad game but it gets quite repetitive. Also I get it that it's a game and a fictionalised universe, but I thought we moved on from the (mis)representation of Vikings as bloodthirsty brutes.

brutes, bloodthirsty, It's not a bad game but it gets quite repetitive. Also I get it that it's a game and a fictionalised universe, but I thought we moved on from the (mis)representation of Vikings as bloodthirsty brutes.
downside, only, This game is really fun to play, the more you play the more it gets difficult which is kind of nice. The only downside is how fast it wastes your battery life but that's okay.
times, few, Wow. I absolutely love this game. It's definitely difficult, make sure to hold onto your coins and save the trinkets for until you've figured out your groove. I highly recommend using the ring (increases clan size by 16) for an Archer. That saved my butt a few times. Beautiful and very well made.
gameplay, core, This game seems deceptively simple at first, but its actually very deep and dynamic. The core gameplay is better than most PC rts, the art and music is beautiful, it has to be one of the best mobile games in existence

games, best, One of the best games I have ever played on a mobial device yet like many people I am experiencing the same issues as other where it gets stuck on generating islands when loading up the game, this prevents you from ever getting to the endgame without playing it all in one sitting, the most disappointing thing is the dev's have not even responded to other comments saying they are trying to fix it, dev's own up to your mistake and fix it so we can all enjoy this wonderful game again.

game, balanced, Had a blast playing through on medium and then hard without restarts, very well balanced charming game, hard was challenging without being too ridiculous. Very hard, however is just really cheap and infuriating, got to turn 6-7 thinking it was challenging but still enjoyable, after that it's just silly. Veteran archers whittled down to 2 men from high ground by 6 enemy archers Veteran spearmen overrun through a choke point by basic militia.... Not carrying on to see how stupid the rest will be.

game, great, It doesn't save! This problem has apparently been going on for almost a year. Fix this problem! It is a great game but very frustrating! Edit: Just did a new campaign to see if it saves. When I exit and come back in, I have to start a new campaign??? What a shame

game, Great, Great game! Fun strategy that requires you to think and understand the behavior of the units and come up with strategy. Bugs: It's now almost impossible to play, as nearly every click opens up the menu. I'll go back to 5 stars when the game works. Update: Sometimes clicks in games will get miss mapped, going to odd locations on the map, often the menu. Update 2: Added to this, now the game won't start. Update 3: after reinstall, game still won't start, it gets stuck on "generating islands"

games, best, This is one of the best strategy games I've found. The gameplay is enjoyable, the art is fantastic, if you screw up, your game is basically over... Like you have to restart... decisions are critical, you pay dearly for screw ups, though it's not so bad that by other good decisions you can't recover. There is a ton of variety, so you can play through again with completely different results. It's awesome, more than worth the price.

games, best, One of the best games on the Play Store - not very expensive either? Easy to pick up, this beautiful indie game is very well done. Shows the sort of games phones can support - and way better than any of those crappy games you see on ads on YouTube! I highly recommend it if you like RTS strategy games. All I would've liked extra was a bit more content - maybe more types of unit, and maybe add fortifiable buildings in some maps? Would make the endgame of each campaign more interesting!

review, higher, Would have left a higher review because the game is loads of fun, but after you're about 40% through you can't load the game if you're coming back. It does load a save if you don't have much progress. But the real issue I have is no developer feed back on many of the other comments with the same issue.

issues, technical, The game is pretty fun itself. But there is a lot of technical issues. And you would expect a paid game to be complete. I see on comments everyone is having technical issues. Mine is i can play a new game no problem, but when i try to load a saved game it gets stuck on generating world loading screen...

game, Excellent, Excellent game, nice design, mechincs and graphics. Looks very simple but actually forces you to think and plan during not only the action but during the sailing. 5/5. Would highly recommend.

island, generating, This game is awesome! Up to the point you come back to load your game and that the loading screen is stuck on "generating island". So every time you succed to go far in the game, you have to restart from the very beginning. So you can't ever finish the game because of that stupid bug. I would rate it 5 star if I could finish the game.

game, finished, Price is too high for a half finished app/game. "Generating islands" is a buggy (stucks at screen). Furthermore, the Google screen overlay should be displayed every time the app is started. At least I don't see the point in doing that.

hours, few, Great to play... Until it stopped working. Played this game for a total of a few hours... Now it will not load. Gets stuck on building the islands. Waited 10+ minutes, I've uninstalled and installed again. Sent email to developer a month ago, and no response. No recent updates to the app. Even trying a new campaign let me play a bit, and now does the same thing. Would love to play this game more, and rate it higher, but if I can't play it, it won't get more than 2 stars.

needs, many, I love this game. It's an RTS (realt time strategy) that has many strategy needs and wants that help. I love it. I'd recommend anyone this game if you like RTS fighting games.
game, Excellent, Excellent game. Already a fan of the desktop version.
concept, neat, I made the mistake of not looking at the gameplay before making my purchase. I was under the impression you were the vikings. It's still a neat concept. However a version where you play the Vikings landing on European islands would be awesome.

time, simple, This game has no right to be asking for over 5 dollars for what amounts to be a simple time waster with no depth. Worth 99 cents tops.

time, long, Really want to give this 4 or maybe 5, but it's too buggy. It can take a long time for the game to become responsive when starting up again, I've waited several minutes for it to generate maps and let me play again, to no avail. Edit, I'm a recent player, the game has been updated, but the bugs remain. Starting to wonder if positive reviews are for other platforms or paid.

involvement, little, Average- i love strategy games, this is good initially but really really repetitive with little involvement. If you want a strategy game to involve you, Rome total war is your game.

game, perfect, I own this on both PC and Xbox, and still prefer it on my phone, it is perfect for the medium and great to play on the go. There's never been a game more perfect for a port.
completion, first, Can't praise this game highly enough. Coming off the back of my first completion (medium difficult) absolutely buzzing because I won with 5 troops left. Controls are perfect, AI is mind-blowing, customisation of army is spot on, graphics are clean, it's a real challenge (I haven't even tried hard yet) but very rewarding, no in-app purchases or adverts - which ironically makes me want to throw money at the devs. 10/10, also made in Unity which is the dankest game engine.

game, Great, Great game! Super fun. Are you planning to add a new class? Like maybe a heavy shield class or something? Just curious. Also would multiplayer be available soon? Like regular campaign except 1 person controls 1 squad and the other person controls the 2nd squad. If so multiplayer should be a lot harder due to more available friendly squads and traits. So it would make sense to make it much harder but keep the same campaign format. Other then those questions amazing and fun game!

data, saved, This game should be higher than a 4.0 rating because it is absolutely fantastic. People rate it poorly not because the gameplay is terrible. They've just been unfortunate of having issues with the game loading or their saved data going corrupt, but not me. The game is phenomenally addicting and yet challenging. It's never the same, so you'll have new and fun challenges to experience. Money well spent.

They've just been unfortunate of having issues with the game loading or their saved data going corrupt, but not me. The game is phenomenally addicting and yet challenging. It's never the same, so you'll have new and fun challenges to experience. Money well spent.
wich, amazing, This is an amazing game wich there is none other like. But I would say that they should ad were if you hold in the unit (pikemen and swordsmen)where you can do formations such as the phalanx. And should add more modes for example. A creative mode where you can make your own island or defend agaisnt zombies or where you are the Vikings and you attack. They should also add PvP wich would be so fun. Anyway it's a good game and its worth the five bucks. Good luck

battles, short, I love this game. Scaled down rts with short battles so you can just do one game and drop it. Sadly it suffers from the same problem other rts do, namely that you give an order and the units dont do it well. Here, for example, everytime I tell a commander to flee he still fights with anyone around him, sometimes going out of his way and costing his life. Why? Also, the game recognizes when I connect/disconnect a controller, yet none of the buttons work and it doesn't allow me to map buttons.

strategy, mobile, One of the more polished and engaging mobile/strategy games I've ever came across. I just only wish there was more content after completing the campaign, another mode perhaps? Endless mode or survival would be what this game needs. But for what it is I can't complain!

games, best, One of the best games to pay for on the whole Play Store! Great graphics and gameplay. You can play the game over and over again and the games difficulty isn't easy which make you concentrate on the gameplay. Strategy is key here.

game, great, A great little game with lovely graphics and pitch perfect level of difficulty, treading the line well between being too punishing and too easy. I'd easily give the game 4 or even 5 stars but I've just encountered the save file bug that means I've just lost my progress about halfway through the campaign. For me, the loading screen gets stuck whilst "generating islands". Looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this issue and it's a shame as it's a blight on an otherwise we'll made game.

problem, only, The game was fun and tactical. The only problem i face now is i can't load as usual, stuck at loading island graphics. Don't know why, right now it's so hard to play again the campaign.
weapon, ranged, Love the game but can you add in a crossbow unit(archers with a long ranged weapon and can be in melee) raider unit(uses a 2 handed battle axe and looks like a viking but has alot of health and only has a squad of 4) and a calvary unit which is infantry on horseback or halberders(which are heavy armoured infantry with a shield and a halbed)

pace, good, I really enjoyed this game. Looks great, sounds great, plays really well, and the replayability is high. It has a good learning curve pace too, although imho you could spread out the difficulty of the last two islands across the last four or five, as the last two islands really were a big jump up in terms of difficulty and ai strategy. Overall, well done!

Only suggestion would be if you could switch sides and be the bad guys aswel and if you could unlock the ability to use your entire army not just 4 teams per turn.

game, thought, It is a very well thought out game. I'm still enjoying the gameplay as well. However I don't know if it is my personal account that is linked with the game or the game itself but it doesn't save my progress. Everytime I go back on to the game I have to create my lords and start again.

games, strategic, I love strategic games like this, the graphic itself is good, easy to play and understand what is this game is all about. The controls are good too but one thing. Sometimes when I open the game in the front screen, the start button can't click or what, mostly it can't be click the "START" button. Please fix this because I like the game itself and lastly I paid for it.

color, correct, The graphic has problem. When the island starts, the sea is all black, need to zoom in and out to reset it to the correct color. When rotate the island, a black shadow of the shape of the island will be left in the sea, also need to zoom in and out to reset it back to normal. The gameplay is great though, would've been 5 stars if no graphic issues.

game, wonderful, What a wonderful game! The controls are fluid and intuitive, the graphics easy to see and the game play is simple yet deep. I definitely felt like I got my money's worth and will play this game until it gets old. One of the best premium games I have ever played, and I will definitely recommend it to any fan of the genre.

game, whole, I'm pretty angry right now. The game was fun and I started putting some hours into it but I accidentally deployed my commanders and realized I sent too many, so I clicked flee island to restart it. It just ****ing ended my whole game and all those hours were wasted. Stuppppiiiiid mechanic. Make sure you give warnings. Not sure if I'll try again. Ffs.
game, excellent, Unfortunately despite being an excellent game... it does not have a proper save game function. Whenever I come put of the game there is no autosave or save function. As a result you lose all progress. Very frustrating. Its like playing mega drive games again unable to end the session and worried about the thing overheating...

comments, negative, I feel there is a lot of negative comments that WERE justified with an older version back in the day, but I enjoyed a stable game without a single issue. Is this game worth $5, yes. You'll probably get 4 hours play time out of it as once played through it lacks depth or breadth for replayability. What is it lacking for 5 stars? additional game play, quests and one additional class like a long Bowman. Otherwise, worth the spend and 4 stars.

gripe, small, The art and everything is amazing. Though i only have a small gripe with the app and that is the inability to fill my screen. Hehe please do fix this, i want to play the game without worrying about speeding up the screen burnin issue in oleds
future, near, I've contacted developers regarding refunding their app that I've purchased in the less than 3 hours before. They flatout refuse to refund me. They have been reported to the Play Store team. I'm hoping that this issue gets resolved in the near future.
game, Brilliant, Brilliant game.
job, great, I love this game and the developers have done a great job with it. My only issue with the game in any sense is the infinite loading issue. It needs to be fixed immediately. Apart from that, this game is worth the money

units, more, The game is very fun and a game of unit rock, paper and sciccers with the invaders. However I wish there were more units and if not types of sub units within a class. However don't let that stop you from playing this amazing game.

classes, more, The game is quite enjoyable in regards to gameplay. I could do for a few more classes or perhaps a deeper skill tree in what we already have. Aside from that it is worth the $5.00. My main concern and reasoning behind the 2 star is the game breaking bug that seems to have been around for a while now. Enjoyed this game until I found out my saved games will not load when coming back to play them later. All progress lost. It's totally unacceptable and I ask that something is finally done about it.

game, stunning, It is a stunning game to look at. The gameplay is smooth and although not easy to master it makes it all the more fun to master. The game itself revs up quickly so the simplicity of it makes it all the more interesting the further you go. The replayability is high, and as such is recommended for any would be general.

menu, main, I really love this game and I am already addicted to it but can you guys use the checkpoints for us to load there so we wont lose our progress because I spent a hour playing and I thought of going to main menu to look at the Codex and continue it later but it made start a new one. Please add load files and save its really enjoyable but its tiring to keep losing your progress. Please add this ASAP.

game, good, This game is a lot fun. I've been looking for a good strategy game on the store for awhile now and this is it. There are a few bugs though like when I start the game up it will crash at the start screen. There is also some lag and small bugs that could be fixed. overall though this game is worth it.

platform, perfect, Can't recommended this enough! And this is the perfect platform for this game!
game, fun, It's a very fun game that gets more challenging as you progress. Strategically planning the types of troops you're going to upgrade to combat the invading enemies and laying out a plan are important keys to winning a campaign. Game has high replay value. I would like to see more classes in the future such as support healers or super infantry would be cool.

files, saved, Edit: CLEAR YOUR GAME STORAGE. Customer support helped me resolve my issue. Five star game. Fun game, but I can't resume any saved files or build progress from campaign to campaign. It's frustrating to lose progress every time I begin to play. Please advise with a resolution. I've emailed as well.
archers, brute, the graphics are awesome and the game play meh, but the brute archers are the most op unfair enemy and your commanders dont always do what you tell them to do. The turn based system is weird and getting trapped on the second to last island because you cant move that far is so God damn annoying. I would like a refund

couple, first, I really enjoyed this game when I first got it. Decided to start playing again so I reinstalled and now it's won't load up. It's gets past the first couple of screens and then goes to an all black screen that says "Starting..." at the top but It never loads. Can't stand paying for a game and not being able to play it. Fix your issues!

game, saved, The game itself is a lot of fun and beautifully animated. The controls are intuitive and responsive. I found myself playing for about an hour before I took a break, but now when I try to load my saved game it just stays on the loading screen. No problem starting a new game, but it's frustrating losing my progress. Are there any responses on fixing this?

game, Brilliant, Brilliant game and I've really enjoy playing it and would recommend it to others ...HOWEVER less than 24hrs later after buying this game it now wont load. The game freezes for a while on the start screen when you first open the app but it eventually let's you select your saved games, ok fair enough. However then when I try to load my saved game it keeps crashing/freezing. Please if you are reading this developers, please sort out your awesome game. Its definitely worth a 5 star

idea, great, Great mobile RTS. It's no TD and that's good! I like that each unit feels unique, can evolve and may die, permanently. The auto-slomo while a unit is selected is a great idea. As is the constant progression of the vikings on the main map, generating a sense of overall strategy. Yet it's still mainly real-time and tactical, and I tend more and more towards turn-based strategy, so...

work, little, A visually pleasing and tactically demanding little work of art. There is virtually no explanation for how to play the game, but learning is half the fun (and it starts simple). Top hint: do not start your first campaign with no restarts allowed. Save that for when you get experience.

while, long, Fun game, unfortunately crashes fairly frequently and takes a long while to load up.
concept, cool, Love this game, such a cool concept, adorable art style and I love that you can play as little or as much as you want. There is an aspect that carries through to your future games so you have a sense of achievement but also each game is a new challenge, and I must reiterate, beutiful. Very fun and I definitely recommend

I hope this is fixed I really love this game, it fits perfectly on mobile and is a fantastic way to experience some rts flavour on the go. Neat graphics, rewarding challenge

game, great, Could be a great game but impossible difficulty, probably due to controls. Couldn't go past 50% of the campaign without losing commanders. And after investing all your resources into them there is no way to recover after losing them. It's impossible to coordinate defenses when attacked from multiple sides by the more advanced enemy units, it requires a degree of micromanagement that is not possible on such a small screen in real time. And you cannot issue commands while the game is paused. Shame

game, Gorgeous, Gorgeous game. Graphics simple but beautiful. The music , sound effects, voice of the characters(all kinds of "hmm") really adds to the effect: brutal Viking saga. It seems people are having trouble running this game. The devs will fix this eventually..I hope. The game deserves better rating.

run, good, From the gameplay point of view, this game is flawless. Love the artstyle and strategy mechanics. However, it is extremely frustrating when you are having s good run, make it to a checkpoint and then come back a day later just to see that all your progress is gone. Very annoying bug and if fixed I would definitely give 5 stars.

others, many, As many others are describing, the game fails to load. The gameplay itself is superb and the graphics are charming and pleasing to the eye. However, the inability to load save files makes the game unplayable for me and thus I cannot recommend it.
game, good, Very good game. I had no stability issues. The music and the graphics are very beautiful. The games difficulty is nicely increasing and the game is very addictive.
bursts, short, Simply fantastic, simple enough to play in short bursts, complex enough to hold your interest over multiple campaigns, and random maps keep things interesting. Hats off to any developer that takes the time to make such a high quality Android port. I initially gave a bad review since the game was deleting saves, but I am now convinced this issue is Google's fault. Just search for "google play games can't sign in" and look at all the results from the Google support forums. Should have known...

screen, smaller, Fun game on the PC, but doesn't translate well to a smaller screen. Units are difficult to distinguish and select, especially in the heat of battle.
game, friendly, Love this polished, offline friendly game. 2 minute skirmishes and great presentation. My save file got deleted once for some reason and I'm still giving it 5 stars.

time, second, Immediately fell in love with the art style. Brought it and started playing immediately. I love the game! But second time playing... Wouldn't load. Always stuck in loading bars... Reset the app, reset my phone, reset everything... Broken. The game won't load ever again :(
games, amazing, Keep bringing amazing games, like this one. Please !!!
game, fantastic, This is a fantastic and simple game! ...Well starts simple and gets increasingly difficult. I grabbed this on the PC a few months ago, this is identical! Awesome game 👍

screens, bigger, First of all I really do enjoy this game. However for some reason it just will not fit into the samsung s10 aspect ratio. It's really frustrating. I've tried everything so I came to the realisation that the developers need to update the game for the bigger screens.
rts, Great, Great little rts for the phone where you can upgrade your troops as the game progresses. No microtransactions or ads!!

launch, first, I can't even get the game to load up on the first launch. It seems to have an issue with the Google Play login
soldier, single, No matter how you position your troops 90% of the time a single enemy soldier will squeeze through and damage one of your buildings and thus ruin your chance at max points, i had a full lock down of the coast against a ship with 5 enemies and my units were at max health yet it still happened, very frustrating.

game, Great, Great game, when it lets you play! Such a fun game a with lovely style to the graphics and such smooth and quirky animation. Love it! However I've yet to complete a single campaign as after a while the game just won't load; I've been left waiting for my islands to be generated too many times. Really needs fixing, you pay a premium for no-ads indie games so it's frustrating to have these problems. I don't know if these problems occur on iPhone but it's not working properly on my Samsung.

game, good, A good game overall but I found the touch controls to be inconsistent and difficult to use. And this is a game where making even a small error in positioning a troop can end a run you've invested hours into.

game, great, This is a great game! I first tried it on PC, and when I saw it on Android I thought "what a perfect fit". It's a form of lite RTS with hero elements, perfect for bite-sized dip-ins, with really pleasing art and interface and a nice subtle soundscape. The only minor quibble is limited replayability, but it's totally worth it even for one campaign. I encountered no stability or save issues on a Galaxy Note 10, so maybe those reported previously have been fixed?

set, optimum, Super Addicting! Once you figure out your strategy, you'll love watching your army wipe the floor with the enemy! Granted I use the replay option, but it doesn't take long for me to get the optimum set up.
game, Amazing, Amazing game!
game, Great, Great game
data, saved, Spent over $6 and can't load saved data (on Android) . Should have read all the reviews before purchasing... considering the gameplay was alot of fun this ruined the app for me
game, good, It's a really good game. It's clever as the game play is set up in such a way that your tactics have to and do continue to develop and improve as you move through the difficulty level. From normal to hard to very hard. Also as it paid for there are no ads or extras to pay for or upgrade timers.
game, fun, Really fun game
game, Good, Good game, I love the style of the graphics. But I cant seem to find the save files. theres no folder called saves. Also there should be a button to allow us to speed up time
