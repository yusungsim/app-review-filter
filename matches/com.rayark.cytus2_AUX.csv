's, game, great, It, It's a great game for killing time, the mechanics are solid, it has a nice ui, a good variety of music and an interesting story. Overall a good game
's, game, wonderful, it, Well, it's a wonderful game. I have played it for a long time. But recently, the capso I get from each song is less than the before. For the former edition, I can get 1-5 capsos, but now, I just can get it 1 or 2 pieces. Besides, the flexibility of the game is worse and worse.
is, game, good, This, This is a good game, but, bad business practice. I played the game and it was actually fun. I do enjoy most of the characters, but, just personally don't vibe with some. Thats said, it has a terrible way of monetizing. Plagued with character paywalls to tempt you to unlock more songs rather than grinding level locks to do just that on free characters. No preview of songs attached to each character to give you a more informed decision. The high ~$14 price on each character doesn't help.
was, 4, solid, It, It was a solid 4 but I lost my data twice.
was, feel, lmfao, that, Owh men finally i bought again this game with my main acc üòÜ twice bought lmao cause i'm so loving this game ‚ô• i play osu but that was lmfao feel like drumming in phone don't like osu cytus 2 best of the the best rythm games for me
was, game, great, It, It was a great game, but my data got wiped out after I downloaded it for the 3rd time. I tried to contact support and they weren't much help. I know my account works because I had my progress the 2nd time I downloaded it. I had limited time skins and now they are gone just cause Rayark won't fix their game.

be, ending, bad, It, I mean this cytus is kinda of a great game but what happens if i don't kill Vanessa? It would be a bad ending you know Ivy died because of the Nates team i hate them :-P and Vanessa went mad i get a background called "together forever" . That is pretty sad of this story and thanks to cytus II for being a good creator of this game :) . And anyway there's an update of cytus II and im so excited ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö wooohoo
is, game, favourite, This, This is my favourite rhythm game and also i'm a fan at Rayark too...
're, levels, own, you, Great game!!!i absolutely adore it :) but one thing that makes me u know not like it that much it that you're not able to make you're own levels like can you imagine how incredibly the game would be if you could pick you're own song and make you're own level?!:O Also i would Absolutely love it if you add this song...in glitch mode its going to be impossible!!! Dimrain47-at the speed of light :) Keep up the good work
're, song, own, you, Great game!!!i absolutely adore it :) but one thing that makes me u know not like it that much it that you're not able to make you're own levels like can you imagine how incredibly the game would be if you could pick you're own song and make you're own level?!:O Also i would Absolutely love it if you add this song...in glitch mode its going to be impossible!!!

's, game, favorite, it, I gave 5 stars because it's still my favorite game I bought songs ang characters and got my account back after I change my phone. For those who are mad because you did not retrieve your old account that's your fault for not saving to cloud from the first placeü§™
's, mechanic, annoying, It, I think that cytus 2 is overall a great game. I'd give this game 4 stars, but two big drawbacks hold it back. First, grinding for the story. It's still an annoying mechanic where you have to play songs to advance the story. I wish it was possible to skip the grinding and enjoy the story. Second, calibration. The way rayark has been doing calibration is outdated when games like Arcaea and ADOFAI can detect the calibration with just a few taps. Also, they can go beyond cytus' 0.5 maximum.
's, game, best, it, Cytus II is not only the best mobile game I've ever played, but it's the best rhythm game I've ever played, period. I don't say that lightly as someone who's played everything from DDR to Taiko. The story is extremely fleshed out, the characters are all great, the presentation is clean, and the music is some of the best rhythm games have to offer.
is, game, first, This, Where do I even begin. No matter what I say, I can't start to describe how amazing and incredible this game is. The way it integrates gameplay mechanics with the story and the world of the game is beyond insane. And it pulls off the landing perfectly, while doing 20 flips midair. This is the first rhythm game I play where I'm more invested in the story, mysteries, and characters than the rhythm game aspect, which is nuts considering how much I love rhythm games. Just play the game.
was, player, avid, I, I was an avid player but then they started selling DLCs to enable loot boxes, nope, I'm not touching this game again
is, game, best, this, You know what? This was the best and a really good game but when you added miku? I Just don't know what to say anymore this is actually the best game there is and would love to see more!!!! (We eatin bread for 2 months BOIS)
is, game, best, This, Plz support full screen on 1080x2400 devices like poco x3 pro. Specifically the top notch area. This is the best rhythm game for Android for me.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game and it is the most loving story
is, story, loving, it, This is the best game and it is the most loving story
is, game, paid, it, I uses to play this and when I changed my phone, I could not download it to my new one cause it now is a paid game. It used to be free and there were other characters you needed to pay to play, and I can not even play anymore, why would you change that.
is, game, phenomenal, it, The game's great, the sounds are too. I don't know what I'm doing wrong - but my songs don't seem to save? All my progress wiped? It's frustrating. I've gotten the compensation and the post that it was fixed and I happily went back on to play again since it really is a phenomenal game. I've updated, but it still doesn't seem to save? Help?
's, screen, black, it, Why i can't play the game, it's just black screen immediately after i opened it.
's, game, fun, it, Besides being a very cool rhythm game, Cytus II has a wonderful and immersive storyline, which I enjoyed fully. The writing is elegant, every character feels alive. The music is also diverse too, which a bunch of different genres to chose from. My only complains are the paywalls and DLCs that lock you out of content you will enjoy, but other than that, the whole game and story can be played without any other purchases besides the initial one. Overall, it's a fun game to play, and a nice story.
is, screen, black, all, I am not able to login i have tried reinstalling it but all it shows is a black screen...is there any fix for it...pls respond
's, app, great, it, it's a great app with minor flaws
's, time, 3rd, It, Great game, but the option to play offline is gone now ( Ôºõ‚àÄÔºõ) Also, progress loss is pretty common even though there's an automatic cloud save bruh, please fix this. It's my 3rd time downloading this game again and starting from scratch
's, game, great, It, It's an extremely great game that I play over and over. The one problem is, I have to play over and over. It's not really storage efficient for updates and fills a phone quickly. Otherwise it's an amazing game. Edit: Turn on cloud save in-game . . .

am, one, only, i, why am i stuck on a black screen? is there also someone experiencing this? The gamr won't work and im just stuck on the black screen, am i the only one who's getting this bug? I've spent my money for this expensive game
was, game, good, It, It was a good game but I updated and lost all my progress :/
is, Joe, favorite, He, Still the best rhytm game so far and can never gets bored with it ‚ô° Good job Rayark! If you could, please do add more song for Connor, as his music are awesome, and I love his character. He is my favorite (also Joe!) and I keep playing his music üòä I know he is not the main characters but hopefully (someday) you might consider to add more of his music üòÅ update 29/9/21: please make this available to be played offline again T^T

is, DD, bad, This, This is Sweet :DD Too bad i wanted to play other characters to experience the songs they have but all i can do is watch it on yt D: But overall its all good! :DD Good work Rayark!
's, song, more, it, i like this game but still it's need more song
is, story, incredible, This, If I could rate this 10 stars I would... This is the most incredible story I've had the chance to experience in a while, if not my favorite, and I'm only halfway through the main game. Simply amazing.
's, game, great, it, I didn't even know if I liked rhythm games before I played this. That should say how good this game is. Apart from being an excellent rhythm game, it also has a pretty good story. Overall, it's a really great game.
is, game, great, This, This is a great rhythm game to play on a tablet. The songs aren't my favorite genre but they're good and well-integrated with the controls. Lots of free content and though there's even more paid content, I haven't felt the urge to buy anything yet. Which is good, because the stuff is expensive! The game has a story that sparks curiosity and the way in which you uncover the lore is fun and engaging. I signed up for just a rhythm game, and was pleasantly surprised by the worldbuilding.
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game give it a week try Vibe check
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but there's 2 problems I never had until now. First, we can't play offline anymore? I really liked the fact that I can play it wherever whenever and now I can't. Secondly, I turned on Cloud Save because I didn't want my progress to be lost and now every time I sync, it just stays on syncing and I don't know why. I have to actually go to the start screen again to get rid of that but it happens to every song I do nowadays...please consider fixing those it's really fun
be, love, amazing, that, Love all the Games made by you. The Essence of the music the rhythm, that touches your soul and make you emotional and energetic. The music is so great that I had to listen it again and again also not the least the story impressive all the digital elements. Can you just add voice-over for the message or the narrative in all characters voice that would be amazing love to see that in future. Regards for your future games.
is, fun, much, This, This is So much fun!!!! Actually I'm not that good at rythme game,but this is different.
's, game, wonderful, it, Was my favorite game, it still is btw. It's just I grinded this game for a very long period of time and sadly was forced to Uninstall after awhile I decided to install again and all of my progress was gone even though I remember saving my progress. Secondly i believe they removed the feature to play offline which made me very sad. But other than that, it's a very wonderful game with beautiful visuals and addictive gameplay that you can spend 100+ hours without getting bored or tired.
's, game, great, it, I love this game so much! First the graphics, I genuinely love everything about it, from the characters to the gameplay itself The gameplay, it's like a classic rythm game and it's easy to follow and play. I really like it unlike others mobile games Overall it's a great game.
's, game, great, it, Great story line and just like the first one it's a great game :)
is, game, best, this, Used to be my favorite game, but the removal of offline play is a deal breaker for me. Not sure what Rayark was thinking with that. Game data cannot be transferred between operating systems, and the leaderboard system is a joke. With that said, in terms of gameplay this is the best rhythm game out there. Great songs, handles smoothly, and a nice range of difficulty. Great story as well. I really want to give this game 5 stars and keep buying DLC, but there's just too many deal breakers.
's, one, best, it, Constant Internet connection requirement is a complete bs. Don't treat the game like it's some kind of MOBA. People play this because it's the best one out of the rythm games out there and the internet authentication process happens once in awhile.
was, game, absolute, This, This was my absolute favorite mobile game pretty much ever, particularly because I could play it offline during commutes or flights. I just tried to play it on a plane for the first time in a couple years and it now requires connection for auth? What?????? Please go back to being able to play offline. I've dropped so much money buying every song pack and character, I don't want to use data or pay for flight wifi to play.

's, move, bad, It, Deserves a place in the hall of actual best Android rythm games imo, yet someone gets too greedy. that in game intrusion is sad, the dev should have removed the offline tag altogether with that update so to keep your players. It's a bad move and it's too late
was, play, straight, all, Quality Rhythm game. If you like to try something new and get into Rhythm, this is the spot. Let it be known this is also a story base rhythm game, which adds more depth to playing, but most people might not like this feature if all they want was straight game play. Contains DLC at a price that I think is worth for the effort put into this game. Rayark tends to put their money into developing more content for their games. This is a Unique experience and immersive rhythm game unlike others.

's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game I love to play it at school when I can, but the update got rid of most of my progress an I sad because I'm now way back can someone please help me? And I was just about to buy all the characters because they were on sale.
's, game, cool, it, Honestly it just sucks that it drains my battery but other than that, it's a super cool, fast paced game that's also very story driven. I love it!

's, release, early, it, What can I say???! It's freakin' perfect!! The music, the charts, the emotions, the story, everything is perfect, been playing this since it's early release of the game and still addicted to it till now. The best music game ever!! Your money won't go to waste by giving the team a little support üòâ
is, time, second, This, This is second time after an update that i completed the game and maxed most to all of the characters and all of my data has been deleted.... i feel like ive wasted so much time.....
is, game, good, This, This is a good rhythm game but can you do a free dlc event? Pwease..
is, games, favorite, This, This is one of my all time favorite rhythm games and it's my intention to get 100TP on easy and hard charts. My review is rated as such because recently, I've been trying to save my progress on Cloud. When I attempt to save to cloud from the settings, the app either freezes or crashes. As a loyal fan of Cytus 2, I plea to have this problem/bug fixed. Thanks in advance!
's, game, good, it, I cant play the game, its crashing after a minute in. Bugs aside, it's a really good rythum game. Story is amazing but the problem is that its told in a complex way. Before, there were less characters to follow, less logs to read after each level up. Now theres 22 characters and leveling up is easier but it so much to read. It overwhelming, a easy solution is to hide a couple characters like Ivy, Crystal Punk, Vanessa, until the other characters have reached a specific level, then reveal them.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game I ever played!!! Thank you guys!!!
is, game, bad, this, Good game but absurdly overpriced music packs Really liked this game when I got into it that was until I got bored of the default music pack and decided to try other songs, and oh boy was I surprised, the pricing is so bad that it almost made me leave the game, for example for the cost of 4-5 packs you could get all the music packs + upcoming packs in muse dash with a free xp boost, now I'm not saying that this is a bad game, however they could've charged the game more instead of the DLC
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game that a lot of people enjoy (myself included) can't wait to see what's next
is, game, favourite, this, I think this is currently my favourite game in my phone Edit:it kept crashing after the update so i uninstalled and reinstalled and now lost my costumes and i lost quite alot of levels
was, game, favourite, This, This was my favourite game before the latest update. I can't even play now because it keeps crashing on both of my devices. Please fix this :(
're, songs, fantastic, they, great game. Its just like osu but in mobile. the beats are sync to my touch (this may vary through devices). the songs are abundances (free and paid) and they're all fantastic songs. although, the in-app purchase songs are kinda expensive lol.
's, game, great, It, (Edit: Extra star for adding DLC song bundles.) Great art, great music, great story, but the IAP is ridiculous. If your going to do this at least offer an all characters dlc bundle or season pass type thing. $120 to get the full story so far is utter nonsense especially if you want all the black market packs which raises it to $220. It's a great rhythm game and If it gets a console release with ALL the DLC I'll DEFINITELY give it a raving 5-Star review on whatever I get it on.
's, game, great, It, It's a great rhythm game, but too bad most of the song are paid in game
's, game, great, it, Kinda like Osu! But it's a great game and has a story line that you can ignore or play along with
's, optimization, bad, it, I honestly enjoy the game. It's got a lot of content, a lot of cool tracks and charts, and visually is very polished. But the game NEEDS to fix it's inputs. I'm not sure if it's bad optimization or poor programming or just a bug but having tight and responsive controls should be the main focus of your rythm game, not how many songs you have. Not being able to get passed a B because the game doesn't count every note is really annoying. Wouldn't reccomend in it's current state :/.

was, one, sad, This, Broke the game. Used to run fine no stuttering but now I can't get past the title screen. This was one of the best mobile games, sad to see it like this.
'm, one, only, I, okay since the update I experienced slow loading time frame rate drops, and I'm not the only one experiencing this issue, many people pointed it out. please fix it
was, untill, amazing, it, I've been playing this game for months now and it was amazing untill the last update, it gets stuck at loading screen and it's lagging a lot. I'll give it five star rating again after this issue is fixed. Update: Even after the latest update nothing's fixed.

's, something, magical, It, It's something magical >w<
's, game, Great, It, It's a Great game it's better than the first cytus but Sometimes it's getting laggy and the game doesn't start you have to restart the app to open it.
's, content, extra, it, The only mobile game worth playing. The base game is a full experience and if they want to sell you something, it's extra content with unlimited replayability. No limits, no pay to win mechanics, just you and the game.
is, take, own, This, Thank you devs! I wrote a review earlier this month complaining about the bugs and load times. Good news, theyre gone! Cytus II is back to its former glory. Very responsive, quick-paced, and challenging without it being impossible to figure out. Really the only thing bugging me is the somewhat grindy part of the game. I understand that there is lore and thats why characters should be grinded out, but it seems more forced upon you. This is mostly just my own take however. Its good and fun. N-Joy!
is, game, favorite, This, This is my favorite music game in mobile, I really recommend it, many songs need payment but there's also a lot of free too that are also good
is, game, heavy, it, Cytus 2 has the best story I've seen in a mobile game. Period. 5 stars for that masterpiece! However, the game does have flaws. It crashes and freezes every now and then, it is a heavy game using too much system resources, it consumes battery like hell and has some annoying charts, some with flick notes that just refuse to register properly half of the time. Some charts are basically unreadable and some notes can be hit before the scan line reaches it. Also, has a bit too many costly paywalls.
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game,BUT they force you to wait through a credit scene. It also have a tendency to freeze and crash.
's, game, good, it, i really like the game, from its character to its plot and especially the fun levels. it's just that the game keeps hanging and forcing me to leave it. would definitely bump it up if the issue is fixed, it's a good game apart from that though.
's, screen, black, it, ok vlgame but there is lots of crashes. i'm literally writing this review right after a crash happened the crashes aren't really frustrating but it's during songs that I think are catchy like for example aventyr every time I get to the screen where I'm gonna play it freezes and if I try to do anything else it's just a black screen and the most recent crash was when i was abt to play I'm just gonna call it "happiness" once it started it immediately froze but the music was still playing
is, game, great, it, Well it is a great game but most of the characters are not free
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game with great design but since the last update I've been experiencing alot of crashes. I hope the next update will fix it but for now it's almost unplayable which is a pity
is, game, favorite, This, Way better than Piano Tiles. I can't take public transportation without playing this. My only problem are these stories included in the game. I DO NOT CARE for the story at all. I just want to play! Add a frigging skip button. Such a waste of time. Also, why are some characters locked/maxed in their level? Just let me keep leveling them. This is my favorite game ever, but it has some really stupid minor flaws.
is, game, only, this, Rayark, please look into a bug that crashed the game mid play, also some characters take long to load (eg. the giraffe guy) Also bought all the story characters on sale, marking my highest mobile game purchase and still this is the only game that I've ever spent money on, BECAUSE ITS WORTH IT, cant wait for Deemo 2
is, game, good, This, I really like the character neko. The gameplay is really good as well. It has a depressing atmosphere but I guess its a keypoint that makes the game better. This is a good rythm game, good design and Im lucky getting it on a discount
is, game, awesome, this, Recently I encounter bugs where cutscenes unable to play properly, I get black screen when playing videos or cutscenes. That makes me need to restart every time it happens. Other than that, this is an awesome game. Rayark has been excellent in creating rhythm games. I've been your fan since 6 years ago ^^
