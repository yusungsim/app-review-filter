game, favorite, My favorite game in the entire series is on MOBILE NOW. Unique mechanics, pure stress that scrambles the human brain, and a hard mode that hard boils my blood. Even if John is tired with this series, I hope he will always remember Flumpty and his weird friends fondly. You'll always be a leggend, Johnochrome. Edit: someone rated it one star because there isn't a tutorial, even though it explains the mechanics in the song. Also Flumpty's games are meant to just throw you in with no tutorial. 🥚

fnaf, best, It's the best fnaf fg it's scary and I like it that way
game, awesome, This game is so cool because i had to be aware of everything. Really awesome game👍
vent, opened, SameasONAF1butiactuallygetclose2completingHardBoiledMode.OnlyproblemsrEyesaur&theOwl.Eyesaurwillpwnmeinstantlyifidontturnofftthelightswithin1second,andtheOwl,thecharacterdesigned2preventdarkcamping,alwayspwnsme when i am barraged by Flumpty and the crew. They always fly down the opened vent by exploiting the Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle, meaning if u get Redmanned, your face is pecked, Uranus is flat (lolwut?!), and your eyes will b sliced by the Egg God himself, Flumpty Bumpty! So no 1/5 :(
thing, more, Super awesome I made YouTube videos about it too go check it out now 😀 Well one more thing it's super hard it will be much more fun if you can here them moving because it will be easier when they come in the office. I mean when you can here them coming.
game, Nice, Nice game its cool.and scary

wen, scary, Its so scary wen they go away that guy who gos away
vents, left, Okay now this one is way scarier than the 1st one due to the laptop turning off, the owl either going to the left or right vents, and the golden egg. Man I love these kind of games cuz mostly I watch Youtubers play it and I said to myself would I dare myself to play these games and so I played them and I got jumpscared mostly. This is a great game for people that are related to fnaf.

screen, black, This game is great however i can't play it now for some reason when i open it it's a black screen
camera, single, Better than FNAF. Unlike in the original where you only really need the cameras for comfort, since you always have the lights, in this one every single camera comes to use. This makes this game so much more frantic, and you are on your toes one hundred percent of the time. It's a perfect balance of fast paced intensity and horror. The art and background music are fantastic too, they create a unique atmosphere which still manages to be scary. Gem. Love ya Jon.

asl, scary, I love it but at night its scary asl lol but I like it
night, hard, I love the game it's really challenging. But there is one thing I want added that would be cool. Like Fnaf, add a super hard night and then a custom night where we can choose how hard it is
stuff, Good, Good stuff glorys greatest
mode, boiled, I love how it's really challenging and even if you have completed it you still have hard boiled mode to play as well
bumty, flumpty, I like flumpty bumty
thing, good, I honestly love this game and think its really scary (thats a good thing) but i do have 1 complaint, it doesnt have good graphics it has low fps too, maybe if you put in better graphics it could be a lot better.
