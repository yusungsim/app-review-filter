novel, visual, This game or visual novel is one of the best I ever played. It deserves 5 stars. Though I think 2 endings at the end do not make much sense and only 5 endings would have been enough. The story is very connected and good, though at very beginning itt is a bit difficult to understand what is happening and where the story is going. Recommended. 😊

game, best, This is cool, I thought downloading this is a Mistake. but not, this is the best game. Downloading it now!
novel, short, It's fine as a short novel, but it's certainly not an adventure game and shouldn't be classified as such. It's a choose your reaction/ending. That's all.
version, free, I played the free version a few months ago and was IN LOVE with everyone and everything! I feel so many emotions while I play... I finished chapter 2 and cried again, and I love it. I love the characters, how they make me feel, the art and music, the story... EVERYTHING!! I want to replay this game again and again and hopefully find answers to the questions I still have from long ago.

bugs, Few, Few bugs here and there. Like it's hard to scroll down, and the buttons for choices are sensitive, even if you are just scrolling, you'll accidentally push one. Another thing, please add a choice where we can turn off auto play, like we can toggle it if we want it to play itself or we have to tap to continue. Other than than, I'm glad I bought this game.
time, first, This is my first time that i fall in love with story game >< goodjob!
story, Interesting, Interesting and touching story.
job, Good, It's amazing! The story's plot is great and entertaining, I've never been so focused about any storylines in some games but this game made me evaluate about the characters and the story itself. Good job!
novel, own, I love it! It needs to have its own novel and manga. Love every details and the story but I wish I knew how to use it, like, a help window or sth..? Idk what half of those things mean inside 😅
devs, Great, This game is interesting and heartwarming, Great job game devs. Great Stories Love it! Buying it is worth it! Btw my co-players, if you feel like the messages are going too fast you can slow it down at the menu or if you missed it you could scroll up the logs. Though yeah this game needs a pause button XD, but so far LOVE IT STILL.
game, quick, This game touched my heart so much! It was so well done, I haven't felt this emotional over a quick game in ever :')) I really loved the stories, the lessons, and the interactions the characters had. This is money well spent, thank you for making this game 💗

story, entire, The entire story is on auto-play, from what I can tell there is no way to pause the story from progressing. Even toggling to one of the menu options has no effect, the story keeps going even when you are not watching . The gameplay only stops when your character has to make a choice, this makes it difficult to enjoy. There are distractions in life and being able to pause in a text based novel seems like a feature that's a must.

way, real, First of all... WOW This game was so magical to play, I felt everything in such a real way. The story is such a beautiful trajectory I am so happy I was able to buy this game. It's worthy all the money I paid I promise, I wish there was more cause I would play this for days without getting bored, this was truly magnificent and magic, all of the creators made a good job I am proud of you. I loved this game!♡

heart, weak, I have a weak heart (٥↼_↼).. I got all the endings done already now, and got the true ending at first game, so after that I got depressed on how I was eager to get all the sad and horrible endings. Setting my emotions aside, I've already installed the free ver. of this game and then I thought of buying it! I'm really satisfied at buying this game, and happy because there are so many fanarts I can make as a pain relievers haha. I definitely recommend this visual novel. Why not try, right??( ꈍᴗꈍ)

game, good, It's quite a good game. I love the stories 💖
story, brilliant, You know i paid 70 bucks for a game but i got a brilliant story.... If you are making another part or something i rrally wish there are more game elements like a puzzle or more varied options..... I honestly did love the story so far tho.... But honestly.... Add more elements it would make it even better

complaint, only, I cried so much. Q.Q Edit: My only real complaint is that the text/scenes are rather difficult to "skip" through. This was especially apparent when replaying the different endings. Also, it would be better to send us to the timeline screen instead of forcing us back to CH 1.

version, free, I really like the story and animation. At first I downloaded free version, but I enjoyed it so much that I bought this one. Not to mention that you have to add savings to the cloud. When I deleted free version and downloaded this one, I had to start from the beginning.

story, more, This game is more story based than horror so it's a safe buy for anyone i guess. And it's a great story indeed! Animation is great, sound wise too. This game is a top contender of my best purchase of the year! One little thing that bothers me is that the game goes on automatically with only adjustable speed, without option to just manual go through.. still a 5 star game!

guy, looking, Is hoodie the monk looking guy from 7 Days? I like your games. The choices really feel like they matter, they aren't just multiple ways of choosing the same outcome. I haven't gone for multiple endings in this one yet but I'm really happy with the ending I got. I totally thought Hayden's hat was hair.

game, Good, Good game, but overrated. As someone who read a lot of light novels, its story is actualy pretty good. Artwork and presentation are neat. Music is nice but too few so its repeatitive. Story branching is not that impressive compare to other LN Ive played. Gameplay is also way too short. Shouldve added more dead end route so it feels like its actually a game not an ebook. Still, this game is worth trying if you are into games with good story.

game, cute, Such a cute game! It's very easy to navigate although it would nice to skip to a chapter to be able to change choices you've already made and it would be nice to be able to rewatch the cutscenes animations. But it's so cute, I don't mind replaying it! I definitely recommend ❤️

story, good, Luke chapter made me cry. That's a good story. I'm exciting to see another chapter. It's really worth to buy this game.
reviews, positive, I bought this because I was curious, bored, it was on sale, and I saw bunch of positive reviews here. And... turns out the reviews were right! I can relate to the protagonist because sometimes I feel left out in the society (which is sucks, actually). And seeing the development... it was great. I have achieved one ending and is planning to replay the game for another ending :)
story, good, It has a good story and fun to play
life, real, i hope the achievments on the game does really connected to google play so when the an achievment unlocked i also get the exp for my google play ;-; *the game are actually great! but the story were also really like my real life so i am not that very suprised. hope there are more advance mode or more story endings. 0:)

protagonist, depressed, The story is so beautiful and touching. Playing as a depressed protagonist (sorry if I'm wrong, I'm no psychologist) is new to me, I'm curious and scared at the same time. It might be easy to dismiss his feelings if you've never had depression before. To me, Eugene and Sean's issues are very real, and I can easily relate to them. It makes me feel better. So thank you for making this game. I love it. ❤

chapters, first, Just completed the first few chapters. Man what a tearjerker 🤧. The story hit so close to home. Love love love the characters and of course the art. Wish the story would pause when I open the settings and all. But I'm not complaining.

complaint, biggest, Just buy the game. Beat all endings. Savor the art, the story, every moment. The work from this studio is worth every penny. Edit: the office characters are EXTREMELY charming and interesting. My biggest complaint is we haven't get a chance to thoroughly explore their backstories more.
game, Best, Best game ever
quality, high, Well, guess who loved this game so much they decided to buy it! I love your job guys, thank you for making so many high-quality games! :))

app, free, Most definately worth the buy! I gave it a try on it's free app and snagged it's premium on sale. There's no microtransactions when you just buy the game or ads. Just a lovely story filled with a wide cast of wacky characters, all with their own character growth and story you unvail as you read. I also love how my choices feel like they matter.

game, interactive, Underworld Office is billed as a chat-style interactive storytelling game, so it's basically a choose-your-own-adventure with branching paths. This kind of setup allows for a fair bit of replayability if you'd like to see all of the game's endings, and thanks to a few collectible items, there's more than one reason to replay. It also doesn't hurt that the title offers a heartfelt story, so it should easily keep players coming back for a bit. This game is on sale and it's definitely worth it.

novel, first, The story is beautifully crafted, the character development is brilliantly executed. This first visual novel I ever paid for is a flawless masterpiece I will never forget! What's important here is the story. It touched me deeply, realizing how I'm bit same as the protagonist, I can relate easily, and made me sure that this visual novel indirectly has something else in mind other than entertainment, to help us reflect upon ourselves. Wish there's a sequel too. Definitely a buy, it's worth it!

horror, much, SPOILERS (kinda). This game is great. There wasn't as much horror and scare as i'd like, (There are maybe like a few jumpscare at chapter 1, but that's it) even though i have a PTSD, i just wish this game's story has more appeal to the horror side and at least gets a little scary overtime. Otherwise, good game!

novels, wholesome, I recommend this game for people, who enjoy wholesome visual novels with nice art (also, ignore most 1⭐ reviews, ppl somehow accidentally bought this game and wanted a refund)

genre, visual, Okay so i'll be honest. This game is very refreshing in the visual novel genre. I have played visual interactive novels before and their choices didn't do anything other than have 3 endings achievable by "intimacy points" earned in the choices. This one is different, whatever choice you make would literally alter your path, change the people you meet or go with, and i think that's pretty cool. Those who rated 1 star mostly just bought this game on accident and wanted a refund.

game, beautiful, Very beautiful game🥺 I normally don't play much interactive games because of how much microtransactions they give but this game was worth the money I spent on it. Firstly it wasn't at all expensive and such a beautiful story. If you like supernatural genre plots go for it and another reason I really really love this is THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is freaking touching and beautifully written with carefully animated scenes.

feature, skip, I really like the gameplay. I have to say i have shed some tears from kitty arc 😓. Eitherway i like the story and how it unfolds. Hoping more like this in the future and hoping that there is a skip feature to make gameplay fast especially i dont like repeatitive parts.
