was, battle, specific, it, It freezes constantly for no apparent reason. At first I thought it was just one specific battle but then it started happening so frequently at random times with no battle or even enemies on the screen that I couldn't even play for 10 minutes without it freezing.
is, labour, obvious, It, A well polished game that has a lot of quality of life features baked in. It is an obvious labour of love.
is, game, awesome, This, This is actually an awesome game!!
are, character, main, they, Love this game it brings me back to my World of Warcraft raiding days. Definitely not P2W. Well designed and balanced except for the issues below. EDIT: There needs to be a way to upgrade the healer to 7 stars like the rest of the players. Since the healers gear only comes from the Gold Dungeon, they fall behind the other raid members quickly. As they are the main character it is a pain that they become the weakest link and cause wipes most because they are the hardest to gear and cant be upgraded.
is, gem, hidden, It, It really is a hidden gem. I really like the game and the concept. Keep up the good work!
is, concept, whole, This, This is a whole new concept on the element of RPG gaming. And ive been a heavy RPG fan since way back in the super nintendo days when square soft was actually square soft lol. And ive been a beast ass healer in more than one MMORPG as well. But even that past practice doesnt really help with this game. Its really overall a simple dungeon floors type RPG. But the whole set up of how you build has me a bit intrigued. Well worth the 1$ i spent to get it.

is, simulation, amazing, this, Despite translation issues this is an amazing simulation of being a main healer and wrangling a party. Thank you for this game!
's, game, great, It, It's a great game, different than most others. Barely a tutorial, so you will need to spend a bit of time figuring out a few things. You can play most of it as a pure management game, or go into manual mode as the healer which is very fun. I was pleasantly surprised when I promoted my first teammate at the visual upgrade. The team AI is actually smart enough to move out of damage, the tank can pull aggro, healer on auto does a half decent job.

is, implemention, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic MMORPG raid implemention. I'm excited to see where development leads into the future.
's, simulation, good, It, I haven't played an RPG like this on mobile. It's a very good simulation of healing in an MMO but with a little guild management thrown in as well. I really like this game. I just wish that I understood it better. The tutorial is quick (which is good) but feels incomplete (which is not good). The game is lots of fun though, as long as you have the patience to explore what it has to offer. It is definitely worth much more than the $2 price tag.
is, game, cute, This, Great work dev. This is a cute and addictive game. Apart from the control scheme, while i cant say this game play design is of any grest innovation. But what make things work here is it takes many different good things in ither games and kinda merge them into 1 package. you like dungeon crawling? you have it here. you like loots? it is there. you like heroes collection? igs kinda there. you like idle game play, its there, too many to list. keep up the good work. pls continue to dev more contents
