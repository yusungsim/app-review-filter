levels, more, Game is awesome and can be very difficult to get to more levels. It would be nice if game would change colors for levels that have it's challenges met.
times, few, I've reinstalled this game a few times, wishing it would get better, but you're just working against circles without any satisfying resolution. This is in contrast to real life, where creating a subway or transit system DOES have good answers, albeit expensive and inconvenient: There IS a right or best way and it CAN be satisfying, UNLIKE THIS GAME. It contradicts the whole purpose of playing video games to antagonize players without substantial reward or accomplishment for completion.

game, Perfect, Perfect simple strategy game, where your progress is hindered only by the luck of the stage. While the rng is annoying it does give the game replayability so definitely worth getting and spending a few hours on.

player, new, This is a review from a new player and I can already tell this is a great and very addictive game. I have only run into one issue thus far - it can be very hard to tell on my small phone screen if a line is attached to a shape or merely next to it. Noticing this too late has caused most of my game overs so far. Could we get clearer a visual indicator of unattached shapes? A dot in the middle? Different color? Idk but this would really help my experience. Thanks!

map, successful, Interesting and innovative, but ultimately unforgiving. Takes half an hour to build up a successful map and a split second to bring it all down, which leads to frustration and an unwillingness to recreate an entire map.

game, Simple, Simple yet complex and super fun puzzle-ish strategy game based on game design theory. At first you think it's really easy but eventually your subway system will shut down due to overcrowding no matter how good you are at designing these line based systems. Plus they have a new game out called Mini Motorway which is similar to this but based on car traffic! It's not on phones yet unfortunately.

game, perfect, Basically the perfect transportation game. They hit the nail square on the head with concept...colours...music and sounds...design and so on and so on. Obviously I hope one day there is a full metro game (that can deal with more complexity (peak hours, transfer management, split lines, penalties for rebuilding etc). Great fun game.

games, better, "Engages" the player by going ridiculously fast and not allowing for pauses or breaks or thinking of any kind. There are better puzzle/system optimization games that don't cost money. The controls are terrible and the consequences of doing the wrong action are huge. Also the mechanic of the game ending because the subway is too popular doesn't make any sense realistically.

games, different, I wish every game could be like this. I enjoy different video games, but on my phone I like simple, logic puzzle games. The game looks so simple, but after a while I realized it's way deeper than I thought. This game doesn't rely on flashy graphics, instead it forces you to think. I love using logic to solve problems, and this is logic at its best. When you start, you have no idea what works, what's supposed to be done, but figuring that out is half the fun. Just experiment to see what works.

LOL, sound, Been playing the Steam PC version for years. I can tell you the Steam PC version is far better than the phone version: 1) Phone version is too small even on a 6.8" screen, 2) requires a lot of zooming in and zooming out, 3) Touch control is horrible if you don't zoom in first, 4) Your finger blocks your view, 5) Drains battery like crazy (and I should remind you your phone could explode if you charge while playing as it gets really warm), 6) You still get sound even after disabling sound LOL! (which is alright as its not as invasive). Other than that, it's a challenging game! The phone version scoreboard is separate from the PC version scoreboard. The phone scoreboard look more authentic; PC scoreboard has lots of cheat/fake scores.

platforms, multiple, I remember this game when it was only an Adobe Flash gameplay test. It's still a joy to play and I have it on multiple platforms. Simple, easy to learn, hard to master! P.S. Bucharest would be a great addition, especially of you add regions where you cannot bridge over / tunnel under, only block.

concept, Great, Great game concept that could be more realistic eg: units representing thousands of passengers instead of single people, and more logical locations for new stations. Although possible to pause the gameplay it doesn't take long for the system to collapse randomly. Nice interface though, hope it improves. Sometimes trains pass stations without collecting passengers :( The developers are adding cities but should also make the old ones more real. I'd like a Sydney map for its interesting geography.

AMOLED, proper, Still no proper AMOLED black for the interface. Also, game's RNG snowballs too quickly, with little chance to manuever yourself into redemption as things go SNAFU, which means game favors luck over skill. I get it that Mini Metro is all about surviving for as long as you can, but look at how Kingdom New Lands and Two Crowns ingeniously does that. Other than that, pleasant little pick-up game for quick 10-minute bursts.

distraction, engaging, This game is great, always fun for an engaging distraction. I'm hoping in the future they add more modes from PC, but check it out regardless! Edit, well they did it! I thought I updated this sooner, but they deserve the 5 stars, it's a great game! Endless is nice for someone like me who's not too great at the game and it's also good for practice to learn what really works.

problems, significant, I expected to love this more than I do, as the core concepts are pretty good. However, there's two significant problems: The music is non offensive but grating after about 5 minutes. They only just added an option to turn it off, that wasn't included from the get go Circles. Yes circles. The game has ridiculous circle spawn chances and eventually stops converting them to rarer shapes, leaving you with a massive surplus of them, generally all in one place too.

theory, addictive, I have a love hate relationship with this game. I think the game is brilliant in concept: addictive, interesting, basically graph theory brought to life. The weaknesses are how random the levels can be and this can impact your scores. Two high scores may not have the same meaning. The line drawing can be infuriating. Am I trying to move the rain, extend the line, or am I trying to remove a station? They all involve very similar motions.

players, mobile, I've played Mini Motorways before, which I feel would be better for mobile players, but this game has seemingly difficult controls, especially for people with large hands. I often find myself removing trains, creating new lines, and making existing lines move in on themselves, which creates a frustrating experience. But maybe that's part of the fun.

stations, new, Meh. Fun, but for twice got stuck in a situation where new stations stopped appearing because the map was full but I never lost the game, even after letting the phone alone for hours. Ended up exiting the map only to realise that score wasn't counted. So you can't be so good that you actually beat the game otherwise your score won't count.
game, Fantastic, Fantastic game.

game, Great, Great game, there's just a bug with resuming a game where it will load the game but none of my trains are running. It's very strange I cannot get them to move. I can a level to completion but I can't save and resume.
segment, real, Overall, this app is very confusing to use. There's no real tutorial segment, so you don't even get an explanation as to how everything works. Basically just Mini Motorway, but worse. If you have access to it, I recommend Mini Motorway 10x more than Mini Metro.

developers, same, I first got this because I couldn't get Mini Motorist and I wanted to try a game by the same developers. At first, I didn't really understand and like the game, but as I played more, studied up a bit and failed sometimes, I kept getting better and better with each run. For having this game less than a week, it's been a fun ride. If you're having trouble figuring it out, then stick with it. It's definitely worth it.

surprise, pleasant, It's really fun and there's much to learn. It can be peaceful, fast-paced or very difficult and worrying according to which mode you play. It's simple but requires a lot of thinking and planning, a pleasant surprise of aesthetic strategy game.

score, high, Amazing, addictive and simple. Pick up and play in a high-score subway simulator, and try and connect randomly placed and shaped stations popping up all over the map. At the end of each week, choose between more resources to manage your metro and stop stations from overcrowding, otherwise it's game over. As more passengers want to ride your metro, the more difficult it gets to keep up with demand. Easy to play, hard to master. Super fun and worth the money!

game, Good, Good game. The music is quite irritating though, and there isn't a way to turn it off without turning the rest of the in-game sound off. I can't wait for Mini Motorways to be released here.
motorway, mini, This game is not fun it is just colors and shaps and lines so my brother thot is was mini motorway so he got it and it is a rip of do not get it
game, Best, Best game I have ever played
game, wonderful, This is a wonderful, *wonderful* game! 😍 It is *definitely* worth the few dollars it's sold for. Just FYI: I'm not into trainspotting and I don't geek over train models. I just like looking at metro system maps. Looking forward to more levels 😉 Bangkok, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Busan, Hamburg, Hangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Nagoya, Osaka, Oslo, Philadelphia, Rome, Santiago, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Taipei, Tehran, Tianjin, Toronto, Vienna, Wuhan, Xi'an...

transportation, public, Very addicting. Excellent to play on public transportation.
game, simple, For such a simple game to have a complex challenge to it is refreshing in app stores full of repetitive copycat and pay-to-win or paywall games. Initially opening the game I thought it would take up just a bit of time. It has kept me coming back! I had to remove it from my home screen so I'd stop "one more minute" playing. There's always a new strategy to try and the challenges make you see new ways of completing the colorful maze of spaghetti geometry.

games, best, One of the best mobile games I've played. Love the minimalist style and there is a lot of depth in it's basic gameplay mechanics. It's the puzzle game I've been looking for.

game, cool, Very cool game. However, I'm stuck with 3 lines in every city. Even after winning a few weeks and getting a new line as reward, the game isn't making it available.

sound, faint, The game itself is great. There is this faint sound like a drill droning in the background whenever I play the game. Even when silent mode of the game, I can still hear it if my phone volume is high. Only happens with this game. Using Samsung note 9

playerbase, android, What is the point of supporting a developer who dosent really care of his android playerbase. Never going to support dinopoloclub again.
game, Great, Great game, teaches you how to manage
mate, good, lookin good mate
game, other, So first, I love this game. There isn't anything wrong with it. What is wrong is the developer thinks that platform exclusively is perfectly okay. Their other game Mini Motorways will never come to Android devices. This is not acceptable. Don't give me the "oh we've done exclusivity since the 80s because of gaming consoles". It was bad back then and it's stupid right now. If you truely believe that then why is it on PC and soon the Switch? So my review sits at 1 just as you don't care about us
time, long, Using this for a long time. Even if I am busy, I keep coming back to this for a quick break. Simply Awesome.

games, favorite, This game is fun, challenging, and addictive. It is one of my favorite games to play as a time waster or for a serious challenge. However having to leave a game with no way to save and continue is slightly annoying. Adding this function would definitely improve the game.

gameplay, same, Bought it cause I thought it had the same gameplay as shapez.io... not what I expected but I'm not also disappointed... this game is fun and less stressful in comparison to Factorio and shapez.io
tunnel, single, Fun game. But some times RNG will literally make it impossible for you to continue. On Stockholm I never once after 6 weeks got a single extra tunnel so it was impossible to connect to all ports.

game, good, A very good game, kinda ruined by circles. So many circles. Also the difficulty needs to be spread out more, it goes from very easy to very hard, very quickly.

orchestrations, such, Thank you! It is deeply satisfying to see such complex orchestrations emerge from such simple rules. I feel invited by the game to challenge my imagination. I play again and again, not to do better than before, but so that I can try out new ideas and find new interactions. With the simple control gestures, I get lost in a flow of drawing and shaping. The fun of playing Mini Metro comes from the seamless way I get the create and recreate until my figures have mapped out an elegant solution.

reason, only, I like the game the only reason it gets 4 stars is because whenever I try to play on my phone it sends me to Google play It would be nice if you can fix that. Also it would be nice if you added Moscow as a map

game, favorite, This is definitely my favorite game ever! It's so relaxing and fun! I remember when this game was at the indie exhibit at the EMP museum and look at where it is now! I do have one suggestion: I think you should add Boston to the game, that would be a challenging map!

playing, quiet, I am really enjoying this game so far, have about 3/4 of the maps unlocked. One gripe from me giving it 5 stars, LET US DISABLE THE VIBRATION. If I'm in a quiet area playing, hearing the vibration every few seconds gets old fast for anyone nearby. Please give us the option to disable it.

challenges, daily, Love it. Especially daily challenges. If I could change 1 thing - you can tap the achievements icon and see all the achievements earned and those that you may still complete . Wish you could just tap at the "to be completed " achievement to go straight to it. Instead I have to go back to the list of cities, scroll to the correct city and only then can I try to get that achievement.

games, Most, I've been excited to play this game but being colorblind it's rather difficult in standard. Most games use pastels or have a colourblind option that boosts the colours and gives them more depth to separate similar ones. If this could be implented that would be great but for now it's too unplayable for me :(

problem, major, I used my Play Pass trial to play this game, and I loved it! Finally got money to officially purchase it, and did. There is a major problem however: The Play Store still says I don't own it! Can you look into this? Edit: The problem has been resolved, thanks!

game, Interesting, Acted up during the tutorial refusing to recognize drags but after restarting works fine. Interesting game, a nice change.

line, third, I used to love this game, but for almost a year now theres been a bug where the third line you place doesn't pick up any passengers at all. I outlined all the details in an email, with screen recordings to Dino Polo Club, and they never even replied. A bit annoying, since I paid for the game on Steam too, and the same bug happens there too. Was a great game while it lasted, but uninstalled now

phone, mobile, Waste of a dollar. This game would be really good but the controls using a mobile phone are terrible I think this game would be much better on an iPad or larger device. If I try to remove and reroute one of my tracks it's impossible sometimes.

game, Casual, Teaches you how metrolinks work. Casual game don't take it seriously..
day, whole, I bought mini metro a while ago, played it once or twice, put it down. I went back to it today, and suddenly my whole day disappeared! It's is wickedly fun (albeit worryingly addictive!). I'd strongly strongly recommend it- not only are the mechanics intuitive but both the graphic and sound design are surefire winners

rng, much, Too much rng, game gets hard too quick, not good for children
others, many, Like many others in the reviews, I cannot connect stations as dragging doesn't seem to work. I'm disappointed that the developers don't appear to have addressed this issue which obviously affects quite as few users.
game, Great, Great game! Helped me deal with my ADHD
game, logical, Smooth, clear and stimulating logical thinking puzzle game. I recommend everyone to play it.
game, addictive, Very addictive game. Some suggestions: add a Tokyo map. It would be great to see a summary of my lines during the game, like how many locomotives and carriages on each line etc. Also it often forgets my highest scores for various cities.

scores, daily, I love this game, but very shortly after buying it for my laptop it became impossible to compare my daily challenge scores with other players. Now I keep getting messages that the challenges are on maps I don't have, but there is no automatic update and I can't find a way to repurchase on Windows.

instructions, Poor, Did not understand. Poor instructions. Not fun.
connections, more, Easy, adictive, but once you get more connections and stations you need thinner fingers. A zoom in/out feature would be nice.

challenges, more, Pretty good but very easy to beat the game. Wish it could have more challenges and modes. Glad I have a Play Pass trial, probably wouldn't buy the game directly.
complaint, small, Game is fun, but I have one small complaint and one bug I'm experiencing with it: I agree with another comment I read, the level difficulty does ramp up pretty fast after some point, and the bug is that I'm not getting any achievements into my Google Play Games. Not sure whether it's something regarding Games app settings, or Android version, but I have 0/57 even though I managed to achieve them inside the game, and the app is connected to the game. Edit: it got fixed, and got used to difficulty
app, Remarkable, Remarkable app. Both relaxing and challenging. Really like how the game looks in night mode!

The simplicity cloaks the difficulty of making a functional line, and effort and thought has to be put into it. A beautiful game!

times, multiple, This game needs a button to clear all your lines. As the complexity increases you frequently delete all your lines multiple times per game and having to drag each line through each station is excruciating. Furthermore there is an error where sometimes a new purple line won't have a train on it.

time, real, Very fun real-time puzzle game that gets challenging very quickly! The calm atmosphere and simplified visual style cleverly hides the challenge until it's too late - you're hooked now! I like the visuals that emulate real-world stylised metro maps, and the interface is fluid and pleasant to use. Lines snap nicely to stations and maintain the aesthetic even while you're placing them. I like how different levels have different characteristics, so it doesn't seem like too much of the same.

station, new, Fun game. If you have problems with the drag and drop just zoom first. The game should auto pause when a new station shows up until its connected. Theres no motive for me not to connect. I also find myself starved for information. Ultimately this game should run on a money system per customer and allow you to buy what I need.
game, interesting, Incredibly interesting game!
game, designed, It's a well designed game and very enjoyable. It's a puzzle game but it is constantly evolving and changing. I like to play it on the tube 😁
time, much, Painfully addictive! I spent waaaay too much time on this thing.
point, whole, Doesn't work. The game seems to load fine, but I am unable to make any connections between stations, which is the whole point. I've tried different ways but no dice. Not what I expect when I pay for a game.

game, simple, Incredibly simple game with deep complexity. It's the game devs' dream. This is the only game I have kept on my phone since I've bought it because it's fun and very easy to pick up and put down. I've been playing this game for years and it still feels like there's more to learn, which is astounding because there's not much to the game on a surface level.

phone, new, I love mini metro, I originally got it to play it on my tablet, but upon downloading it to my new phone as well (a Samsung Galaxy A51), I can press on the stations and the colored ring will appear around the station, but no matter what I do, no line appears and they simply won't connect. I would love to give this game a 5 star rating but it doesn't work on all platforms for me! If there is any way I could get some help to fix this I would gladly update to 5 stars, as it is a wonderful game!

game, Great, Great game! I realy like the gameplay, and the price is worth it since there are no ads or in game payments. So why is it a only four star rewiew then? Well, the music is just bad and it gives me a headace so i have to play without sounds. I would like if you added a decent music, it doesnt have to be perfect, but I feel like almost anything would be better then the current music. Anyway, i realy like the style of the graphics, it realy looks like the subway maps and i like it. Great game! 😀

map, given, Originally played this on my phone, which was sometimes difficult given map scale. Am now playing exclusively on a Chromebook, which makes gameplay much easier.The randomness of map generation can get aggravating, but that gives it more of an arcade feel, which is OK. Fun game overall.

stations, New, The rating on this game is waaaaay over rated! It didn't take more than 10 minutes to figure out that this game is bulls@#it. New stations pop up faster than you can earn "trains" "bridges" and "tracks" and than only gives one to pick from at a time instead of giving you both. It's an exercise in futility. If you want to play a game that literally gives you no chance of winning then this is for you! This game is an insult to rational people!

cent, single, Worth every single cent. I have this game on mobile and pc and even though Ive played it for many years I always seem to come back to it. It's relaxing, its management, its satisfying. The achievments are really doable, bit can be hard sometimes, bit that makes it even better: a bit of a challenge is good! I recommend this game to anyone who likes a chill game.

screenshot, final, (1) I'm fed up of accidentally hiding the pause button instead of clicking it. This is bad UX. I have no interest in hiding the speed controls. (2) I would love game history (final screenshot + anim; as data this must be tiny) for top score from each map + most recent 10 games. I frequently exit to check achievements and then regret not screenshotting my final network. (3) Google Play description of "Elaborate Dance Number" is wrong.

game, Great, Great game, can't wait for the 2ND one 👍
update, New, New update made the game unplayable. I can feed trains into a station as much as I want and they wont pick up passengers. I can add carriages to the trains. They still dont pick up passengers. My record was around 1200 and now I cant even get to 120.

thing, disappointing, A disappointing thing is that the new map for Chongqing is quite different from real Chongqing. The city, built on mountains and between rivers, has unique landscape and layout, which are not illustrated well. It can be done better even with the limited elements in the game.

game, nice, Would've loved some more features besides Tunnels, locs, carriages and interchanges but otherwise this is a really nice game. Some of the challenges can be really tricky to complete. That being said I never quite know why I've messed up or what I did wrong when I lose early.

people, Many, Its amazing. Many people criticise that the difficulty is not gradual - but that's literally the point. Cities grow rather exponentially, not gradual. I love every single aspect of the game, and the most critics to it are literally first world problems - in my opinion.

game, addictive, Quite an addictive simple game. Needs a few UI improvements though. Starting in a later city means lots of swiping, it would be good if the game remembered which city was last played. It's not clear which week you're in until you get to the end of each week and the game pauses, it would be good to have this displayed by the clock. Exiting the app relies on the Android swipe from the bottom to minimise and close the app rather than an exit option in the menu.

game, fun, Really fun game, but gets hard too fast. I have this on PC too and like that one more as it has more features and benefits from a bigger screen and a mouse. I've played this game for years and am just now reviewing this version. In the last 4 months, I've had some issues with achievements unlocking in Play Games. The game notifies me that I have completed an achievement, but when looking at what Google says, it still appears as locked. One for Chicago unlocked recently, but not Chongqing.

cities, several, Mini Metro is more than anything else a planning game. You will build a metro network for several different cities, starting from just a few stations and ending up with tens of them and countless interchanges. At a certain point you will always lose, but the fun is about how big and efficient your metro network will become! It requires very smart planning and tactical decisions, but at the same time the smooth music and the ability to pause anytime makes is very relaxing. Great game! 😃🚄

maps, unique, Reasonably engaging with unique maps, but the difficulty ramps up way too quickly. You go from being fine one "week" to having multiple stations overcrowding in the next- makes me not want to play when I know I'm just waiting for death. Randomness of end of week spawns offers adds to difficulty/fun, but is annoying when it never spawns the one thing you need. I'd prefer all options so then I could choose, then have specialty spawns for certain maps; ie Berlin only gets bridges every 3rd week.

For example, there is no way to delete just 1 segment of your metro, you have to delete the entire line and start that line over. The game also is fond of stretching your tunnel/bridge limits quickly, which I'm unsure if that is just part of the challenge or not, but it can go from easy to impossible very quick.

station, given, This is fun for a bit. It lacks any of the tools you would need to optimize for efficiency. Something that tells you what the load on a given station is, or the load on a line, or the number of transfers per shape or line... Just anything to help you see where there are problems so you can fix them.
lots, fun, Very fun lots of play different each time but one request add Los Angeles as a map
game, simple, A deceptively simple game. Offline and no ads.
game, Best, Adrenaline high. Best game i've played👌🏾. It would be really cool if you could include some sinple explanations about scheduling and optimisation in node theory so the lines can be more deliberately drawn and maybe some history of some of the train stations. A bogey mode where some lines are blown or bombed away can add some tension to the game to challenge the user to adapt. How on earth did you folks code for this?? AMAZING!!👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

version, mobile, Most of the 1 star reviews are from people who are clearly too stupid to understand and should just go back to Candy Crush! I already own this game on my PC but the mobile version is a great timekiller and really great to chill out to when on the move. The controls and game play are really intuitive whilst the game remains very simplistic looking.

nerd, slight, Love this game. As a slight Underground nerd this is the sort of stuff I love. It makes you think a hell of a lot more than originally thought you would. 5 star, no doubt
version, mobile, Loved the PC version. The mobile version is a bit more finicky, as there have been some issues adapting it to different controls, but I still like it very much. Gets a bit frustrating if played too long, but I do return to it occasionally, and enjoy myself greatly, just to put it away until the next burst.

game, Excellent, Excellent game. Despite its simplicity, its able to keep me engaged far more than any other game on my phone. Each level is unique and not redundant, which is something I thought might be a problem with 25 levels. All in all, an excellent game.

art, minimalist, Therapeutic, addictive and fun. I absolutely love the minimalist art and soundtrack. It is really nice to have the option to continue the game in Endless mode once the stations finally overcrowd too! I am also excited to see that new maps are being introduced, I had assumed that there wouldn't be any more!

potential, huge, After reaviling it's mechanics, game quickly becomes too boring at start of each city and suddenly goes overcomplicated and distracting. Developer does not have idea how to gradually balance the gameplay. It's a shame because of a huge potential!
game, addictive, An addictive little game with a clever concept, easy to play but very difficult to master. The interface is elegant and fairly intuitive, although it can be difficult to detach stations from tracks. I love the real world locations!

mechanics, Nice, Nice, straight forward mechanics. Starts easy but gets hard quickly! New stations have a habit of popping up exactly where I don't want them. Is that by design? If so it's deliciously evil.

game, nice, What a nice frickin game!
game, Great, Great minimalist type game, simple enough to understand right off the bat. I appreciate the fact that there's no messing around with any lengthy unnecessary tutorials (the mechanics are simple enough to not warrant one, It's seriously not that difficult) the controls are a bit finicky, I find it hard to remove a track from a station, and everytime I do manage to do it I have no idea how I did it, but apart from that definitely worth the 99 cents.

game, Perfect, There's nothing else like it. Chill and stylish, but deceptively puzzling. Perfect zen game to play while listening to podcasts.
blue, dark, I enjoy the game, but it can get repetitive, especially when one of the challenges is essentially impossible, so you try over and over and over. Doesn't seem super balanced. Also wish you could pick the colors? The dark blue is invisible in night mode.
game, full, I dont think there is anything wrong with spending money on a game that you're dedicating time to, even if that game happens to be on your phone. People deserve to be paid for their labor! That said, this may be the best $1 I've ever spent, especially on a phone game. The mechanics are simple yet engaging, and the color schemes are just gorgeous. The full game is unlocked for your $1, plus there are NO ADS AT ALL. Give these people your money!

simulation, simple, Quite a simple simulation on the face of it, but there's quite a lot of depth. It's not free, but very cheap and no adverts. There's just enough randomness that means replaying a scenario is familiar but sufficiently different each time. Graphics are simple but sufficient, and the animation is extremely fluid. There's daily challenges, but it feels a little artificial, but perhaps because I've not mastered the game yet!

thing, single, Train go brr but also break my heart :( Seriously tho this game confuses me, I wish I had a dashboard or something. Maybe a single out thing so I can focus on one track, this game is ruthless and unforgiving and dont think for a second that it'll give you a break, it's always something new to crush you and I love it.

money, real, I'm very hesitant to pay real money for apps on my phone because I get awful guilt after spending money. However, I bought this game the other day and have been playing it since.

game, only, This is the only game I've ever bought in more than one platform, that's how much I like and recommend it. Got it for PC years ago on Steam, then recently got it again for Android, there's something poetic in playing it on your phone while riding one of the transit networks it emulates.

train, empty, Sometimes trains will not pickup passengers. I watched an empty train go in circles passing a full train stop again and again until I lost the game. Other than that, super fun game! It is a little bit hard to control / tap on the right object though.

game, Great, Great game but i find it hard to pick up the lines.
interface, such, The game is simply addicting. With such simple interface and gameplay, you have to think the best way possible to line up the railway. You also want to think about line efficiency, somehow as the level progress, the stations will be crowded and you have to move the passengers otherwise the game will over. It's a fun game, but challenging as well.

creator, Best, Best and only metro creator, 1$ is definitely worth it 💗
instructions, more, I think it needs more instructions. Editing stations and lines and what the different shapes mean. It looks like it would be really fun if I had a better understanding of what to do. (added a star because it is available with play pass)

tutorial, detailed, This game is worth the price. The graphics and "controls" are great, and the gameplay is challenging but fun. I like the puzzle like aspect. It doesn't have a very detailed tutorial. I know it is the style of the game to be simple but I am slightly confused as to why my trains sometimes pass by passengers without picking them up, even if it is empty. I recommend this game.

metro, first, Wish to see my city Kolkata. Although Mumbai is included in the map. Just so that the developers know India's first metro was introduced in Kolkata. Now it is being extended through tunnels under Ganga. It will be an interesting map to play I believe. Would love to see my city!

cities, other, Very relaxing and really enjoy playing it. Only downside is that it's a bit too easy to unlock other cities. I get that this isnt a "challeng-y unlock them all" kind of game, you can chill out and play in endless mode all day and be so relaxed you melt into wherever you're sitting. The music(?) Is calming and the little bloops the trains make is delightful. I just wish I didnt unlock them all so quickly so I could enjoy discovering them all over again
