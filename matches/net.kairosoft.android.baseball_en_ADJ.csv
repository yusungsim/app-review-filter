fun, much, So much fun
weeks, last, I didn't particularly enjoy baseball before buying this game but after having played it for the last two weeks i can say I've gained a much better appreciation for baseball and it's strategies. The game is designed well and is just purely fun to play. I got invested in my players and when they graduated i was always bummed to see em go. My only complaint is your team never starts 2nd and no home field. The game was so enjoyable that I'll have to check out some more games from this developer.

inning, 9th, I won the summer tournament 9 - 8. It was the 9th inning with the other team on third base 2 outs, 2 strikes, and 3 balls. Thought the enemy batter would get a homerun to win the game but my pitcher Bob Man came in clutch and struck him out. 10/10 would get a heart attack again.

work, great, All of the games creates by this company are fantastic! I would recommend making a American Football version into a game, because that would be something I would highly enjoy and I'm sure a lot of others would too! Keep up the great work!

combination, wonderful, Kairosoft and baseball turns out to be a wonderful combination. Always knocking out of the park with their games, this here is another example of the greatness their games deliver on.
work, good, This game is amazing and I really like this. But I think it could be better. It could allow you to save data so you don't have to start from 0 again after you reinstall. New Game + it's amazing. However, as I said before, a cloud save would be awesome. Keep up the good work!
waster, huge, The game is great and a huge time waster! Controls could use some reworking though. Still a must buy for fans of managing teams. Even if you're not a baseball fan you'd enjoy this game. I feel like the XP you gain from training sometime isn't enough. Does become a grind to improve players.

game, good, +:It's a good Kairosoft game. If you like most of their older games, you'll like this one too. -:The amount of tapping needed to move through the dialog is a bit much. And the amout of time between two matches is way to short. So you'll have to hurry with everything you do if you have a tournament running+friendlies.

I would be amazed if you made some wrestling/sumo game with goofy throw/ body slam animations. There are tons of sumo rankings and size isn't all it takes to be a top tier yokozuna. A swimming game could be unique and simple for those who like aquatic style sports (Diving, Swimming). I woul be down for a basketball story game that could relate to the anime Slam Dunk or Kuroko

game, great, A homerun for Kairosoft,  again.. a great game , if you are a fan of baseball. It is worth the price.
imbalance, severe, Overall it's fun, but there's a severe imbalance when it comes to facing teams that are about on par with you or slightly better. I would expect to lose more often than not, but usually you just get slaughtered. This would only be a moderate problem if you didn't need to beat those better teams to get most of the better players.   Never being the home team needs to be fixed. Baseball is the only sport where the home team has a significant rules advantage, and you never get it in this game.   Training players requires too many points. It also requires way too much investment to get to the top levels of your school stats. In game power-ups rarely seem to be worth it. I hate the game's decision making when it comes to bunting, because I never want to bunt. The game is very inconsistent when identifying clutch moments.

It also requires way too much investment to get to the top levels of your school stats. In game power-ups rarely seem to be worth it. I hate the game's decision making when it comes to bunting, because I never want to bunt. The game is very inconsistent when identifying clutch moments.
players, better, Overall it's fun, but there's a severe imbalance when it comes to facing teams that are about on par with you or slightly better. I would expect to lose more often than not, but usually you just get slaughtered.

fan, huge, I've been a fan of Kairosoft for years, and I'm also a huge baseball fan. Needless to say, this one hit the sweet spot. Bit of a learning curve, with some surprising depth. All in all, Kairosoft hit a home run with this solid mid-season pickup.

game, only, 1 star because for some reason it is the only kairosoft game that gives me an error on start up and fails to launch on my Nvidia shield. It works fine on my phone but this rating stands until it's fixed on my tablet.

time, free, I love all if the Kairosoft games, not to mention for me to spend $5 on a game on my phone is almost unheard of but I've boughten almost all of them now. I would love to see them make a football one or maybe like a Boxing one that would be fun to see. Thanks again developers much appericate you ladies and gentlemen for takeing almost all of my free time  hahaha
months, longer, Very fun, but would enjoy longer months and one more term. Adding the option to specify your training for individual players would improve team building.

game, great, This is a great game I like the fact that they trick you when it's time to write a report when you win the summer series just to take you over here to give it a review but overall the challenge of losing your main characters and rebuilding to win the game it's a lot of fun I would recommend this to anyone

time, first, It definitely follows the pattern of a Kairosoft game, which can sometimes feel tired, but I've really enjoyed their sports games. Reminds me of the first time with their soccer sim. Very well worth the money.
time, enough, I think the game is good but, losing your members really takes the fun out of it.  I feel like I don't get enough time with my players to really make a dominating team.  Which would be great if the game was more interactive.  However the entire premise of the game is to watch your n00bs become pros.  So when you lose them it's like what's the point of play?  It would've been amazing otherwise. 4/5

way, better, Honestly, yea I lose players. But they actually return sometimes better as a COACH think of it in a better way. You need to train first stringers. I work team A as Year 1 (they start as Team C). Each year, I move the players up. I only train Team C for 2 years.  Team C winds up better than Team A and has the ratings needed to succeed. I do this in all renditions of the team. In year 7 my current team has a S rating while my B team is A and my C team is C.  Its all about your priorities. You will not succeed early and this game is FINALLY what Kairosoft had been striving for. Balance in game and Quality of Life for players.  I can get a million hours out of this game and just be happy with the sheer work I have to put in to make my team better.

results, Great, Great but tournament results don't matter. I'm forced to play teams that have been knocked out.
game, Great, Great game. For the people who say it's frustrating that you have to restart training players again, they come back as freshman. You have to go two cycles through and then you will start seeing your old players return.

games, new, I love this game. I love all the Kariosoft games and is always checking the website to see ifmthere are new games out I have bought and downloaded evary game.
rewards, better, Awful. There is literally no point in winning because you get better rewards for losing!! Using cheer point for a boost will have no effect 87% of the time. It's really really bad. Hope you enjoyed leveling up your players because they are gone in four years and you get to start over. Just a sad game.

sim, deep, A very deep and engaging baseball team sim, based off of Japanese high school baseball.

game, first, I love Kairosoft game since their first game, Game Dev Story. This game is awesome, but managing and making your player became pro is rather hard, but that's where the fun relies.
school, High, So, I love that i was listened to about this game. I wanted it in English. This game is pretty good. My suggestion, it should be 4 year terms. High school is 4 years, for us in the US. And i just noticed a bug that cost me in the realm of 30,000 G. I went to place an object and didn't want it. When I put it back, I lost that money!

days, full, 8 get hooked with this for 3 days full until i forgot to write a review. Good job as always! Love the game. But please don't forget to translate the pawn shop game too~

grindy, pretty, Starts slow but gets pretty grindy later on. For people complaining about 3rd years leaving, this is a High School baseball sim so it makes sense. Spoilers, some of the 3rd years do come back as 1st years in later years. So you can still focus on building up a group of players and wait for them to return.   Great game by Kairosoft, as long as you invest in learning all of its mechanics.

players, build, Agreing with others about the "build up players who then leave and you have to start over" hurts the game. Reminds me of some mediocre Kairosoft games of the past with similar mechanics. Like the horse racing one. Artificially extended grinding hurts games, and unlike Pocket Academy or Dream House Days, your 'players' aren't recycled, at least as far as I've seen.  Would be better if it was more like Pocket League or the tennis spinoff.  A swing and a miss, I guess. Better luck next time, Kairo.

orientation, opposite, The game itself is pretty fun. but it is locked in landscape orientation all the time.  Not only that but you cannot flip the screen 180 degrees to the opposite orientation.  This is a huge annoyance when playing with it charging, but the charging port is on the wrong side for your charger.  And along with the recent trend in Kairosoft games, this game also turns off your music player when you open it.  I also think it would be better if this was pro baseball instead of high school.  I's kind of annoying that you build up players, but only have them for three years.  Early in the game it is very difficult to recover after your third years graduate and leave.

And along with the recent trend in Kairosoft games, this game also turns off your music player when you open it.  I also think it would be better if this was pro baseball instead of high school.  I's kind of annoying that you build up players, but only have them for three years.  Early in the game it is very difficult to recover after your third years graduate and leave.
