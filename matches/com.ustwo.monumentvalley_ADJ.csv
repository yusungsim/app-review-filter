set, known, Not for me. I found the puzzles were less about finding a solution from a known set of constraints and more figuring out what the developer wants you to do. At its worst it's just mindless trial and error. Not bad in other areas, good creative graphics and slick visuals, but the gameplay is not for me.

tutorial, first, I am using Galaxy Note 20 and the game cannot detect the stylus correctly, i.e. cannot rotate the wheel properly in the first tutorial. However, it works well in Monument Valley 2. Refund.

puzzles, harder, Relaxing, well made, worth the money. I wish there were a lot harder puzzles but honestly it's still amazing.
perspective, different, The level design can only be described as a work of art. Working your way through a level never feels overly difficult to the point of annoyance, but always feels rewarding when you are able to look at things from a different perspective - literally. Monument Valley is amazing!
structure, higher, This game is AMAZING! The puzzles are fascinating with higher dimensional structure. Really well done. Soothing and interactively musical. 10/5 stars honestly. üî•

game, entertaining, very entertaining game, had a lot of fun
game, fabulous, Absolutely fabulous game. Arguably the finest Android game I've played so far. Just gorgeous art and sound design. The puzzles are clever but not extremely challenging; they're just taxing enough to keep you interested without making you tired. Fans of MC Escher and optical illusions will adore this game. The main campaign will take you around an hour to 90 minutes to complete. I can't wait to try the DLC levels and, eventually, the sequel!

Just sad I blew through them all b/c I couldn't put it down. (And per suggestion in Monument Valley 1 I made a sizable donation to do 1 of my favorite charities.) Hoping for 3rd soon!!

game, okay, It's an okay game but it's not nearly as long as it should be for a paid app, and the fact that you're asked to pay for extra levels once you've already paid to download the game? I found that to be outrageous. Don't buy this game if you're expecting hours of fun. You get maybe one hour of game play and then have to pay for more.

gameplay, pure, I absolutely love this game I see no problems with it, there's no ads and no bugs from my knowledge. It's just pure gameplay and I find it really cool that the levels are set up the way they are, and how there are so many illusions included in one level! If you're looking for a fun puzzle game this is definitely what you want!

game, Lovely, Lovely, clever little game. The Escher style layouts are very interesting and some times tricky to see your way out. Only downside is that it is not very long, and you can finish it in a day.

idea, cool, Such a cool idea but now that it has been imitated to death it's interesting to go back to the original and see how it holds up. Answer: not so well. There's hardly a game here, it's all super linear with the next step being obvious 80% of the time.

props, Huge, I completed both versions of this game in less than two days. It is joyfully confusing, and so incredibly fun. Huge props to the developers for designing such a clean and crisp game, and for coming up with amazing levels that are all so entertaining.

eyes, other, The game is beautiful, the soundtrack is so relaxing; and the puzzles are amazing. The way the game challanges you to see the world with other eyes in order to solve the puzzles is incredible. The logic of the game can be hard to grasp at first, but once you understand it, each level is a joy. Level 6 really touched me.

The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but its the graphics, the atmosphere and most all the mere game play - which borders on the bizarre for some and is just pure fun for others - that makes this worth every $ I spend for it.

More and I would have gotten sick of it as thing do start to feel repetitive after a while. The graphics are very nice as is the music although, there again, things do start to sound repetitive after a few levels. Not a bad game though. Maybe I've just played too many of these kind of games over the years.

skirt, blowing, I am not a gamer, just a busy German Mother who does not take time for anything! But this game captured me, it's very detailed with the blowing skirt and dangling legs. I think the creators should get a reward for this outstanding game. Keep up the good work! I am intrigued by your skills! And that's the brutal truth!

review, original, *Update* My original review included that I could not play this on my 14 inch 2 in 1 Chromebook. I figured out that you have to play it through Google Games and fold it to tablet "mode". worked fine and looks gorgeous on a large screen. It is a bit short. Played the extra level that you have to find in the menu. Will probably buy the extra levels. Love the music and parts of chapters had me stumped a bit but figured them out. Will probably play both games many times. A fun and relaxing game.

gem, Super, Super innovative little gem. Reminds me of Fez. Like taking a walk in Escher's artwork. Short, to the point, no filler, doesn't get old, and until the very end introduces pleasent mind-breaking surprises. Nevertheless, I missed some more challenging levels that test your understanding of the mechanics.

game, Beautiful, Beautiful game but far too short and unchallenging. I'd rate the difficulty suitable for age group 6 to 10 years old. I wish more developers would give a clue in the description as to what age group the game is intended for or have some sort of complexity rating... I would have passed on this one. Also, it says that progress is saved to pick up where you left off. That wasn't the case for me even registered with Google play, I had to begin a chapter from the beginning if I left the game.

downside, only, I love this game. So well made, well thought out and beautiful too. The only downside is that this and monument 2 are over so soon. I wanted to keep playing forever!
reviews, positive, Beware! This game is EXTREMELY SHORT!!! I feel like all the positive reviews just add to the scam that is this game.
puzzle, mobile, Possibly if not the best mobile puzzle game I've ever seen, the music, the storytelling, the levels, everything just goes together so so well, great job devs.

vague, weird, The puzzles are somewhat interesting, but the story is just plain weird/vague. It was ok playing once for free, but I'm not sure I'd play the sequel(s).
geometry, sacred, A masterpiece. The game devs took sacred geometry and made it into a beautiful, fun, surprising, and challenging game. The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the complexity of the puzzles is a winning combination. The mystical, fantastical elements made me smile. Can't wait to finish this and play Monument Valley 2!

game, horrible, I just played the most horrible architectural puzzle game called Odie's dimension. Story text was off screen, horrible sensitivity, and in the third chapter there was a walking pattern to go through that was utterly ridiculous. As I'm playing the third chapter all I can think is "Man I need to re-download Monument Valley." I re-download Monument Valley and uninstall Odie's Dimension and I haven't even passed the second chapter and I want to worship the devs. Thanks for making such a great gameüòÅ

As I'm playing the third chapter all I can think is "Man I need to re-download Monument Valley." I re-download Monument Valley and uninstall Odie's Dimension and I haven't even passed the second chapter and I want to worship the devs. Thanks for making such a great gameüòÅ

time, good, It's a pretty good time waster, with mind bending puzzles, a unique art style, and quite a bit more. I suggest playing if you like puzzle games.

surprise, unexpected, This game was an unexpected surprise! I love puzzle games that make you think outside the box. Monument Valley definitely delivered in the most beautiful way! My only complaint is that I didn't want the game to end, but it did. Immediately bought MV2 and was not disappointed. I hope the devs continue this story!

work, beautiful, A beautiful work of interactive art. Visually mind bending at times but not difficult; it tricks you into thinking you're being smarter than you're ever really required to be.

concept, interesting, Very interesting and immersive concept. Flawless puzzles and encountered no glitches and bugs. Like many others, I am DISSAPOINTED. For a game with such a high rating, (4.8 / 5) I thought this game will be fullfilling. But you can easily finish this game in an hour and a half. I would liked it to be longer and harder like the IDA's Dream Chapter / Chapter 10 as I breezed through all the puzzles. I appreciate the quality > quantity but this game would be 10x better if it had quality AND quantity

phzzles, nice, Honestly nice phzzles and all but the problem i faced was theres just not enough content for what i purchased, all the puzzles are not hard but thats intentional i bet, so apart from the lack of content its quite good, wont be buying the sequel though if its the same lack-of-content style but for 5 quid this time.

game, beautiful, Loved it! It's on my YouTube, Aelaofalba Its a beautiful game with such unique puzzles, one or two I even had to cheat on and look at a walk through because they just get harder as you go on. Nevertheless it was really fun and a pleasure to play such beautiful artwork. Can't wait for the 2nd one.

game, Beautiful, Beautiful game. Interesting, challenging but not so much that it pisses you off. It's very meditative and it's easy to lose track of time while playing. I grew up with a father who loves MC Escher and had multiple prints in our home. I would stare at those as a child wondering where each door lead and wondering what it would be like to be IN those drawings. This game gives you that ability. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

soundtracks, calm, It's simply just perfect. I love the calm soundtracks, too, all the ideas behind it, the story, the- the... everything. It's a logical game and it's nothing for the price! It's just so good!

nights, few, It was brilliant, but it was over too soon. relaxing game, was very well made then it was over!!.i had stupidly assumed that i could play it for a few nights at least. dissapointing. I cant see how one plays it again as there is only one way to solve each puzzle. I prefere a game that i can play for longer than an hour. But its still well made and beautiful and worth buying. Just dont expect to be playing it for long and you wont be dissapointed by it. Its truly beautiful.

In fact you feel really good about what you paid for as being super worth it even if it were double or triple the cost. What a concept, huh?

The puzzles are intriguing and every one is better than it's predecessor. This game is worth every penny, and is suitable for pretty much every age (I'd say 7+, because the puzzles may be a bit hard on younger children).

benefits, cognitive, I love this game. It certainly has a number of cognitive benefits. I was very excited to purchase the "no ad" version because the ads were very disruptive; but I still receive an annoying number ads. I was charged abt $1.00 more than advertised. Also, you are only allowed to play the game a few times per day. It will let you watch an ad to get another turn; but after that, you're done for the day. That's not exactly what I had in mind when I bought the game. Otherwise, would have rated 5 stars.

I'm absolutely in love with the designs of the characters as well as the levels themselves and appreciate the way the game makes you really have to think.

The idea of manipulating environments built upon impossible architecture is amazing. The entire game has this mysterious and mesmerising, whilst also calming atmosphere.

idea, cool, Such a cool idea to build a game based on an optical illusion, and it's so much fun! Perfect level of difficulty all the way through, including Forgotten Shores. I can't even imagine conceptualizing and designing the levels; it must've been a huge challenge to make this game. I also love the atmosphere, the music, and the sound design. Looking forward to playing the second one.

time, same, Rare to find a game this esthetically beautiful plus meaningful at the same time. I truly enjoyed playing this game, from Ida's complex journey and the lessons she (and the player) can learn from it is amazing. The levels are far from easy but very logically challenging. Highly recommend!

franchise, great, Enjoyable! I completed the game in two days time including the dlc and the side story with a total of about 1 1/2hrs to 2hrs. Then I played MV2 and completed that in a day. This is one great franchise to continue on with, I will be looking forward to seeing MV 3, 4 and so on... I'm ready for a storyline with twins searching for each other as they use the elements. You could introduce an app where we could create levels that could be playable by others with each new game that's released.

You could introduce an app where we could create levels that could be playable by others with each new game that's released.
game, Great, Amazing! Great game. Bit short, but other than that wonderful.
use, common, The Details are so immense. I really love the common use of optical illusions. It is like it needs you to use common sense. The story is good. And the levels are equally diverse, unique, and pretty.

game, fun, A really fun puzzle game that forces you to think outside the box, though it's not annoyingly difficult. The main portion of the game can be completed within a couple of hours if you play straight through. There's also a bonus set of levels you can purchase for about half the price of the main game, and it's just as enjoyable. The way the moveable objects in the game produce musical notes of various instruments is clever and adds to the enjoyment. The background music is also very calming.

example, brilliant, (SPOILER kind of) This game is a brilliant example of story telling and puzzle. I initally sort this game out for a YouTube video, and was only gonna play the first 5 levels. But I got hooked, and decided to complete it (and get 2 videos out of it). The ending was nice, after level 9 when the little girl put the flower down. This game is bitter sweet. On top of that, I have the DLC to play and the standalone adventure. Thank you for a brilliant brilliant game. I thoroughly enjoyed this.

periods, long, I loved the storyline and the art, and the levels weren't super frustrating, so it kept me playing for very long periods of time. It kept the story moving, and it provided a nice balance between full enjoying the storytelling, soundtrack, and gameplay.

game, enjoyable, A very enjoyable game for me at 59 and my Grandkids at 5 and 6. I've always liked M. C. Escher, it's really cool to see a game based on his perspective bending art. The ethereal music is a perfect fit to the game. The story line is also interesting with its focus on redemption.

kind, scratching, This game actually made me smile because of its inventiveness, but don't expect a head-scratching kind of puzzler; this is more like an endearing journey with puzzle mechanics. But it's cool.

fan, long, Is it art or is it a game? Well, its actually both. I'm an audiophile who loves puzzles and a life long fan of Escher. Someone actually made a game for me! I think the ONLY thing I would change is the icon. It really doesn't give any clue to the amazement that lurks within. I passed the game by a few times as the icon looked kinda dull. Amazing game deserves an amazingly instantly recognizable brand icon! One of the best games I've ever played, ever! 10/10

game, great, This is a great game, but unfortunately, as someone with experience with non-euclidean and perspective based puzzle games (Portal, Superliminal, and Light Matter) the majority of the levels were very easy. With the exception of the final level in both the base game and paid DLC, and the Citadel of Deceit (which I particularly enjoyed), no other levels felt even remotely challenging

leves, first, Visually the game is quite beutifull, but in terms of gameplay the game is to easy which makes the game boring very fast. Lastly, with only 10/12 levels the game is to short specially when the first 3 leves are tutorials.
game, enchanting, What an enchanting puzzle game! The artistry and environment is wonderful and the gameplay and the puzzles are genius. Not too hard but not too easy. Good for all ages! Well done! Honestly, I wouldn't have tried it if it weren't for Google Play Pass but is still worth the money!

game, beautiful, This is a truly beautiful and ingenious game. The narrative is simple but warm. Some of the levels can be a little linear but they're so well designed it's hard not to appreciate. Its simple yet vibrant aesthetic and mind bending architecture bring the world to life. I just wish there was more of it. Edit: There's now more of it 5*

It was easy at first then it got more challenging. I have no idea how my mind figures the puzzle when I was about to give up...then üí• üí• üí• conscious took over and the puzzle connected for that level.

game, beautiful, What a beautiful game. Simple, yet satisfying. No whiz, bang, booms, just a peaceful setting that makes you think and notice how things are put together to reach a goal. There aren't instructions, yet even I figured out how it works. Absolutely the best game I've played. MORE PLEASE.

example, amazing, Beautiful, fun, calming, sometimes emotional. An amazing example of how great a mobile game can be. I've almost finished the Forgotten Shores expansion, will probably get Ida's dream too. Only found 1 bug so far, in the Waterfall level.

game, beautiful, Arguably the most beautiful game on the phone platform. The appendix part is very good too!
game, Beautiful, Beautiful and challenging game.
chance, little, The puzzle solutions were too easy (kind of railroaded to the solution, there was little chance of getting stuck or confused), and the game was far too short; but the graphics, story, and soundscape made the game worth playing (and replaying at least once, maybe more).
gem, absolute, This game is an absolute gem. Great story line graphics and atmospheric sounds. Proper brain training and probably one of the best mobile games out there. The developers are super intelligent creating this game.

level, more, Not worth it. Levels are too few. You have to purchase to add more level. It sucks
connections, new, Puzzles are pretty easy. Mostly all turning of objects in your mind to see new connections. Some remembering of how to use optical illusions to your advantage. I enjoy this sort of thing for casual entertainment.

game, main, Really enjoyed this - very relaxing and clever, though if you are used to puzzle games of any sort you'll find this far too easy. Only gets 5 stars for the add on pack which is an extra ¬£1.50. The main game on it's own is good but it's short and finishes just as it seems to be going somewhere interesting. The add on is much more interesting, to me anyway. What there is of the 'story' is pretentious nonsense!

time, same, So beautiful. Loved how it made me think. Almost cried over the totem. Relaxing at the same time it is engaging.
happiness, pure, This game is a pure happiness and joy for those who love geometry, thinking outside the box, beautiful visuals and fantasy.

game, boring, Brilliant. Definitely very challenging and keeps you thinking, so if you don't want a boring game this is not boring. Might drive you nuts sometimes due to the complex puzzles, but it's worth continuing to the end to see the outcomes & the gorgeous graphics (the optical illusion artist M.C. Escher would love both games if he were still alive) and colors. I am going to post the next game, now.

puzzles, intricate, Level 8 was interesting and beautiful. I would have liked to see more intricate puzzles like this. Most of the game I was bored.
years, few, I got this game when it was free a few years ago. I decided to play it now, and it's been one of the best mobile games I've ever played. From the graphics, to the way the puzzles are, this game is amazing. It may be short, but I'd say it's worth the price. 10/10 I'm going to buy the sequel.

hours, several, Basically this game is more than awesome. The graphics are wonderful and the story too. BUT... buying this game for that price I imagined several hours of gaming. But you can finish this game pretty fast.
game, great, It is a great game but when you are finished and bored with it it is sad that you can't get your money back though
game, amazing, What an amazing, beautifully devolped game. Levels are a simple masterpiece. Very MC Escher like vibe throughout the game. Music is ever so calming. I wish there hundreds of levels. Definitely worth the small price. Amazing.

game, Unique, Unique, amazing, and fun game. Only issue really was that the controls were little wonky when using the spinners for platforms, or whole puzzle, etc. Would over shoot or under shoot there objective point a lot. Hopefully we will see a monument 3 or something similar soon.

game, entertaining, I played this game once before when it was free and once I found it again this year, I knew I had to play it again. I remembered it being so beautiful and unique in its story and mechanics. I certainly remembered it correctly because it blew me away all over again. I think everyone should give this entertaining puzzle game a try because it's 100% worth it.
fun, Good, Good fun but over way too soon even with the extra level pack added. The puzzles aren't too taxing but do make you think and challenge spacial awareness a little. Beautiful graphics and a soothing soundtrack slightly let down by those pesky crowsüòÜ

game, bad, The game is absolutely gorgeous, relaxing and mesmerising, all of that is true. That being said, it offers close to no challenge and is rather short. It is not a bad game but it is more of an experience than it is a game in the strictest sense of the term. As long as you're aware of what you're buying you'll probably have a good time with it though.

I would recommend it for anyone looking for laid back puzzles and a cool non-euclidean game design despite the downsides. Not worth the price to me but I don't regret the purchase either.

game, amazing, This is an exceptionally amazing game! The solutions to the puzzles seem impossible at first, but are so seeming right there as you walk your path and manipulate the path to different view points. How some of them came together had me say "Wow, that's amazing!" on more than one occasion. This game makes your brain have to think outside of the box. One of the greatest games I've ever played. Will absolutely be looking at the developer's other titles. Brilliantly done guys and gals!

The solutions to the puzzles seem impossible at first, but are so seeming right there as you walk your path and manipulate the path to different view points. How some of them came together had me say "Wow, that's amazing!" on more than one occasion. This game makes your brain have to think outside of the box. One of the greatest games I've ever played. Will absolutely be looking at the developer's other titles. Brilliantly done guys and gals!
puzzles, solving, I am delighted with this game. I got to wander in a world like that created by Escher solving puzzles that would make my eyes cross. I really like the game.
illusion, optical, By far the best optical illusion game I've ever played. Edit: To those people who rated this game 1 star because they had to pay money to play, it's a premium game. Most good games are pay to play. This is a great game, and if you have to pay, just pay. It's 5 bucks and you get what you pay for. It cost extra to play new levels because they updated it, just like how you still have to pay for DLC's, even if you already bought the game. You're paying extra, for additional content.

game, whole, I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME! It was extremely challenging for me because I tend not to pay attention like I should. Some of the solutions made me groan because I spent so long ignoring the obvious. I went through the whole game in less than a week and am currently downloading the second! Keep it coming!

game, Beautiful, Beautiful game on all levels - graphics, colors and sound. I like princess interaction with crows! The game was very meditative and overall it was like a gasp of crispy fresh air in oasis after long travel through the desert. The 19th level gave me run for the money, I even restarted the level, because thought I have missed something. Lol About some people complaints about price - it's much cheaper what you spend to go to movie theater to find out that movie was crappy. Thank you for the game!

content, enough, Having played, I would say there's enough content for maybe $2. More like $1.50. However, the music and interactions are quite enjoyable, and I do wish there was more for less $!!
day, long, Very relaxing, almost therapeutic. And I like how it engages my brain especially after a long day of brain dead job.

game, sweet, Clean, thoughtful and sacred. This is a sweet little game with a bit of general spirituality to it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and think the developers made this through a labor of love. Really well made, and part 2 is just as good, if not better. Thanks for making this game!
