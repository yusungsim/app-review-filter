stuck, on, puzzle, Great game but stuck on 'signal' puzzle as only flashes my light once so cannot complete.
open, on, s, Currently game refuses to open on my Galaxy s 21, when opening, immediately crashes, but overall until it started doing that, I love the game! :)
played, on, platform, Hands down, one of the best puzzle games I ever played on any platform.
playing, on, top, Sigh. At least one colour puzzle, and an audio puzzle with music playing on top of the morse code. Not everyone has the greatest eyesight nor the greatest hearing. Good idea, not the best execution. Fix the spelling errors too. I didn't finish the game due to the above issues.

looked, like, game, I was hesitant to play this game because it looked like a kids game but it definitely isn't. I definitely had a hard time with some puzzles. I think the addition of some sort of hint system would be beneficial. Having to watch the walkthrough videos on YouTube is horrible.

challenging, At, times, A true smart phone game. At times the puzzles were challenging, but it was super enjoyable.
remindes, of, doki, It was.. great you managed to do A Team Salvato the 4th wall breaking and coding stuff remindes me of doki doki,

think, outside, puzzle, Fun unique point click puzzle game I loved the story it was fun the puzzles were both fun think outside the box puzzle and sometimes random click around to figure it out puzzles. I enjoyed this experience!!
stuck, at, sections, This game surprised me. Highly recommend to play if you like escape games. Not hard but not too easy. Definitely got stuck at certain sections. Short but memorable and fun. Go check it out!
enters, into, stage, I really enjoyed the beginning but found myself frustrated after it enters into the new stage where the game is similar to a very popular game for PC. I almost wish it would of just stayed a clever whodunit but it changes rapidly. I found myself stuck on a specific part where you must charge your phone but it wasn't recognizing me charging my phone? Lol I still can't figure out what happened but I just gave up because too much hassle. I would of loved to see a good ole mystery.

uninstall, from, frustration, Cute game but no hints, so if you're stuck that's it. Had to uninstall from frustration
looking, at, reviews, Do it. Play this game. I wouldn't know where to begin telling you how good this is. Just friggin play it already if you're looking at the reviews. You want a game like this. Need a game like this. :)
seem, at, first, My favorite escape room game! It may seem generic at first and glitchy af but keep playing it through. There are different endings: good and bad. Walkthroughs may ruin your experience so just keep trying. Pay attention to small details and have great memory. Good luck!

seeming, like, game, Wow. Without giving too much away, this game definitely takes a turn. From what started as seeming like a game for kids quickly turned into a challenging, world-bending, adventure. I feel as though Mimo actually exists, and you made me feel terrible for wanting to play it again ðŸ˜‚ I know that sounds crazy, but trust me, just play the game.

put, at, times, I absolutely loved this game. Some of the puzzles were actually pretty tough and it was really hard to put down at times! The best part of the game for me was how... life-like it gets. Kudos to the developers, seriously! The only issue I encountered was some of the dialogue being cut off in the English version, but it didn't effect gameplay at all really so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

Wait, for, it, Wait for it...
gets, to, code, Game was awesome, very interactive until it gets to Morse code. I have hearing issues and couldn't hear with all the noises in the background. So can not move forward, until then it was great.

cut, in, translation, Lots of words cut off in translation, but I don't think it made a difference as the game is well translated. I found the controls a bit lacking (had to touch things multiple times for it to register), but fun and interesting game. I really hope you add a feature to save puzzle progress when you leave the puzzle and add a button to reset the puzzle instead of resetting the puzzle when leaving it!!
played, in, time, I haven't played a game like this in a long time. Once I finished I just sat there thinking and self reflecting. This game is beautiful and has a deep meaning. It's more than just a cute cat game. Probably the best mobile game I have played. Highly recommended.
need, for, clue, I was loving this game, but as I'm deaf i can't play some of the puzzles and takes a while to realise its the sound you need for a clue. Ive looked at walkthroughs but its not working on the computer morse code sequence? Not sure if the code is randomised?? Could you make it vibrate at least?? It was a great game otherwise, but now i can't progress.

think, outside, box, The story was amazing. The puzzle challenging, you definitely have to think outside the box for some of them. I cannot recommend this game enough, it was amazing!

going, in, places, Well that was surprising. Lots of out of the box puzzles. Definitely fun, and lots of unique puzzles. A few translation issues, mostly grammatical and the text going out of bounds in a few places but nothing that didn't hinder my progress. Definitely recommend.
saw, in, one, Very unique game! I really enjoyed this game. Some of the puzzles were difficult but not impossible. I saw in one of the reviews that they thought the game glitched but it's actually part of the game. I enjoyed it. I hope to play another like it.

asking, for, permissions, Very unique game. It starts out pretty standard adventure puzzle style, and starts integrating more real world as it goes. It gets difficult and no hints. The only real problem for me is that it says no permissions required, but does end up using your camera flash and asking for permissions while playing, though I don't know if any of the prompts grant real permissions or not. But well worth it either way imo. Very well done and entertaining but make the whole playthrough count, it's all u get.
had, with, game, This game is so rad. I can't even remember the last time I had so much fun with a game on my phone. maybe never? you have to play it.
love, outside, box, No spoilers but I love these outside the box and game games. Really good puzzles not too hard but gets you thinking. Well done

returns, to, window, Was really enjoying this game. I cannot progress beyond fixing the 2nd main frame as the return arrow is too close to the last light which has to change colour. When I tap to change the colour the arrow is activated and returns me to the previous window. Very frustrating. Any suggestions?
make, like, this, Really awesome game. Please make more like this!!
playing, on, note, An app game that knows how to app It was short but really enjoyable experience. I thought the puzzle solutions towards the end were awesome. I did have an issue of text getting cut off, usually a word or 2. I'm playing on a Samsung note 9 in English.
Seems, like, game, Seems like a nice game, but English translation texts are cut short in my app and don't fit to the text boxes, so some of the texts are always missing, which makes you miss information and plot. I am playing with OnePlus 3T, Android 9.

gets, in, way, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! No spoilers, but let's just say the game gets a little "sus" (in the best way). It's a fantastic point-and-click puzzle game with excellent artwork, an original story, and unique, original puzzles (which is very impressive for a point-and-click). The difficulty can be pretty challenging, though it's mostly fair without relying on nonsensical "point-and-click logic" for what items get used where. There aren't any hints, but App Unwrapper has a helpful walkthrough on YouTube.

got, into, vault, The game was fun while I was able to play. I got into the bank vault and was unable to give the picture to the police cat to prove that the cat-burgaler had been in the vault. Once I realized the game had a bug, I tried to reset. It reset. All of it, including the language. I am unable to read the language that the game is now in. I can't figure out how to change the language. I uninstalled. Makes me sad, seemed like a good game, I would have enjoyed finishing the story line.

sucked, into, world, An amazing game that sucked me into its world from beginning to end. I fell in love with its charming art, intriguing story, and excellent puzzles. Simply a-meow-zing!

wasted, on, this, Such a weird frustrating game. Can't figure out how to get all of the achievements. Can't even start over. Contacted developer and that didn't even help. I want to be able to start the game over. I wasted $3 on this. I should get my money returned.
think, outside, box, Brilliant - definitely one of the best puzzle games yet this year - you really have to think outside the box and thanks to Appunwrapper for the walkthroughs! More please!
