returning, to, it, I love this game and keep returning to it to grow my towns
invested, in, game, Genuinely didn't think I'd be as invested in the game as I am. It's simple and fun
comparing, to, games, Loading time over a minute on a flagman phone is killing. No new gameplay mechanics comparing to similar games
lying, around, ground, You build a town for adventures, you give said adventures 100 bananas (individually) to make them stronger, and then a banana monster defeats 75% of your adventurers anyway. Thankfully defeat for an adventurer in this game involves them lying around the ground for about a minute until they get back up. I give this game 5 hats out of 5.

changed, in, years, Overall a fun town builder game. It would be perfect but there are just so many event popups in the game that it ruins the flow. Also the interface hasn't changed in years for games from this dev. I get it is their style but some ergonomic improvements would make their games A+.

running, in, background, Save frequently. if you leave the game running in the background it can black screen and you may lose progress
optimized, like, champ, Excellent mobile game, optimized like a champ. No nonsense. No pay to win.
supporting, for, years, I LOVE Kairosoft and have been supporting them for several years now. The games always make me happy and an easy way to kill time. They are simple to play with just enough challenge to either make you work a bit harder to achieve the rankings inside the game. Dungeon Village 2 is amazing!!! Adored the first one but this one gives you so much more from farming, monster tamers, outside visitors that you get from cart/balloon/ship, monstera to fight while still keeping original characters.

Played, through, map, Played through the first map. Really like this game!
playing, for, bit, Fun little adventure sim. Great time killer. However, it crashes my phone after playing for a bit. Hope they fix this soon.
engrossing, with, progression, Cute and engrossing, with steady progression. It does drain the battery pretty badly, though.
made, to, original, Honestly great game, made improvements to the original, logged in 20+ hours in just a week, think I'm addicted...

doing, for, adventurers, Definitely a fun town simulator. Would love to have some more ingame help to see what stats are doing for adventurers and facilities, but it's great even without it.
plays, like, game, It plays like an actual game, like the ones that were played before pay to win was a thing. It's incredibly smooth and engaging.

load, for, me, So uhh... The game doesn't load for me. Not sure if it's my os or the game, but I've reinstalled 3 times, restarted my device a few, left the game for a few weeks, and nothing really seemed to work. GUI loads.. I think? Again I don't know because the game didn't load properly. Not really sure how to fix so help would be nice :)

put, into, experience, This is by far one of the best mobile games I've ever played. It brings so much joy to me to see all of the little things the developers put into this experience. So much content then what meets the eye. I will definitely try out other games from the same developer in the future. Thank you so much for an awesome game Kairosoft!

immersed, in, game, Cannot complain, I was actually immersed in the game. Towards the end of it everything just sped up and I started going through all ranks and all facilities upgrade. Slow to fast past love it!

go, with, kairosoft, Had a lot of fun building up my favorite characters and had plenty of options for them. Can't go wrong with kairosoft.
clicked, on, times, Great game, really deep, loads to do. There are a lot of 'hey, you did a thing!' pop ups that have to be clicked on multiple times and it can get slightly annoying, but it's still a great game and totally warrants 5 stars
asked, As, bonus, Fun fantasy town sim/idle game. Place buildings and decorations to make youe town turn a profit and lure in more adventurers that you can eventually move in. Worth the price imo, as it avoids the pay to win/proceed scheme many similar free games use. As a bonus it only asked for the rating very far in gameplay wise so it didnt feel like an annoyance. If you like these types of games I highly recommend it.

give, for, reason, The game is that great that you lose track of time..it's a money well spent..there is one thing that kinda bugs me..when i give items to a character for the reason that it is the best for it..after some time it will buy a crappie one...hope it just sticks to the one that i give or at least buy a much better one...all and all i love the game i hope there is a part 3...

glue, to, screen, Very fun and engaging, it can easily glue you to the screen for hours. There's a lot of depth and a nice variety in features. Well worth the pricetag!

get, to, end, Fun little game to spend time on when you have a few minutes free. You get to the end pretty quickly, wish it tookore to get to the "end" of the game.

mixes, into, blend, This game mixes so many different variables into a beautiful blend of gameplay. I love the city building aspect. Just watching your little adventurers walk around is fun. The only reason I rate for stars is like everyone else says, too many pop ups! They interrupt the gameplay so much because it freezes each pop up, and lemme tell you there are plenty lol. Other than that this game is the perfect grinding, crafting, building mobile game I've been looking for! Well worth the money, BUY IT!!

give, without, question, Game is fantastic but the amount of information pop ups is extremely frustrating. Would give 5 stars without question if this could be turned off.
turn, of, popups, Fun game but very short like more of the kairosoft games but no ads! Maybe only give us options to turn of certain popups because they are very anoying sometimes.
playing, for, days, Way more content than I expected, super fun, been playing it for days straight and really enjoying it. I appreciate there being no ads or microtransactions as I'm a compulsive spender. I'm definitely going to buy kairosoft games in the future since I can trust their quality games (and to avoid temptations of microtransactions in their f2p games :) )

played, in, while, Charming enough... Okay, okay, it's the best Kairosoft game I've played in a while.
get, to, stars, It felt really short to get to five stars, but was really addictive I binged it
play, without, ads, Great games, so nice to play an addictive game without the damn ads every 2 minites
does, with, progression, Honestly a good second game kinda the same concept but they definitely added more and for sure I know the first one has freemium but this is definitely worth the low cost that it is. Hours worth of game play at your fingertips and honestly takes days to beat even playing non-stop, game honestly does well with its progression and honestly if you find it at all challenging push through as your second playthrough you'll whiz through it with ease, still takes days to beat and has replay value!!

pass, with, Game, Omg. This game is not just gameplay addictive..its simple, cute and deep. Once u start u can't. Put down. No micro-transcation and hours just pass by with this Game
looking, for, something, I have been looking for something similar to the first Dungeon Village game. I was quite surprised and happy to see this. Played through once, it definitely does not disappoint.
appreciated, on, off, Pretty good. I enjoyed playing it. Although the near constant pop-up notifications disrupt the flow of the game. An option to toggle that on/off would be appreciated.
feel, near, end, Ok, whoa. Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I have. The game doesn't ask you to rate it till youve reached a 5 star town, so I've already played quite a bit. And it's QUITE addicting. There's plenty of depth in the simplicity of all the systems. There is so much charm and polish. And near the end of the game where I'm at right now i feel very challenged and engaged. The game is good. 5 star. Thank You.
spending, on, transcations, It's like a dumbed down version of the original. You're better off playing the first and spending $8 on micro transcations
played, in, time, This is one of the most addictive mobile games I've ever played in a very long time. The progression, classes, adorable monsters! I love it.
start, with, one, Its a fun game, definately better than the first, however beginners should start with the first one.
recommended, for, tag, A very simple charming city builder with fun RPG elements. Highly recommended for this price tag.
win, with, characters, Love it. No ads no pay to win just a fun city managment game with great characters
did, in, game, Kairosoft is easily the best mobile developer out there. Their games strike this perfect balance of fun and engaging gameplay that's easy to learn but hard to master. I loved the first Dungeon Village and this game is very much the same but they turned everything up to 11... more jobs to learn, more streamlined gameplay, more depth to basically everything they did in the first game, and to top it off, they give you a bunch of new zones where you can take a handful of your best fighters to start a new town but with everything you've already unlocked. It's almost like a new game + but within the same save file. It really extends the longevity of the game considerably, and they still add tons of new things to unlock. I'm rather shocked by the depth of this game and how much value you get for your money. My only gripe might be that some of the animations for performing actions, like setting up a quest or handing out medals at the end of the year get kind of tedious and would be a lot nicer if you could unlock an option to speed them up or just turn some popups up altogether. Can't complain too much though. Get this game. It's damn near perfect.

lacking, on, lists, Game is fun and addicting. Info parsing options in game are lacking though (no real filter + search + sort on long lists)
spent, on, it, Fun little manager, spent hours on it. Better yet, no ads or pay to win nonsense
spent, on, game, A rare occasion I'm happy to have spent money on a mobile game.
put, into, game, An excellent time sink. The more you put into the game, the more you will get out of it.
engaging, in, game, Great little strategy game simple yet engaging and best of all no spending real money in game to enjoy it or move forward!
hidden, behind, simple, Deceptively complex and engaging game, hidden behind a simple and easy to use interface and cute graphics.
stands, for, quality, Always enjoy Kairosoft's games but this one stands out for quality, interactivity, and choosing how to do things
has, with, games, Always has fun killing time with their games. Few new things added from last game. Keeps it fresh.

sucked, for, hours, Don't normally but glad I did, get sucked in for hours playing the game so I would say definitely worth the buy
expect, from, Kairosoft, Great game, wouldn't expect anything less from Kairosoft. Better than the first version because it includes multiple towns and extends beyond the previous time limit. Well done!

sit, with, application, Enjoyable, long progression however there is a lack of a speed-up button from the get go. There are many pockets of times where you simply have to sit with the application open or constantly have to press and hold to speed up dialogue or events. The save feature is the most frustrating-- you can lose many in game days of progress. If you decide to get this game, be sure to save in a spot you don't mind repeating the last few in game days.

check, on, it, Not bad... I think I'll enjoy it more if I didn't have to constantly check on it. 50% of the game is pop-ups, notifying you of ingame stuff. Really annoying. It feels like a clicker game just to get through it so the game can continue.

hope, on, mobile, If you like Sim games, then Kairosoft games are the best you can hope for on mobile. Well balanced, fun, and time consuming, Dungeon Village 2 is worth every penny.
gotten, in, while, I have not gotten a kairosoft game in a while as they started to be less fun. However this game scratches all the old Kairosoft itches for me.
playing, through, day, Well worth the price. I have had a lot of fun playing this randomly through my day. Some notifications can be annoying though.
want, from, game, Simple, fun, relaxing. What can one want more from a game!
keep, in, mind, Fun game. It does offer an in game reward for writing a review so keep that in mind.
play, in, time, It's a really fun, cute little game too play in spare time. It's just a kick back and chill kind-of game. I really love it.
spent, in, total, Fun mindless somewhat ocd pleasing have spent 30+ hours in total
sink, into, that, This is a great game that you can sink lots of time into. You pay once then never again. No in game adds, no microtransactions. They are a bit heavy on ai notifs but it is worth it.
Looking, to, releases, Love it! Looking forward to more releases from the studio
reinstall, after, months, I had to reinstall the game after several months of playing, for a paid game, not being able to recover data in the same device is really a big concern

seen, For, example, Pretty interesting game! The interface could be improved. For example, the display of traits provided by events or items can only be seen one by one.
Love, to, pieces, Love it to pieces!
put, into, game, I've enjoyed all the time I've put into into this game.
get, like, game, Really like this game, you get to make it your own and build up your town and no in app purchases or ads. Also you get cool monster friends along the way!

do, than, one, Hooked much more to do than the 1st one
feels, like, game, I truly don't get the high rating if this game, this one is so dull I can't believe I paid for it! It feels like an idle game to me, not my thing.
gotten, to, stars, Really fun offline game. I wish that the UI used less popups as it can get a little busy, but overall its a great game! I've gotten to 5 stars on the first town and am now moving on to the next one, I'm glad there's a progression to the game. Worth the $ too, as theres no ads and the gameplay is smooth.

pays, in, end, This game rocks, it's a lot of work. But it pays off in the end. Keep it up!
Turns, to, game, Turns out the trick to a great idle game is no micro transactions. A lovely game that can mostly run in the background, although some of the dialog is hard to skip and repeating, it's overall a lot of fun.

makes, for, time, So fun! Definitely worth checking out as it makes for a calm and fun time.
reminded, of, game, Time consuming. It reminded of old school city building game. Its not to expensive. If say try it
play, for, hours, Kairosoft does it again! It's a casual game, but requires strategy. I can play it for hours!
played, in, background, Pretty good game, it has a lot of interruptions that i wish played more in the background though. Also wish editing the town was easier like adding a sort of building storage or something
help, along, way, Better than the 1st game. No ads, no waiting, just a great city building game with adventurers to help along their way.
competing, with, yourself, Addictive, but you can sit it down and enjoy life. You're competing with yourself, so there's no rush. I'm on the 3rd town, with 5* across so far. Very casual and fun. I enjoy just letting it run and watching them grind. Looking forward to DV3 or added content here.

pick, during, break, Easy to pick up during my lunch break. Fun to play too!
try, from, company, Really cute! I enjoyed this a lot. Definitely going to try more from the same company.
take, on, style, Interesting take on the tycoon type game style. It's sucked me in, even though i don't usually get into these games too easily. It's just one of those games that's really well made, but doesn't have a lot of info readily available online, so doing well in the game is entirely up to you.

It's just one of those games that's really well made, but doesn't have a lot of info readily available online, so doing well in the game is entirely up to you.
recommended, for, People, Amazing good fun for 5 bucks. And i havent close to finish my first town! And there are even more towns to do. Highly recommended for People Who like management in some form.
get, for, money, I've had a blast with the game. Super clean game. Worth buying for sure. Beats p2w any day. Plus, for as cheap as the game is, you'll get way more for your money in this game than anything else.

stuck, on, it, Ok this game has me hands down. No pay to win AT ALL. Great dang game. I am stuck on it every chance I get.
pick, for, bit, It's a good game worth the money easy to pick up for just a little bit or to get caught up in for a few hours. 9/10 for a phone game.

add, to, buildings, I wish they would add unique upgrades to buildings, or the old tile combo system. Perhaps 2 buildings of the same type becoming an upgraded version. The items feel a little excessive and the population popup gets annoying, population doesn't have any value than upgrade requirements. Perhaps farmland needs a buff. Also the second town expansion should come a bit earlier, I was sitting with a cramped town for a long time. The titles are nice, wish they had more purpose like a merging system.

did, with, one, They really did a nice job with this one. Sticking to the original reason why these games are fun with enough additions that made it more enjoyable. I loved the first one but this one is even better.

Got, to, stars, Really fun, been binge playing it. Got my first town to five stars and working on the second. Monsters have really silly and playful dialog and it is micromanage heaven. No p2w, p2c, or anything pay related except begging villagers for gold and buying the game itself.

is, to, notification, The game itself is really good, I could give 5, but there is to many achievements notification it's kind annoys and makes me a bit tired when playing. I wish you make another dungeon village sequel with less notification like this one. Overall this is a great game
send, on, quests, Brilliant, great fun to pass the time. Manage a village full of adventurers, send them on quests, upgrade your shops. So much variation. And no micro transactions or subscriptions.
played, on, iOS, One of the best RPGs I've played on iOS just wish I could control characters directly other than that the game is at 10 out of 10!
kept, with, more, A great improvement on dungeon village one, all the fun kept with more to do
invested, in, game, Honestly didn't think I was too invested in the game, but then there were several occasions where I would play it for actual hours and not even realize. Definitely worth the money.

Reminds, of, gameplay, Reminds me of old Super Nintendo gameplay. The game-pausing popups are part of the nostalgia! Really enjoy this!
switch, between, phone, Fantastic game. Wish the saleable could be easily located and transfered so I could switch between phone and tablet. Worth every penny
defeat, in, way, Nice game, happy to see a sequel to Dungeon Village, but first boss is impossible to beat first time. If intentional, this is bad game design, as there is no telegraphing of this and you get punished for not being able to beat him. If not, this is still bad game design as he is too hard to defeat in any reasonable way, being able to wipe you even if you send literally everything you have.
spend, on, app, another great Kairosoft game! Just about the best money you can spend on an app.
tapping, through, them, The constant popups are actually a problem. Prepare to waste hours tapping through them. Otherwise great game.
play, from, creators, Like most kairosoft games it's fun and easy to play. They price games well and it's just so much better than trying to play an ad infested game from other creators.
play, with, maps, This game was and is so addicting and I can play forever with different maps and worlds and ppl I don't think it ever stops but it's very fulfilling And fun and lots and lots of equipment and items and things to unlock. When you think you beat the game, you are maybe only 1 percent done

playing, for, while, Super fun! I'm sure I'm going to keep playing this for quite a while.
get, at, times, Very charming and fun town management/rpg game. The popups do get a bit annoying at times which is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars... Worth a buy, solid game!
clicking, After, village, Gets repetitive and boring real fast. After the first village most of your playtime is repeatedly clicking through 5 window pop-ups.

agreed, with, it, Love this game but, I've seen other's comment on how to improve this game and I kinda agreed with it. Maybe do it for the dungeon village 3 in case you guys gonna make it (please make it, dungeon village series is the best one you got for now)... Also, the most importantly, make a button of "buy all" or select the number of things we wanna buy in store, it's annoying to buy it one by one...

drop, within, day, To be honest, I thought I'd get bored and drop it within the first day. But the end, it was enough to draw me in and satiate. I just cleared the five star mark and will probably stop now, but what it does give you isn't bad for what it is.
Loved, as, kid, Loved this game as a kid, and still love the sequel. Thank you Kairosoft.
waiting, for, something, Fun time sink when your waiting around for something.
figure, at, first, It was hard to figure out at first but once i did it was really fun. I couldnt put it down. I just reached 5 stars in my town im not sure if the game continues or not but im looking forward to finding out.

working, towards, title, Pretty fun game overall. Takes a little getting used to to navigate the menus. Wish there was an easier way to see how you're doing on working towards a new title or way to tag your own goal. Overall fun little game though
operated, like, this, Excellent little town builder rpg. Lots of things to keep you busy. Takes some strategy to keep your towns gold balance where it should be, which is a good thing. I wish more mobile games operated like this.
entertaining, for, hours, solid, entertaining for several hours, characters are imaginative
stuck, in, middle, Fun the first day, but then gets very repetitive and boring. Too many pop ups all the time. One of the characters got stuck in the middle of the road and couldnt move for the rest of the game. Also, if you switch to another app and switch back, you'll get a black screen and have to restart your game without being able to save.

play, with, mechanics, This game is honestly addicting. No micro transactions no BS. Just play the game with the mechanics the devs designed. Love this game.
compared, to, village, Really easy game compared to dungeon village 1. Haven't mastered half the jobs yet and beat the game. It's fun. Try it out.
love, for, dollars, Very fun game! I love that for just a few dollars you can have constant play. And you can just keep growing!
see, with, ECT, I was convinced that this was going to be a bad experience because my town was always in debt but it quickly became a game I simply couldn't put down. It continuously became more and more enjoyable. With no cash shop! Absolutely amazing experience. Would love to see some quality of life with the town management ECT. And some better menu navigation would make this a very chill game.
built, upon, success, Enjoyed the first game and this one built upon that success. Quite enjoyable as all Kairosoft games have been that I've played
stuck, in, loops, Overall a great game and I'm loving it. I would say sometimes you get stuck in the notificafion/animation loops for what feels like days. Hope they add a feature to skip or supress some of it. Seeing the same message 500 times in two hours gets old. maybe move some of them to a mailbox system or add an option to skip join animations, maybe checkmarks to assign medals and the like.

added, since, version, They ask you to write a review after you've finished a gameplay cycle. It's fun, they've added a lot of content since the first version, which I also enjoyed. Definitely worth the price if you have a few people in your play family to share it with.
Look, to, games, Definitely a fun little game. Look forward to new games!
lying, on, Sofa, Absolute blast. Spent way too much time lying on the Sofa, micromanaging my town and watching my Adventurers move out. Its amazing
built, upon, first, Always a pleasure to play this game. First one was great and the second one just built upon the first. The pop ups are a tad annoying but not unbearable. Keep up the good work kairosoft!
beats, in, terms, I played the first one a lot and i was really excited to see that a second one was being developed. This game beats out the first in terms of content and replayability, this was definetly worth the few bucks.
start, after, work, Absolutely worth the money, I'd start this game after work and find myself playing for hours right in front of my yet to be turned on PS5. Keep making amazing quality games!

sucked, in, you, Pretty fun, surprising how sucked in you get.
purchased, without, thought, Dungeon Village was my first Kairosoft app, and I'm so happy to see a 2nd one has come out! Immediately purchased without a second thought, and haven't regretted it yet. Looks like Kairosoft is stepping away from the F2P zone, which I definitely support.
use, in, time, Fun app to use in idle time.
Builds, off, parts, Builds off the best parts of the first installment. It guess much deeper and incentivizes to post much longer than the first with more quests and slower boss reveals.
replace, with, weapon, Fun and worth the low price. The only complaint I have is the AI needs a bit of work, since physical characters will sometimes replace a good weapon they have with a magic boosting weapon, and vice versa.
designed, like, game, No ads, pay to win, or gambling mechanics. It is designed like a proper game. Progression is fun and you can develop a connection to individual characters. I did not give a 5-star for the following reasons: - Too many notifications! This has been said by other reviewers and I have to agree 100% Please listen and set most to just be the pop-up ones across the bottom. Some things notify you 3 times and its tiring when the game freezes every few seconds with information you have read 100s of times since the first year. - Menu organization. Facilities organization doesn't make sense there are stores under all categories. Under adventure, quests are the only adventure option the other presents and monsters should be an adventurer tab. There are so many other things on this but that was just a few of them. Just a few other points for Dungeon Village 3. Please make unique attributes for each adventurer. Make adventurers randomly generated and allow them to die if they aren't recovered from the field for a hardcore mode. Change the map for easy monsters close to town and harder monsters further away and make lairs stay on the map and replenish over time. Great working title keep it up!

having, with, game, Addicting, but no ads to be invasive. I'm having more fun with the $7 game right now then the $20 one I bought on pc
paid, for, it, Fantastic, i love how my adventures can get pet monsters and theres replay-ability. Once one town is maxed out, you can make a new town to expand your territory. I love it so much. Well worth the money i paid for it.
improves, on, original, Fun game. Definitely improves on the original
waste, on, phone, I've played a few Kairosoft games, but this is one has been my favorite so far. Plenty of content for such a cheap price, and no microtransactions. Just a fun way to waste time on your phone.
lost, in, world, Blissfully lost in this cute world.
had, as, pop, Its a good time waster. The only thing i dont like is the constant awards slowing everything down. If they had it as a little pop up that was translusant so i could read it and go on it would be better.

keeping, on, games, After quite some time of not keeping myself up to date on kairosoft games i still bought this without hesitation. 1. Because kairosoft. 2. Dungeon village part 2! This is such a huge upgrade from the first one. Tons of gameplay! It has different maps to explore while still keeping your progress. Jobs facilities adventurers still remain while there's new ones unlock on the next map. Overall it's another good one from kairosoft. Now I'm hoping to see Ninja Village 2!

living, in, it, This is a fun, interactive game to play when you get some downtime. It pauses when you leave the game so you always start off where you left things. I love how you can customize your town and the people living in it!
played, for, hours, Kairosoft are so good at strategy mobile games. This is another one that has me hooked! I was only disappointed to see the end game material operates slightly differently, however, it's a game that can be played for hours without too much stress or strain!

Seems, like, seconds, I loved this game as much as the first version. The reason I didn't give 5* is because there is an excessive amount of in-game notifications/messages that pop up. Seems like every 10 seconds a congratulations would come up on screen for a mundane task. I'd recommend for the developers to reduce these so you can actually play the game

lose, in, them, I have always loved Kairosoft's little rpg management games. There's always so much to do, classes and places to explore, and you can lose yourself in them for hours. They were starting to head to the horrible freemium/wi-fi connection format so many use, but thankfully it looks like they have abandoned the abomination of a platform. Stay awesome Kairosoft. I'll happily buy these little gems you make for $6-7 a pop.

gets, around, game, Hard at first then it gets easier all around fun game and you want stop playing it
's, in, purchases, So fare its been fun I've played 2 le els so fare but its a grate game in my book well worth the money love that there's no adds or in app purchases
wait, for, animations, Good game. The biggest flaw are the pop up dialogs. It pauses the game and forces you to wait for the animations and click through. Very annoying.
is, than, one, Love this game! There is more to do than the first one, so even more awesome!
Returning, to, gameplay, Great game! Returning to the old kairosoft gameplay is always the best. Good job dev team!
doing, by, 2nd, Animations seriously have to be skippable. At least by 2nd, 3rd city when you are already doing more or less the same thing it is sooo annoying watching everyone leave for a quest for 2000th time or using items or using the cauldron. Make it skippable in settings!!!

enjoyed, for, years, Another great hit from Kairosoft. I've enjoyed these games for years and I'm proud to be a fan.
play, without, thought, Kairosoft again, come a second version of Dungeon Village. One of my favourite. Bought n play without second thought. Another sleepless nights
lost, by, time, The startup loading is so long that by the time I'm halfway through I already lost interest in playing. A mobile game should not load for this long every single time

change, for, customization, This game is pretty cute honestly. I enjoy renaming but I do wish you could change their looks a bit for full customization along with chromas for costumes. Overall the same is great.

Spent, on, game, Spent more time on this game than I thought I would. Managing your own town and group of adventurers is fun!
deal, with, this, I have enjoyed playing this game, but if you don't like games that constantly make pop ups then you might not find it as enjoyable. Here's an example of what I mean provided you have a monster tamer : new dungeon, completed dungeon, [monster name] wants to join you, get a metal, [monster name] wants revenge, a new monster has appeared, [adventurer] want a house, [adventurer] house completed, and you have to deal with this every 30 seconds or so. Over all I have enjoyed playing this game.

Feels, like, progress, Another hit from Kairosoft. All the sim fun of their other games, with much more endgame content. Feels like progress
help, through, gameplay, Really fun game with a large playground. The progress system is well designed to help you through gameplay while learning about the game for the first time.

gets, without, much, Really good, gets repetitive without much being added by the 4th or 5th world. Still had a great time.
loved, about, one, I loved the first one. If you played it then you have to play this one. It has everything I loved about the first one but a million more things. A lot of people commented on on the number of pop up in game. There are a lot but that means you're doing well. The pop ups are tell you things that are going on. And there's alot going on. I just got my first 5 star town. If you've ever played a game like this and liked it then you'll love this game. It's worth every penny

addicted, to, game, I am thoroughly addicted to this game. I'm on my third town, and I won't stop until the game stops.
spent, on, game, Some of the best money I've spent on a mobile game. Very fun!
adding, to, it, Enamored.. Fun, adorable, and I hope they keeping adding on to it. 😍
bogged, with, amount, Fun game but really gets bogged down with the amount of pop-ups towards end game. Still a great time killer overall.
play, for, hours, Exactly as advertised. good game to play for a couple hours. fun management game with an old style RPG feel.
make, for, experience, Pretty fun, nice pixel classic that engages the player enough to make for a very good casual gaming experience.
dumping, into, something, Like the 1st but better. Solid buy. Only gripe is the the village trait system. If your dumping a bunch of resources into something you can trigger the a bunch of traits at once that'll spam your screen. Not game breaking but can get super annoying
spend, upon, hours, I absolutely love this game, I spend hours upon hours on it and it doesn't even get boring. Well worth the price. Much improved from the first dungeon village.

learn, about, mechanics, This game is a lot of fun. The first town doesn't have high stakes but it is still fun to play and to learn about the mechanics.
asks, for, review, Solid game, worth the rating even though it asks for a 5* review for an in-game reward. I'm giving it 5* anyway. Builds off everything that made the first one addictively fun, with more to do and build. Lots of pop-up notifications as you play, far more than the first, so be prepared for that. The addition of more worlds is a great touch!

like, like, Valley, This is a good game, but it needs tweaking to be a great mobile game. Less popups, improved GUI etc. However it is fun and enjoyable, in fact it was to quick to beat. The popups are too much need to be handled better. I would like to see a PC port, with longer game play; like stardew Valley and a longer more casual version for mobile. Game is designed well and has good mechanics, perfect for fun, just do not expect to put your phone down.

had, with, it, I've had fun with it. It's an interesting set up, different from most games out there, but still easy to figure out.
click, through, them, A Return to Form for Kairosoft! Really great entry in the Kairosoft franchise. I'm loving the game and only just finished the first town. I don't really understand the complaints about the frequent pop-ups. It's a little annoying, but you can quickly click through them. Typical for a Kairo game. Great work overall.
blown, like, first, Just like the first, Dungeon Village yet again has blown it out if the water, with adorable sprites and animations, and a surprisingly in-depth village-dungeoneering mechanic, this game will have you instantly hooked. Naming the heroes is pretty fun too, helps to identify high level heroes.
going, for, time, Fun game to sink your time into. It is complex enough to keep you going for a long time.
expect, from, addictive, So much fun! Everything you expect from kairosoft - addictive and value for money
put, with, summoner, The game is very engaging with a lot of different class options to work with. I personally like the monster companion engine. It's always nice to put a draggi with a summoner.
guessing, on, lot, Addicting, but some things could definitely use more info on how they work. Just guessing on a lot of things, which is fun in its own way
fixed, on, ️, they fixed the long load times on lg g7 ❤️❤️ thank you kairosoft
played, for, first, Have played both the for the first and this game and I just have to say, buy this. The first isn't bad, this one just cleans up every loose ends and roughed up bits. Nice cute visuals, and the gameplay is nice and easy
involved, for, hours, As always, this is a winning pairing or casual and tycoon game that still keeps you involved for hours on end.
put, Like, one, Fantastic sequel. Like the first one, can't put it down!
took, to, level, Where the last game fell short, this one took the game to a whole new level. Worth the money. Karisoft created a masterpiece here. Enjoy and keep on hunting fellow adventures!
spend, for, 5hr, Exciting,I spend my time for 5hr when I get lockdown at home. If you looking for interesting game this game is one choice.

get, on, end, Love kairosoft games, loved dungeon village 1... this one is no exception. Numerous cool new features to get you hooked for hours more on end than ever before. Definitely worth buying.

sleeping, for, night, I forgot sleeping for a night playing this game. I find it is challenging when the town reach 3 stars and above. Each year passes very quick and there are several things to plan and invest. I find this game is much relax since it no require combo, which sometime it really time consuming rather than just enjoy the game.

recommend, to, others, It took a little bit to get an understanding of it. However once you grasp it, then it become quite enjoyable. I would recommend it to others.
Increase, on, value, A solid update to the original. Mostly the same game, but with enough new activities to keep it interesting. Increase on replay value is a huge plus
have, from, fan, Nice ver. Hope next ver. have more feature as this one :) from this game fan.
displayed, for, milestones, Popup advice: remove the town point pop-ups and reward those points autonomously. The common complaint is that there are too many popups. This specific popup isn't needed. There's already a notification displayed for town point milestones. Removing these should fix the too many popups complaint in my opinion.

build, into, town, It's entertaining enough to buy. Fun to build up a little village into a booming town
look, without, pop, It's a solid upgrade from dungeon village 1, however once you get to around a 4 star village you can't even look away from your phone without a pop-up pausing your game to tell you something mundane, really frustrating after awhile.
took, for, while, Really fun Kairosoft game! Been a fan for years, took a break for a while, and so glad this was one of the first I tried when I came back.
Lasted, about, week, Had a good time. Lasted me about a week.
improves, in, way, Great game, improves the first in every way!
had, with, game, I cannot explain how much fun I had with this game. I'm a huge Kairosoft fan in general, but this one blew me away. Great work!
finished, with, 5stars, just finished my first town with 5stars there for this review is for 5stars. like all there games it's a simple concept and they expand on it further slow and steady love it 👏😊

improved, on, iteration, This game is fantastic! So much improved on the last iteration. Great job Kairosoft!! 😁
move, to, settlements, Fun time killing app, a lot of characters and the option to move to new settlements was a pleasant surprise.
looking, for, something, Amazing game been looking for something like this for a long time. Really fun game.

enjoy, during, map, Games is fun and addictive. I enjoy the most during the 1st map, subsequent map is relatively similar with added difficulties. A little expensive for a mobile app that last me 3 days.
spent, on, couch, Literally spent hours on the couch enjoying this game. So easy to play!
upgrade, from, version, So much to do! Much upgrade from the earlier version
brings, to, table, Simply phenomenal! This game brings a lot to the table and I have only just begun! Love the way each character can do multiple jobs and become stronger and stronger! I am still trying to figure out how to make my income positive instead of being in deficit most of the times, but I guess that's one of the beauty of the game: You are free to do as you wish! Build, destroy, rearrange and go out there and kill some monsters and raid some dungeons!
Picked, on, whim, Picked this up on a whim and it's absolutely addicting.
do, for, reading, Brilliant game I absolutely love it the first game was good to but this is it's supreme form love the dungeon village games this game is so fun so much to do thanks for reading!
gating, with, etc, Downloaded this one day out of boredom. Somehow became one of my favorite mobile games to date. Simple design and easy to grasp mechanics. No premium currency/time gating with building/objectives etc. Hands down 10/10 if you're into city or village building sims!
waiting, on, game, Totally worth the money. They add so many small details, if you've played their earlier games, you'll see the improvements on this one. I've always been a Kairosoft fan so definitely gonna be waiting on the next game with just as much, if not more, details on customization with the houses, characters, monsters and placement of things.

playing, in, intervals, Fun gameplay, but the popups from in-game events turn me off from playing the game in longer intervals.
gifting, to, adventurer, Fantastic sequel to DV1! The new tamable monsters, multiple towns, traits, jobs and cauldron upgrades are great! My only minus is the amount of "pop-ups" you get, especially after gifting lots of things to an adventurer. But its not bad enough for me personally, so still rating it 5*! Huge fan of Kairosoft games, played them all several times!
allow, to, notifications, Please allow us to disable notifications for popularity, medals and traits. So annoying
go, For, new, This is NOT a sequel to dungeon village, it's a remaster if the original. I loved the original and was excited new content but the first hour or so are almost identical. Exact same shops, minimal change to mechanics, even the items haven't changed. For those new to the franchise, definitely go for it, but if you wanted a different game to the original keep your money.

put, with, them, fun game. it's true the pop ups can be annoying however you learn to put up with them over time. Worth the money

going, after, that, Couldnt put it down had a set end point but you can keep going after that
loved, like, thanks, I've always been a huge fan of Ksoft games. I loved dungeon village 1 and really like Dv2 thanks for a good game at a rationale price
unwind, after, work, I have had a blast with this game! I didn't expect it to have the level of depth that it does. It's a great way to unwind after work.
Got, by, end, Well worth the few bucks to buy. Got five star village by the end of my second day playing, and think it would be fun to play it again. I see the validity of the complaints about pop-ups. One thing I would suggest is on the pop-up, add a small button to take you to the settings where you can choose to speed up the pop-ups and mute the sound on it.
