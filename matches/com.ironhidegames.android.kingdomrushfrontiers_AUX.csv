is, sequel, great, This, I love Kingdom Rush! This is a great sequel to the first one. Always enjoy playing this game!
's, games, most, that, good game, quite challenging but rewarding. that's most games on playstore missed out
is, game, second, This, KR series is one of the best tower defense mobile games I've ever played. This is the second game I purchased from KR series. Enjoying it so far, even tho some levels are quite a hassle and need a few attempts to complete it, but it's a nice experience overall.

is, entry, favourite, this, Long time fan and this is my favourite entry to the series
's, fun, simple, It, It's simple fun and just as enjoyable as the first game but the same problems remain. The scaling of difficult and gold gaining rate is a bit unfair
is, mountains, better, it, Although my least favourite of the series, it is still mountains better than any other game out there so gets that 5*
is, game, good, this, say no more.... this is f*in good game.... edit : come here again just want to say... this game still god damn good
is, way, best, which, One of the best tower defence games. I'm playing with Google play so it's all unlocked which is the best way to play.
be, one, free, it, I've played the free KR game & it's good, it would probably be the best free one, but still it has its issues in game play which became annoying. Frontiers is a big improvement on that game and the power ups are diverse and more intelligent. The hero's are still not great. The ones that come with the initial game are ok and will do. For more money, u unlock new hero's I don't see any major effect on the game play. They do different magic but they dont affect game play but cost you money. 4 / 5
's, complaint, only, that, Love the game. Not a fan of paying for it or for better heroes, but that's my only complaint. Awesome game.
is, one, first, this, Amazing i love the first 3 games and this is the first one i played it is the hardest one but it has so much to offer just wish there was another mini campaign

's, game, great, It, It's a great tower defense game, really unique and challenging gameplay

's, game, older, it, I bought Boneheart and I don't exactly regret it, however he needs to be changed a little with the ai, half the time he doesn't attack a target that's right under him or near him, just sits there. He uses the golems and the lane clear moves just fine but in terms of targeting the enemy, lacking. I know it's an older game but I love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è just please fix Boneheart is all I ask
's, lol, good, It, It's good lol
is, one, only, This, Fun as usual, the entire series is great. This is the only one I rated below 5 stars due to how hard it is. Much harder than the reat of the series, even on casual
's, game, previous, it, This game is seriously perfect. I loved playing through the levels and venturing through the different areas. Kingdom Rush Frontiers stayed true to it's previous game and perfectly added on to the previous game's story. It's good in alot of aspects, although I can say it can be a bit too challenging sometimes, even with easy mode. But not always. Oh and it's not pay to win, I do lose alot, but eventually you will get the right defense and beat the level. Just don't give up. Loving the music!
is, game, complex, This, The first game was great, and this one is even better. Don't let the simple graphics fool you. This is a surprisingly complex and strategic tower defense game.
is, game, nice, This, This is a nice cool game. Great time killer & not so fast gameplay. ^^ ü¶äüëç

're, fun, much, they, Been enjoying the kingdom rush games since I was a kid, keep coming back because they're so much fun and so well done
is, game, amazing, It, 4.5! It really is an amazing game with a cool storyline the only gripe is the later levels get really hard to get a 3 star on even then still a very fun game
's, game, good, it, Vet fun game loved it years ago coming ba k to it it's just as good very good game

's, game, good, It, It's a good game, used to play it with my father when in was 10 years Old. It's a shame thing they removed the Adobe flash player so now u have to pay for it, but im still glad it's on the market - 5 stars, totally deserved
's, game, best, it, Honestly it's the best mobile tower defense game and it's just very addicting
's, price, great, that, Been playing for quite a years since 2012,Iron hide never disappoint me, plus you could buy a hero for only $0.99, that's a great price.
's, thing, same, it, I enjoy the game but I think it's sort of the same thing as the original but slightly harder
is, games, best, This, This is the best strategy games I have ever played!
was, game, favorite, this, A long time ago when I was but a weed boy, this was my favorite game on armorgames. It has yet to fail me. Highly recommend. Fast paced tower defense with good comedic relief thrown in, sure to keep you entertained for awhile. Can't complain.
's, idea, neat, it, it's a neat idea to visit the beginning of this fun series built up with various tower defense concepts.
is, game, good, it, It would have been 4 stars because it is a good game but recently it just won't load it just cuts out after the enitial Ironhide advert! It wouldn't have bothered me if it was a free game but it wasn't.

's, fun, super, It, This game is awesome! It's super fun to play, its challenging, theres a lot of levels but sometimes the game gets to hard
is, game, best, This, This is the best tower defence game by far. Challenging, but not so much that you'll need to constantly buy premium stuff. Most upgrades are simply available by playing levels and you'll need to play some of them a few times until you get your strategy right to progress or access the bonus levels. 10/10
's, soooo, good, It, It's soooo good to play! Just you need to pay to buy the hero.. I'm just like what?! It's not to expensive..so I'm okay with that.. But to me it's so good to play since I have play classic kingdom rush! üëçüéâüòä
is, game, great, It, I played the free Kingdom rush and decided to try this. It is a great game; interesting towers and you now need multiple types to win. If without the Google play pass, certain heroes are locked...
is, game, honest, This, This is an honest-to-God great TD game, Would highly recommend trying it!

is, game, good, This, This is a good game, but the first, KR, has a better story line. Enjoy !
is, challenge, engaging, it, I honestly haven't found a game this good and consumer friendly as a phone app before. Most apps have either tons of ads or slow your progression to get you to buy boosters. This game does neither and I couldn't be happier with it, it is extremely fun, an engaging challenge, and has a good amount of content. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fun strategy games.
's, game, good, it, it's a good game but when i start buying new hero it started also to lose control in the game i wasted 10 bucks
's, time, great, It, It's a great passer time and really fun to replay and has a lot to do but personally a bit to much monitization.
