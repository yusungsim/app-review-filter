version, mobile, The mobile version is actually my preferred version because of how accessible clicking the character is instead of having to hold down a joystick as they slowly walk. wish the option was in other versions. love the zoom in and zoom out from the screen as well

phone, new, I absolutely love this game. Been playing for over a year and can't stop. I recently upgraded to a new phone and I'm having trouble switching over my current saved game to this new phone. Is there a way to do that? I really would hate to restart all over again when I was so far into 2 saved games.

game, fun, Picked this up out of boredom, lemme tell you, for the price, this is worth your money. It's a fun game you can play anywhere. Definitely recommend stardew valley

game, great, I think its a great game and i watch youtubers play it and i dont got the setting that they have but it still super great the way it is i play on a chrome os lap top and it still runs great
game, good, Overall a good game, but there is one thing that doesn't make sense to me. Turning crops of different quality into food makes no sense, when that food is all the same quality. I like to farm coffee beans then turn those beans into coffee before selling them, but it makes no sense turning higher quality beans into coffee when that coffee would just be the same price as a cup of coffee made with regular beans. Each quality crop should create food equal to the quality of the crop used.

devices, mobile, I love this game but I just really really want there to be a co op/multiplayer. I think it would be better too because all the people I know that play stardew Valley agree it should be co op on mobile devices.But I also don't get why they fix all the glitches because my brother just loves glitching games and stardew valley does not really matter because it is not a game like minecraft were its online with people.But it does not mean everyone cheats most don't.

platforms, multiple, After playing on multiple platforms and for over hours the game is phenomenal when it comes to goals, gameplay, and feeling of achievement. Great 2D graphics and well done mechanics made this my favorite farming simulator. Although some parts of dialog are repeated and events are always the same, great game.

game, Best, Best farming game ever, I downloaded this a couple of days ago and haven't put my phone down. Really addictive, I love the simple graphics and all the interactions you can do. I love the different maps at the beginning and all the animals you can look after. The only disappointment is I got far into the game, I cleared most of my farm and had chickens and cows and I've gone to log back in and it's gone. My game would usually automatically save and be fine the next day but its gone now. :(

game, great, It is a great game but when you finished all the main story it just then feels old and crave for something new. I think it needs a Online multiplayer mode that you can interact with other people.

stress, nonstop, Basically no tutorial, time goes by way way too fast, I can't find even half the people to introduce myself to even after days of searching. Fishing is ridiculously difficult. Finally caught a fish and I couldn't figure out how to put it in my inventory so my chatter just dropped the fish back in the water that I spent half the day trying to catch. It's way too much to manage and gives me nonstop stress and anxiety. It's just not for me
game, based, I AM 110% IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, like if you like farming, a long based game .. it just has everything and more. The only thing i'm sad about is the fact that .. the 1.5 update isn't on mobile but i do know that the creator is trying his best to get out there which i think is amazing considering the fact that he's built this inspiring game by himself. The creativity is definitely 10/10 !! Can't wait for more.

play, local, Really love this game and would love for their to be maybe a local play or 1-4 people can play together since it's supposed to be a small community. But still Id love local because then I can work on my farm with 3 or less of my friends or maybe my siblings!!!

concern, only, I love this game! I love all the mechanics of the game, the fact you can date some npcs and grow a farm. My only concern is when ginger Island will be on mobile
game, wholesome, This game is very addictive, and a (mostly) wholesome farming game. It's fun to watch your character develop relationships with the in game characters, to meet the goals in the game, and to find all the little fun things hidden throughout. There comes a point after a while where there aren't any more goals to meet - but android has yet to receive the latest version which includes Ginger Island and gives players more to do. Plus, it's fun to restart at least once after you learn all the tricks.

content, full, Need update asap, need full content like pc version, with ginger island, I post this feedback 3 times, but got removed. Why so?
successor, worth, This is, for all intents and purposes, the apex of farming games as of 2021. It is a worth successor to the Story of Seasons / Harvest Moon franchises.
delay, huge, When is 1.5 coming out? Edit: changed review because of huge delay with update
update, mobile, Beat Game Available on Google Play! So excited for that 1.5 mobile update!!!
things, many, There's so many things to do in it and you can mine, farm, forage, fish, and fight in the mines. 🥰💚💚💚🥰
items, existing, Addicted to this game. Been playing for 2 months straight. However, I do hope the 1.5 updates will be ready soon. We really need the "add to existing items", move Greenhouse, Shipping Box and walkways!
device, cross, no cross device support! I love playing the game, but I would like to play in both my tablet and phone and I can't do this. This is just unacceptable for this day and age :( I would give 5 stars but this is a major let down for me.

premise, overall, I have bought this game on every console I owned. This game never failes to disappoint but to newcomers, this game is way better on console. But! That is one big BUT... this version still serves its overall premise and still holds true to the story and gameplay. You can even use a Blue Tooth controler of you don't like the tapping controls. I just haven't discovered what update this version is on, so things may be missing from this particular version.

air, fresh, Exactly what it states it is. Developers do not oversell, misrepresent and present events that do not happen in-game. This is a fresh air considering the incredible number of false adverts these days. Does not force in app purchase. Worth every penny and I'll buy it even if its 2x more expensive.

game, Greatest, Greatest indie game ever. Simple, effective, time consuming and addictive, I can't wait for the 1.5 update!
games, favorite, One of my favorite games, can't wait for 1.5 on mobile.
issues, crazy, i really like this game its fun and i havnt noticed any crazy issues although it lags sometimes that may be just me
part, sim, I am OBSESSED with this game. The music, the storyline, the NPCs, and the fact that it's part farming sim part fishing sim part combat mining sim.... the possibilities are endless. Can't wait for the day Ginger Island comes to mobile. CA, you're a genius, and deserve all the fame and glory and love in the world.

game, Best, Best farm game
version, mobile, Played this on pc, mobile version advantage is I can play this while laying down
game, best, The best game for murder just kidding its a game about farming and it's great.
game, awesome, This is an awesome game. There is so much more to do than there is in Animal Crozsing New Horizons.
issues, few, The game is really good. But there are a few issues. The arcade game is really hard to play because of janky controls but if you practice it is possible. And the last one is you can't place anything on walls. I took of my window from my house and I now live in a cardboard box with no light. I can't see the exit now. I can no longer see. Send help.

game, best, I can take the best game on earth anywhere with me, what's not to love? The controls are fantastic, the graphics are just as good, I can transfer my save back and forth from my PC, and I can ruin the farming economy of a small town, epic.

youth, older, Simple but yet complex, funny yet mildly scary, repetitive but yet never ending fun. From older youth to adults there's something for all. The options for additional mods and user created content will keep this game alive for much much longer even now being out for a few years, I love when I found this "Indie" game if you can even call it that anymore? If you're interested in why you see this game get so much attention and countless videos made about it, download it and see the fun yourself! 5*

fun, much, So much fun! The app is just as good as the pc version. It doesn't have the new update yet but it's half the price anyway. For those waiting the new one will be on here eventually just a heads up. Very calming and fun to play on the go.

game, amazing, This is a amazing game!!
game, good, This game is a really good game. The only reason why I put it down for 3 stars is that. . . Even though I've been playing this game for a while and started a couple new farms. The game sometimes kicks me out for no reason when I travel to places. Sometimes when I'm walking from the path from the house to the town and I enter the town I get kicked, and today was the last straw when I got 2 prismatic shards. (Only had 1 in my chests) Then I went drove back to the bus stop and went back and kicked.

NPCs, extra, Downloaded this ti play something akin to harvest moon, got way more that I bargained for. Loving every moment. I would suggest installing the Stardew Valley Expanded mod for some extra NPCs and cutscenes.
game, great, It's a great game but I'm disappointed that the app has yet to recieve the most recent update to Stardew Valley that is available on PC and the games creator is already creating a new game before the old one is updated across all platforms. It would be nice if we had the update on mobile before the end of the year.

alot, missing, its fun but its missing alot from the pc version. mods on mobile dont seem to work and end game is really really bland from what i can see on thr mobile version. not much left to do other then mine 🙄 or make bottles of wine to sell. csn we please get it updated to have everything the pc version has for the love of god
purpose, little, This is wonderful and LGBTQ+ inclusive, but there's one thing: Children. I'd like to be able to actually talk to them and interact with them as otherwise they have little purpose and are quite uninteresting.
game, Good, Good game.
game, Amazing, Amazing game. Seriously there's nothing wrong with it , it's the only game you'll ever need. Now I just need the 1.5 version for mobile 🙏🙏

game, Best, Best game I've ever played on mobile. I played 1.5 content in pc can't wait to play it on mobile... people who are review bombing this game, go do something else with your life...
suggestion, only, Absolutely love this game. So enjoyable to play. My only suggestion would be to add more post game content. I also wish there was cross save available across multiple platforms. Lastly, please consider making the mobile version multiplayer! Other than that, this is my favorite game at the moment! 🖤

game, great, Some issues, but overall a great game!
game, Good, Good game.
game, Amazing, Amazing game all around. Two issues, however, the newest update for the game is not available on mobile and this version can get stale very quickly since there is a lot more to do in the 1.5 update. Another thing is the mechanics are questionable and sometimes the auto-combat uses a pickaxe or a scythe instead of your weapon, and sometimes the combat just doesn't work or stops you from being able to move because you are locked in trying to hit something that is too far away and can't stop.

content, good, Not up to date with PC version, missing a lot of good content.
farming, best, Clearly the best farming sim out there. And at the same time it is so much more than a farming sim. There are so many things you can do and so many paths you can choose - and that really adds to its replay value. And there are no ads and no in app purchases. You pay once and then you play it. This is the kind of game you could log a lot of hours on if you wanted to, and never get bored. There are layers of hidden things to unlock.

times, many, Absolutely perfect except for fishing. I have tried so many times, and have only caught one fish. I've watched tutorials and googled it and it seems like everyone has the same problem. Please please please change the way you fish and it will honestly be one of the best games.

people, other, Love the game, haven't run into the problems and bugs other people seem to. My biggest gripe is that it lacks a few features from the newer updates on other formats. Like edible monster meat from the combat tree, new places to visit, co-op, etc. So it's behind PC and console.

version, updated, Fun, insanely addicting. Always something to do. Just curious when mobile will be updating to the 1.5 version. Tried contacting developer but no response. Playing on my phone is definitely easier, but my switch has the updated version, So I might go back to playing it there.
game, best, This is the best farming video game ever, I played this on my phone and switch and I love it, this game will always have a space in my heart. 💙💙💙 (Also, if you don't like this game cause of "lack of content", remember this game is made by one person, ONE!!!)
game, enjoyable, Very enjoyable game. Just when you think you have played it all, something new surprises me. It is a very fun game to play. Easy and very well done. Im looking forward to the new update on this and the new game you made.

classics, other, This game combined elements from Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, and other old classics into a new and wonderful story. It's easier to play on PC, but I couldn't help but grab a mobile copy as well!

game, beautiful, This is the most beautiful game I've ever played 🤗
support, better, Needs better controller support. I expected controller to work the same as console or pc. Like being able to hold buttons down to auto chop/mine. Would be nice to have cross save compatibility also

rpg, mobile, Best mobile rpg pixel game ive ever seen and played and know. The game is just so iconic and a perfect representation of a gold standards of "how mobile 8bit rpg game should be, should look like and should function". Whoever created this game deserve a Nobel Prize.

character, new, i love this game but im having an issue. i can start up the game but when i go to the files and click my character, the screen turns black. i can hear the music and birds chirping but i cant interact at all. i even waited for a while. i tried to force stop. i dont know how to fix it. i dont wanna start over and make a new character since ive been playing on it for a while now and dont want it to go to waste. what do i do?
friend, best, I don't rate apps or games normally, but I LOVE this game, my best friend told me I should download it and I was skeptical because farm games are always so boring, but THIS is WAY more than just farming. It's romance, strategy, great story line, and you have SO many things you can do. Each NPC has their own vibe, and you can give gifts to them to become friends and maybe even more than that. They have likes and dislikes too. I am on my 3rd year (in game) and I've been playing for a week now.

fan, huge, I am a huge fan of Harvest Moon and this game is a great reminiscent of it. I love that this game keeps all classic fun aspects and adds things that I have always wished were available on the game.

time, low, Can't even fill in the forms to start the game. Can't name my character. Waste of time. Android games are at an all time low.
platform, other, Love the game. Was 5 stars but the lack of updates every other platform has kills it for me.
game, cute, well worth the money! it's a cute and fun game to play, I've already done 70 hours. it is a little repeatitive but that's the charm and its easy to play.
word, best, Incredible. That's the best word for it really. One guy, making such an amazing game like this. The PC version IS better yes, and if you can get that one. But for me, my pc version crashes regularly so this version is a god send. Stardew is my favourite game of all time. Abigail and Leah are my waifus, and I wanna hug Sebastian. Thank you Eric

updates, more, I love this game, it's really fun. I wish there was more updates, though. Maybe you could add a feature where your child can learn how to talk and maybe become friends with other villagers (so your child can go outside instead of just the house)? What I'm saying in a nutshell is please add more updates soon instead of working on other game(s) because Stardew valley is really fun! Once there are more updates I will change my review to 5 stars. :)

game, new, Sad. I was patiently waiting for the 1.5 update but now you have a new game? That's just sad.
game, great, Controls are a little weird, but apart from that, great game
thing, same, The year is 8. Day 25. Winter. Cold. Freezing cold. My husband won't stop leaving me alone with the children. Day in, day out it's the same thing over and over. Gather my crops, water my crops feed the animals, gather up the slimes, sell, sleep, repeat. I think I'm slowly going insane. I finished every task, befriend every unnaturally friendly towns people. I walk to the middle of town and shout at the sky...WHERE HAS THE UPDATE GONE. But alas, it's left us...AND SCENE. *Takes a bow*

applause, round, Exceptional once in a life time experience. Games like these are very rare. This is an invention not a game. The developers deserve a round house applause for this master piece. This is how a game should be made. Really impressive.

app, good, So when I first got this app I was so excited because YouTubers were talking about so I thought it was really cool. But when I downloaded this with my gift card it didn't seem to work and screen stayed how it looked. I opened this app from the app store and it worked. I honestly thought I would be better. Also I am used to playing with arrows pointing up and down aka like minecraft. Or like roblox bc I play roblox a bunch. But it's probably because I bought this on moblie. But it's a good app!
storyline, beautiful, Hasnt been a month since i downloaded this. I love it thank u for this beautiful storyline and the game itself 😭
trips, countless, Shipping items for me has been kinda glitchy. Lots of items never appear in my collection of items shipped. Puffer fish, duck eggs, iron, gold and iridium bars, kale. I like the pc version but this im having doubts about. Been playing for 5 plus years on the game and made countless trips to skull cavern and killed tons of dinos but never received an egg
updates, new, Love the game. I played alot on console, and I'm happy to play it on mobile. Can't wait for new updates and the spiritual successor to drop.

content, more, Needs the 1.5 update. Started to lose interest after a while of playing. Needs more content
hopes, high, bought it can't wait to see what all it holds. Updating review .Might as well buy the memebership & let the jojoa mart buy the hall. The fishing is nearly impossible the way its done. Sadly I had very high hopes and any one with hand issues or children playing will be unable to finish quests or community cener unless buying the fish for crazy amounts from travelling merchant is your goal and then not sure he offers them all. They need to change the fishing style.so to 3 stars till fixed.

game, Awesome, Awesome game. My only complaint is the fishing mechanics. They are ridiculously difficult and hinder access to game play. I'm stuck searching for fish I need in the trash.

games, favorite, I really love this game, and everything about it. And this is one of my favorite games, ever. I've played it on Xbox, computer, and now mobile. For me this game just never gets old, and there are not many flaws. I've made countless worlds and there are so many things to do, and when you do everything you can just start over and do it all again. Which I could do forever. I recommend this to everyone that can buy it.

graphics, simple, Ok, I do like the game, the simple graphics remind me of the long hours spent years ago playing those 8 bit RPG's on my old NES. Unfortunately I seem to have some control issues with some of the mini games. The game in the saloon for one, the guy doesn't move & just get's killed. Fishing doesn't work except on the first try when ya first get the pole. There's probably more that I haven't found yet. If I resolve these issues I'll revise my rating.

game, Best, Best game ever
version, mobile, I love this game on PC. I would give it 5 stars but the mobile version is almost a year behind the PC version in updates.
videos, most, Keeps saying it can't start bluestacks and wants me to send a problem report- I tried most videos but it also wont create and instance. Overall a really good game, wish it worked though.

thing, only, The game is perfect, the only thing missing is cloud save, I'm about to change my phone... And will have to start the game from zero again...

language, Chinese, No Chinese language. Bought it specifically for that.
game, Great, Great game but maybe not this platform. Updates don't go far and I'm out of things to do now that I have the upgrades, friendships bars are full and big "quests" done. No progress to be made now. Why play?
game, overall, Are you trying to punish player by implementing the fishing system which is quite hard to fish? It's quite hard, but overall good game

save, online, Edited: From 5 to 1 star. You know what? I paid for this game just to wait and wait and wait and to start again. I'm on Year 9 and now I have to go back because I lost my phone. There's no online save. And now you're looking forward for your new game? How about us waiting for 1.5? You're so unfair! Ofc, life is so unfair! This game is my stress reliever but now it's one of the worst. Oh god I regret buying this game 🥲 I want to be a game developer someday and I will never be like THIS 🥲

game, fun, Was a fun game. Got bored waiting for update that looks like will never happen..lowering score till then
game, good, It's a pretty good game I could play it all day, but I do wish it had Co-op on mobile I'd like it a lot more if did, but over all it's good 👍
platforms, many, I absolutely love this game. I have downloaded it on so many platforms. Its amazing.
platforms, other, Waiting for 1.5 on mobile. STILL. And now other platforms are getting yet another update. Seems like mobile has been abandoned.
game, Boring, Boring game. The writing is good.but slow. Good to rewrite .
minutes, first, OMG! I never knew about this game and I got so hooked the first minutes I downloaded it
games, best, Honestly one of the best games I've ever played, have sunk hundreds of hours into it and it has no ads. Only shame is that it's a version behind all other platforms and this version has no multiplayer.

update, mobile, So when is stardew valley 1.5 mobile update 😅
game, mobile, I love this game and developer. 5 stars HOWEVER, the mobile game isn't for me. I really liked it. It's pretty intuitive. Combat is... challenging. They offer plenty of controller styles. It's just not as fun for me, and I like my bigger computer screen when I'm digging through the trash. Totally worth the money. Very fun, I've just been spoiled with the computer version.

game, fun, Really fun game Initially challenging but it gets less difficult as you go and figure out what to do/gain skills. Very cute design. There's festivities during the year and they're incredibly cute. Lots of nifty details and ways to engage with the town and the villagers within it.

game, best, The best game on the playstore in my opinion. It's addicting and so so relaxing. I can't wait for the new update for mobile. I have spent over 200 hours in Stardew valley and that's must on one device. 100% recommend

exploit, version[fave, Love this game, I resently got a Switch and just had to buy it again for that. Now I have to choose between this version[fave exploit works but missing 1.5 content] and that one[has 1.5 content but fave exploit dosn't work]. If/when this version gets the 1.5 update it will bump the rating up to 5.

game, good, I love this game! It has a lot of choices and careers to choose from. I love speedrunning Stardew with my brother and racing him to finish all the content. But I am still waiting for the 1.5 update on mobile. Besides that it is a really good game.
game, lovely, Pc. Or android both have their pros and cons.. but still a lovely little game this

button, new, It won't let me get past the 'new' button
love, endless, I just have endless love for this game. I was hesitant to spend money on a farming game, but it's much more than that. Bought it years ago, I've kept it on every phone ever since and I love playing it. It's well worth the money and time, I love it so much I also have it on PC and x box, which I've found isn't uncommon with Stardew fans.

things, bad, Honestly, the bad things about this game is that it hasn't got the 1.5 update yet
port, clean, Very clean and faithful port of the game. Unfortunately no plans for multiplayer.
game, other, Haven't put as much into any other game.

game, best, Beautiful, played on pc, takes a bit to get use to it on the phone but honestly this is the best game for anyone. Cannot wait for 1.5 on mobile
fun, much, Stardew Valley is so much fun and the closest comparable (happiness meter) game, I've played, since my favorite, Harvest Moon 64. Is definitely worth the price, there's all these fun, interactive, unique and creative little extras in the game.

controls, mobile, Love the pc version, took me a second to get used to mobile controls and combat has an auto attack which is helpful on mobile. Giving 3 stars to show my disappointment that the mobile version will never have multiplayer. 5 stars on literally every other platform.

story, amazing, Always have and always will love this game, amazing story, amazing characters, amazing mechanics, amazing everything really. I'm on probably my 10th playthrough and I still find new stuff, although I don't really like mobile controls (console is the best experience so far) but it's an amazing game to pass time.

game, indie, Perhaps the greatest. indie game of all time smartly ported over to mobile. This game will swallow up your life. Touch controls work better in some elements (farming is much quicker) but not quite as good in others (combat). Still, an absolute must have for me.
game, new, 1.5 so slow, Looks like the dev is so busy making his new game. 🙄 They better add cloud save or multiplayer but looks like it's not gonna happen.
music, Great, I would recommend this game to people who want something with no combat or violence. There is combat in the mines but the critters you're up against are very slow and the damage is so minimal that it isn't stressful to play. I was going to completely avoid the mines but now I'm happily making my way to the bottom. Great music and immersive and relaxing sound effects. Play entirely at your own pace .

games, mobile, I enjoy Stardew Valley on the console so I decided to try it out on mobile. I really enjoyed it on my trial so much I will most likely buy it later and I NEVER spend money on mobile games.
Lot, great, Lot of fun, great to waste time But please fix this game from being freezing anytime, and update game version 1.5. Thanks for your attention (sorry if my english so bad) 🙏
level, next, Harvest Moon taken to the next level!
bugs, few, There has been a few bugs but over all pretty clean
experience, Amazing, Amazing experience, would reccomend!
fault, only, The only fault is that we don't have 1.5 yet but that's in the works. This game is incredible, it scratches an itch you never knew you had
game, Great, Great game
game, best, I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, this is the best mobile game, hands down. Pay the $5 or whatever to own it, it's so worth it! Tons of side quests & hidden gems, & YOU control the timing & storyline!! I play it as often as I can. Counting down the days til you guys put out the new Chocolatier game so I can play that too! 🤍

reviews, negative, Love this game BUT had to lower my rating. I'd rate it at 5 stars if it weren't for lack of cloud sync and multiplayer. They're kinda required for this game! Beginning to regret getting it for Android. Sigh... PS had to rate lower due to all the negative reviews that seem valid. Disappointing...still no sign of updated version on Android.

dog, Stupid, Stupid dog sits in the way of the bed so I can't sleep. Now I gotta pay the evil doctor to wake me up and use their magic gtfoutta the waydog powers. Super annoying. Fix it plz. Or give me the option to abandon the dog since it's gonna cost me thousands in hospital fees.

life, single, 5 stars isn't enough. You know what this is, you know ConcernedApe. What you're looking at is the single greatest farm life RPG ever created. Animal Crossing can kick rocks. This game has farming, combat, FISHING, friendship, romance, customization, mystery, and anything else you'd want out of this genre. It is, in my opinion, the mold by which every other life sim should be judged. Pick it up here, 100% it, convert your save to PC and mod to your heart's content.

update, mobile, I love the game! I really do, but, please we are waiting for mobile update for a loooong time. I appreciate your team's work! All support! I can't afford the computer version just yet and I was able to afford this game since it's also cheaper than the pc version. I'm just super excited to play the version pc has, i watched a lot of YouTube video about the pc version and It's super exciting! ❤️

self, same, Ported over from pc you would expect it to loose some of its fun. That did not happen here. The game is its same lovable self and is still great fun. I could not give it 5 stars however for 1 simple reason. The lack of multiplayer like the pc or console platforms have. Taking that feature out broke my heart. I have so many fun memories of booting up a farm with my brother and working together on it. That experience is now lost for mobile players. Its a mistake i hope the developers fix.

game, favourite, I bought this game on steam, switch, and android. My favourite game.
games, more, Overall the game is really good and well thought out and I love the characters and their developments, I've played off mobile, but if I were to complain about something ON mobile it would be the story plots. I cant live them, sometimes when I get to interact with characters it freezes and I can't watch the plot go on and thats something I'd like to experience, but overall, the game is great. I would love to see more games like this in the future.
masterpiece, beautiful, Fun harvest moon type game, for only 5 dollars, this is a beautiful masterpiece
player, multiple, This game is amazing just wish there was multiple player then it would be a 5 star
game, only, The only game you ever need
farmer, small, I really love this game both on mobile and console. I really like playing as a small town farmer and listening to my country music raising my family and growing my crops. Overall this is a 20/10 and very worth it
games, favorite, One of my favorite games! I love everything about it. The art style is beautiful, I love the free roam aspect, so many secrets to discover, the stories are so entertaining, and I love how interactive everything is. It's definitely worth the buy/download

game, new, So where is 1.5 for mobile? There's now a new game out and yet mobile players still haven't seen 1.5. Really? What's the deal?
option, Tapping, Since I play this normally on PC, I opted to give this a try on mobile. My two stars are because of: 1. Buggy controls. Controls did not work fully as intended. Tapping option wouldn't have my character move and I had the same issue with other control options. 2. Constant freezing when walking, talking, or just trying to play. It became frustrating and made it almost unplayable for me. 3. No 1.5 update and no statement since July about progress. At least say something to your mobile players.

amount, massive, After grinding at this game and putting in hours and hours to get a sprinkler so I can expand I find out it does basically nothing so now am unable to expand my farm without a massive amount of grinding. Very disappointing as I was excited to see the farm grow
game, Great, Great game i am on year 20 on one of my saves only thing i would like is for the 1.5 update or at least the perfection rating for mobile since some people can't afford to buy the steam or nintendo switch versoin other than that it is a fun game

player, single, I've been playing a lot of single player farm simulation type of game. and this game is without a questions, is the most exciting and enjoyable game amongst every other farm simulation game. Theres a few reason for everyone to play this game. First, the price is affordable. It's not that pricy for this kind of game. Secondly, the storyline is fun and acceptable. And last, you can play it with what ever way you want! Trust me, this is the best game that i ever play on mobile. Pubg is not a match.

sims, best, Hands down one of the best farming sims I have ever played. It is very well worth the money
game, fun, It's reallly a fun game though it has some bugs and glitches but is there a game that doesn't have one but concerned ape you should reconsider adding multiplayer mode and cross-play if much possible, all in all it's a great game

game, Great, Great and addicting game. Please allow for easy stacking of items with the button on the side and please update controller play as well. Some things just cannot be done with controller like placing of farm buildings. Equipting of rings or boots or clothing. Other than that this game is great for adults and kids alike.

arrow, up, My game doesn't have any updates. Like when I put stuff in my box the up arrow is missing, so I can't auto add and that's really tedious

DELETING GAME Sidenote: I was actually planning to get the PC version this payday so I could play on there when at home but I'm not spending the money on it when you guys left suck a big hole in your mobile game..

player, other, I wish this game could play with some friend and other player so it wouldn't easley be bored of his game
interactions, more, Edit1: I wish we could have more interactions with the dogs/cats and the toddlers. Feeding the cat/dog not just giving it water while it would be nice if we could give gifts to the child too and some clothes and dialogue for when the baby have grew up
escape, great, It's not very complicated it's fun and it's a great escape from the rest of the craziness going on in this world

game, good, It's a good game but please, we've been waiting so long for 1.5 update and multiplayer function especially! I checked the forums and people have been asking for multi on mobile since 2 years ago! Please make it happen :(
thing, only, I have been playing this for awhile, and I LOVE IT! The only thing Is SUGGESTING! Not complaning, suggesting! I would really say you should add co-op and multi-player to mobile/chrombook! I would love to play with my siblings and all that. But, as I said. I love it! I would definetly say this is my favorite game out of most of my games, and. There's a lot of them! Over-all, if someone asked me; 'Hey! what adventure roleplaying game to you recoomend?' I would say THIS! Over-all, this is great! <3

board, special, Okay I love this game, I've bought it on mobile, ipad, and pc, but why is there still no ginger island? If it's too big to put in this version I understand, but what about the special orders board? Please, give me something new to do. After a couple hundred hours of the same thing it's bound to get kinda boring lol. Right now pc is way superior if you want the full story.

personalitys, individual, It's fun and very interactive! You don't have to be good at it to have fun. All of the town's people have individual personalitys that are fun and enticing. The flow of the game is good and puts a nice purpose in the repetition. The grafics are fun to see. The only problem I have is with the fishing. I find it overly difficult to do.

joy, much, Stardew vally gives me much joy when I play it. It gets me away from family problems and it helps me when I feel anxious. Stardew is such a mysterious and fun game. I've been playing it for YEARS on end. I started out playing it on my dads computer but now I'm not able to. So when I saw it on mobile I instantly asked my dad if he could buy it for me. I'm not disappointed at all with the purchase.

school, good, overall it's good, very nice 'old school' graphics and storyline, attractive gameplay. but the thing i missed is the ability to move to canary island, which is very good to play if it was added to the mobile version. if i can get the updates, i think it'll be a great decision to give full 5-Stars to developer.

farming, Excellent, Excellent farming but the fishing minigame is next to impossible on mobile which gates some of the content. It could do with an autofish setting (similar to the autocombat)

adaptation, good, Very good adaptation, very faithful to the console/PC version, only real criticism is that fishing is 1000 times more difficult and that was my specialty so if I'm having a hard time with it then most other people will struggle. If I could give 4.9 that would be my actual rating.

items, multiple, This game is amazing and I can't put it down at times! The reason why the rating is low is because I can not sell multiple items effectively. I put multiple items in the box as suggested by others but my stuff dissappears and is lost and I only get money for 1 item per shipping which is really annoying... is it a bug? Can you help me please? I play on my mobile

player, mobile, I love the game! I've had it for a while now and am an exclusively mobile player bc I'm pretty bad at pc controls. I was wondering when Ginger Island will be added to the mobile ver? Or will it not be added?

game, good, Such a good game 10/10 time killer i just wish it could be multi-player on mobile (but overall it great!)
games, favourite, This has been one of my favourite games for YEARS. When I heard it was going to be on mobile I got it instantly. I love this game, there's an amazing story and it's so personalizable, immersive, and just fun. It's generally calming, but there's times where it can be stressful, heart breaking, loving, and so much more. I honestly do not know one person who doesnt like this game. This is my like 20th time playing it/beating it and I'm still not tired of it. Seriously play this, it won't disappoint

graphics, pixel, I love this game so much, I play it all the time. There's actually a lot you can do in the game so you don't get bored fast! Plus the pixel graphics are very good and the storylines are fun. 👍👍
game, good, Really good game overall the one thing that would make it better is multi-player.
hours, more, I own this game on five platforms. I've logged in maybe more hours than any other game I've ever played. $5 for this game is an absolute steal.

game, great, I think started valley is a great game. With the fishing to the events to the farming etc. It really is a great game it would be five stars if it was not for the buggy and lag items and sometimes it just is like a lag hole but a really good game would recommend.

game, Great, Great game for a while... then when you're done being everybody's best friend and bought all the fancy stuff you're kinda done... until this fabled 1.5 update that every platform but this one already has. I played religiously until a month or so ago when I ran out of stuff to do (other than cooking... I can't seem to bring myself to care about cooking). Update: Lost more stars because I'm still waiting for new content.

love, Great, Great game love it addicted but i hate how u cant play multiplayer if on phone or chromebook
game, Great, Great game but the controls are terrible on a small screen. Play this on a tablet or on console, you won't regret it! 5 star game with 3 star controls

vibes, major, Never thought I'd be into farming. I get major zelda/animal crossing vibes playing this.
version, mobile, I've got ~210 hours in it on PC, and the mobile version is just as good. Only minor gripe is that the controls are iffy at first, but you can change them.

save, backup, This is a 5 star game 100% but i just need help. I accidentally changed my Date size to 200 and now it blocks 75% of my screen making it unplayable. Due to the size i cant click on settings and change it back. I did not make a backup save and i really dont know what to do because i did a lot on that specific save.

platforms, multiple, Fun game on multiple platforms.
diversity, more, I really hate how fishing works. I know it's more realistic to have the fish give you a challenge but it would be nice to have some way to level up fishing easier. It would be nice for more diversity in the original game and some other things. Walking around and exploring is relaxing. Saving up money and supplies for things like chicken coop and barn takes a while. Wish there wasn't a word limit here.

day, first, Got addicted the first day I played it. It's kinda hard to maneuver the joystick though because it's in the middle left of the screen. The joystick makes it hard in the combat part but overall, it's addicting. Thanks developers for creating a great game!

game, Good, Good little farming game that's brings back memories from childhood worth every penny spent in my opinion. It's like playing an old Zelda.

store, opened, The shop keepers aren't at their post when the stores are opened sometimes. What a waste of a day when you walk across town, find a opened store, and the shop keeper is goofing off somewhere.
port, mobile, I'm finished with this mobile port. The Creator should have found another Company by now to complete work for a current update and already have been released...

game, fun, This game is amazing! It is so relaxing and fun! I love how you can talk to all the town folk! Overall it's a really fun game 100% recommend!
challenge, more, Good. but better if they can update the app to 1.5. and add more challenge. game is too easy to earn money. Add taxes / bill payment to the game. Please make it challenging.
time, long, This game is one I have had for a long time on my console and wanted it for my phone as well, due to it being a great game and one worth the small price tag you can't go wrong with getting this game, you'll love the whole aspect of relationship building, farm development, battling through the mines for valuable resources to upgrade your farm to reward you financially, all from dhe comfort of your own phone and from anywhere you are in the world.

pop, little, I love everything about this game. The characters, the art, the stories, they're all so fun and it makes me want to keep playing. No ads, no dumb little pop up things, etc. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone needing a break from something since this game is relaxing yet fun. ☺️

version, old, Not worthy to purchase, u didn't get to choose the farm the provide (always the farm near town) and u can't play the 4corner farm or multiplayer. U better purchase the PC version. I think all the npc and quest is old version. Don't waste money here,buy the PC version
game, awesome, The game's pretty awesome, though after you marry/be come partners I wish the parents or their friends would know it, and maybe have some special interaction?

dame, long, This what I was waiting for it a long dame time
version, mobile, I love it but when will the mobile he catch up to the PC version? I've pretty much beaten the game in 100 hours but the more I look up the more I see about version 1.5, that isn't on the mobile version. Just wanted to to know if 1.5 is ever coming. It's a great game tho.

game, Great, Great game. Relaxing.
rating, higher, I would love to give it a higher rating but until they make corrections on the fishing to make it possible to play it on a mobile and allow items to be built/placed outside the farm, i cant recommend the game. Did the devs abandon the app?
game, nice, basically it's a nice game, but it could be the best game if you combine it to life simulation game as well.. where their children will inherit the land and proceed with the mission.

ways, many, In many ways, the full stardew valley experience rolled into mobile but with automatic saves; very useful. Only issue, not full 1.5 version. Is waiting for that final touch.

graphics, beautiful, Uber amounts of content, beautiful graphics and gameplay. Farm your own vegetables, look after live stock, go for a quest down the mines, go fishing, unlock tools and equipment or find the one to share you life with. It's a farming/life simulator on steroids essentially. Feels like work, but isn't actually work. That's the beauty of it.

improvement, more, I have played the game before on our computer. I'm super happy its on phone but hope for more improvement in opening and closing the boxes, controls
game, entire, I'm personally amazing that CA managed to fit his entire game into the mobile platform. It's lovely, a great farming sim where you can get immersed in your inherited farm and start a new life, even if it is a virtual one. However, I can't offer that 5th star only because of a personal preference- I don't think this game should be played on a phone because it can be a little more frustrating. Tablet? Maybe. Computer or console? Absolutely.

game, Wonderful, Wonderful game! One of the best I've ever played. Love it. I have it on my laptop as well and its even better because of the controls. Otherwise its the same. Only bought the mobile because I loved the laptop one so much. I 10000000% recommend this to anyone ever. I haven't enjoyed a game like this since I started playing minecraft
game, Perfect, Perfect game to relax and cuddle up under a blanket, especially now in autumn. It helped me a lot when I was stressed out and burned out. The one thing I'd love is outside furniture and such, but I just did it wrong. Haha
boyfriends, multiple, Having multiple boyfriends at once used to be just a dream for me, until SDV came along ✨
fun, Super, Super fun.
vacation, nice, I originally got this game for my fiancee and she loved it so much I decided to give it a try. I can see why she loves it! This game is a nice vacation away from the stresses of everyday life.

update, new, Hoping for the new 1.5 update soon
game, relaxing, I played Stardew Valley on pc first and downloaded this when it came out. I was surprised to find that it was the same as pc and I am very happy about that. It is a super relaxing and enjoyable game that always seems to have something new to do. Worth the $ for sure!
killer, Great, Great time killer! Love this game so much
bugs, many, To many bugs
game, incredible, I LOVE this game so much. Its fun, beautiful, and endlessly entertaining. I have it on PC as well, and I am so excited for the 1.5 update to come to mobile sometime. Thank you, ConcernedApe for such an incredible game!

It's at a point where I now have it on my computer too. Such an amazing game. Edit: I'm on year three and have also gotten it on the pc, I am obsessed best games ever.

version, mobile, I am very happy with the game but wish that it had Ginger Island and a multiplayer feature. There have been no updates since I started playing the mobile version (I already love the PC version) which makes me feel like the reviews and suggestions are not being read by the creators. Please expand the game and add the multiplayer function 🙏🏽
update, latest, Whare the latest update
patch, excited, When Patch 1.5 will coming? Im so excited patch 1.5 in mobile... I hope this end of year patch 1.5 for mobile will comeout...

stories, interesting, Worth to play if you are a fan in harvest moon games in the past and it is mixed with interesting stories, character development and rpg
game, whole, I like how you purchase a whole game. No BS in game purchases. This game is soooo much fun and i have a super hard time getting into games.

No rushing whatsoever thats true! Everyone says that and its so relaxing you can just chill. Theres always somthing to do however. This game will never have you bored. Always somthing

game, awesome, This is an awesome evergreen game, just a hint for android players: When trying to water plants with your water jug and if it auto switches to scythe and removes your plants, kindly observe these plants are gone and turned to yellow colour. Hope this helps.

game, ideal, This is my ideal game. Self-paced, relaxing. The game play is very simple, yet there the storylines add a lot of depth. You can race to accomplish goals and get rich in a short amount of time, or just kick back and feed your chickens and cows and feel perfectly content. I've been playing for a couple of years now, and it's still my go-to game when I want to spend time just relaxing and feeling happy.

bug, horrible, This game is amazing, really addicting, I love the characters, but there is a really horrible bug that's been present through all my playthrough, when special events with some characters the game just wotn show dialogs so I have to skip them, this events are really big for progressing with the relationship and I CANT DO IT BECAUSE THE GAME WONT PROGRESS, i use the invisible pad + 2 buttons.

time, free, As fun and wholesome as played on PC, the game is adapted surprisingly well to the touch screen! I love it that I can now carry the game around and relax playing through a game day whenever I have free time during my life.
state, current, Love it. Can't stop. Please update to current state on pc so I have more to do.
games, best, One of the best games of all time. There are so many ways to play this game and it's so easy to get lost in the gameplay. If you enjoy the Harvest Moon games or farming simulators you will love Stardew Valley.

player, multiple, it's a fan game yet no multiple player its kinda unfair since some of us don't have any money to either buy a computer or switch it be much more better if you add a multiple player choice so other can finally play with their friends plus it can attract more players that way unless you did this on purpose so other people we'll just the game on their computer and switch just so they can be with their friend smart move yet quite unfair

game, actual, Not the actual game, Google play. I paid for this game, accidentally uninstalled and now I can't get it back! If I was able to pay for Minecraft YEARS ago, and can still get it again NOW, why can't I do that with Stardew?!
games, best, One of the best games ever.
gamers, freeplay, Definitely a game for freeplay gamers. I love that you can make your own farm and technically create your own life. Me and my brother are addicted to playing this game.

game, amazing, What an amazing game, but I'm so disappointed 1.5 hasn't been released yet. The gap between mobile and PC in terms of content is immense. 1.5 mobile is far overdue.
fun, Pretty, Pretty fun gets repetitive after a while tho
game, addictive, This is the most addictive game I've ever played on my phone!
game, good, Very good game, love the festivals and the heart events, also being able to choose from different ways you would like to spend your time is also phenomenal for a game. Also when will the new update be out? Just asking cause I can't wait!!😊

game, incredible, This is the kind of app I wish the app store had more of. The developer took a game that was originally meant for the computer and flawlessly allowed for it to work on mobile. You really don't find that often. Stardew Valley is an incredible and soothing game, one of the most well-made games I have ever played (for mobile and desktop both), and by far the most comforting.

day, mid, I love this game. I had the pc version and I love this just as much although playing by phone I wish there was a way to save my game mid day if I am playing while waiting to do something else it would be nice to be able to save. But all around great game.

game, Great, Great game, controls suck on the phone tho, I even connected a game pad and constantly find myself needing to touch the screen, bait won't attach to poles, and missing feature of being able to sit down on benches and chairs and what not. Also game glitches you in place if you cast a fishing rod and quickly change slots , found this out on accident trying to use bait. Was able to recreate it . Only way to fix it was to reload the game. Buggy but good, better on other platforms

game, favorite, I love Harvest Moon, so I've been trying to find something similar. I came across this game and it's been my favorite game since. I actually ended up just purchasing the game on ps4 and will probably do the same once I get my desktop set up. Literally is becoming my favorite game of all time. I hope the updates never stop

degree, frustrating, A degree more frustrating than the normal version, this version needs a controller. There are many control options but I find them lacking, and I don't see how it couldn't be compared to a proper controller or keyboard. A useful backup feature is kind of nullified by a cruel auto save feature. Accidentally axed an ancient berry? It auto saves sometimes on close! How convenient and cursed. Guess I'm starting that day over again. Screw gates, let your animals be free.

killer, fun, Absolutely fun time killer, with a lot to actually do. Great story too, as long as you follow the community quests and don't sell your soul for easy access to some features (you'll get what I mean when you play the game.)

hours, many, Stardew Valley has given me so many hours of joy and got me through hard times. It quite literally changed my life. The only things I'd like to see added are mobile multiplayer and more characters, cities, events, etc - really just more of it! I know that Stardew V. Expanded is a hit, but it would be nice to have things like that added into the base game, without all the extra work required for mods. With that said, I love the new features that do get added and I'm excited to see this game grow.

borderline, impossible, I want to support the amazing as much as i can but the fishing part is just awful its borderline impossible to do please fix it. It sours the gaming experience.
game, damn, Litteraly bought the game accidentally Uninstalled now it wants me to buy the damn game again I just want to play damiy
addiction, unhealthy, omg I fell madly in love with this game. and I have an unhealthy addiction to Sebastian 💜
game, Great, Great game, I never really expected much out of a farm simulator. BUT, this game is so much more. It has bioware like rpg mechanics. I hope that if I were able to create a video game it would be as great as this.
thing, wrong, Can't think of one thing wrong with this port. Love the game ❤️ and totally worth the price of 🎫 admission.
game, Great, Great game, but been waiting 7 months for the new farm layout. Will rate it 5 stars when it comes out.

users, mobile, Please give us mobile users the updates for this game.

version, mobile, Hello! I really love this game, but there are times that I feel lonely by myself, would it be possible to add the multiplayer mode on the mobile version? Still, I am always excited to play this game, i loved how it does not force me to do the tasks, and let's me accept them first if i want to. This game is a rare gem! rarer than iridium ores💖

game, Amazing, Amazing game! Can't wait for the next update. Just wish there was more quests, maybe some kind of weekly tasks? Otherwise I love it. Just gets old without quests

game, great, If you don't already know stardew, then it's a great game on its own and easily worth the money on every platform. My main concern with the mobile port was how they would handle the dramatic change in control scheme. But surprisingly, this is one of the best PC-to-Mobile ports I've ever seen. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and besides a couple inxredibly minor issues that I can't think of a feasible solution for, it's perfect. Can't reccomend enough.

updats, new, Absolutely love the game and its design as well as the game play, however I fully completed the 1.4 edition and have unlocked everything is almost a year ago, when I heard the update was coming out back in February I was so excited to get back into playing yet we still have no idea when the new updats will come and if it will finally give us mobile players the option to play multiplayer?? Ive been waiting for months but with brief info on what the update will bring Im feel totally ignored.

users, mobile, I really love this game. I just wish that mobile users were allowed to get an update to progress further. I finished the community center and the movie theater but I'm not allowed to progress because I'm on version 1.4.5. I know the creator doesn't care and wants to focus on other projects, but it makes me think, why would I bother downloading a future game from the same developer if I know I'll just be disappointed when they move on to something else?

game, breaking, Encountered a game breaking bug. I'm one year into the game story, and any time I open the game now, I can't get my character to walk anywhere. I can tap all over the screen, but my character doesn't move. I tried reverting to a previous save, but the issue persists.

issues, few, I love Stardew on PC and I'm so happy I can now bring it with me wherever I go!! There are a few issues unfortunately. I can't seem to figure out how to remove bait from my pole. Also my character doesn't choose the fastest route when I pick a spot to walk to. In fact, she'll sometimes go completely out of the way to go to the chosen spot. I have to micromanage the fastest path, which isn't a huge deal; a minor inconvenience. I also can't wait for updates that bring us closer to the PC version.

year, first, It is worth my money! I've been playing this game for about 2 weeks and I really enjoy it. Well it's kinda frustrating when I went fishing on my first year. I was also clueless about how to set the crab pot with a bait. But yeah I'm on my third year now and I've mastered it👌 (thanks to some guides on g0ogle). Also I really like Vincent & Robin characters and personalities🥺💕 I hope there's a marriage candidate as cute & nice as them lol but it's fine tho single is also a good option anyway😆

things, much, This game is MASTERPIECE. It is so relaxing for farming type game. You can do so much things while waiting for your crops to grow such as mining, fighting monster in dungeon, foraging, fishing and develop friendships with the villagers. It is my favorite game so far. However, the game takes so long to update and we're missing some of the feature that already exist in other device platforms like Ginger Island and Multiplayer mode. I will surely change my rate if developers will update it soon. TY

quality, Same, Same game quality as its on pc. Maybe there is a little struggle in tapping or rotating some furnitures but still manageable. If there is one thing I want to add is that the android version could cope up with the latest version in pc. It is more diverse and eccentric and will help for the future plan of players that last til end game. This is a great game. One of my favorites 👍

night, 9th, Save state can be super stressful. For instance, I will sleep on the 9th night and supposed to wake up on the morning of the 10th– there’ll be a prompt that the game is saving but when I decide to restart my day, instead of going back to the morning of the 10th, IT GOES BACK TO THE MORNING OF THE 9TH??? It’s so confusing. Please fix that.
game, worst, The worst game ever...I will be checking to make sure there is NO money taken from my account!
difficulty, added, If you love farming, some added difficulty if you want, and leisurely entertainment this is the game for you! Stardew beats Harvest Moon and other similar games by leaps and bounds and is overall the best farming time sink you can play -whether on mobile or pc!

sounds, ambient, After 2 years of playing...now when i load my save i get ambient sounds and black screen. Tried everything to fix it and nothing. So i'm not gonna waste more of my time on a game that corrupts saves.

port, good, Pretty good port of an absolutely fantastic game.

depth, much, The game has so much depth I'm like 60 hours in and feel I haven't even scratched the surface. I'm not a fan of paying for apps as I hop and change often and would try and help you save money if I could but this game well deserves its price tag and some! Legit a 5 star game for 7 quid... Its a no brainer guys... Edited to one star. My save file has just randomly been deleted.
travel, fast, Wish there were ways I could like fast travel back to the farm when I don't feel like clicking on the ground the entire way there with my phone. And if the cat would stop falling asleep in the doorway and yall making it a mechanic to not step over it so I can get to the frickin bed to sleep, that would be great. I dont think anyone appreciates having to over exhaust their selves to sleep so they don't have to wait for the cat to move. But it seems like yall devs don't care anymore.

platforms, other, This is a 5 star game. But it has been neglected on android. 1.5 has been out for over a year on other platforms and no update...
part, integral, Fishing (an integral part of the game) is far too hard and damn near impossible of the mobile versions of the game.

year, third, It's great and I'm completely hooked. I think there is a glitch with me cat's icon where she shows up as a dog and I think my third year got turned into my fourth year prematurely which I think glitched the second visit I think I was supposed to have with my grandfather. Had another glitch where I was stuck in my fishing pose, I let it sit until 2 am for it to unfreeze. Other than that, super fun.

items, certain, Game is great, it's simple and cute. Sometimes I struggle finding places like the forest or certain items. Fishing is a bit hard too, maybe just for me, but it's great overall. Great job!💕

person, reasonable, Okay with the help of google and a lot of patience, I got fishing to work. One: you pretty much must stick with the training rod for far longer than a reasonable person would expect. Two: you have to use your finger to fish. A stylus will not cut it for the gentleness they require in the tapping.

We should be able to phase through them!

platforms, other, This game is absolutely amazing and I have loved every minute of it. I have never played Stardew Valley on any other platforms, and I'm glad I decided to give it a go. I am hoping that Ginger Island gets added to the mobile version at some point as I've heard a lot of great things about it.

life, populated, This game is absolutely wonderful. This game starts off with your character getting tired from populated life, finding a letter that their deceased grandpa gave them a long time ago, they move into a place called Pelican town. There are many things to do in this game, you can focus on your farm and upgrade it. You can build the community center to get the ending of the game. And you can interact, and marry some, of the variety of characters and their different backgrounds. Amazing farming game.

personalities, own, I am begging the devs to see this. Please update the kids! Please! I wish they could grow to childhood and they go to school and have they own personalities. Maybe in teen year they argue with you. But childhood should last like 2 years and maybe teen is where they should stop growing, so they can at less help out. I don't know I just don't want them to stop aging at toddler. Maybe we could change their outfits and hair. Thanks for reading and let me know what you guys think!

farm, best, The best farm ever in my life. Nostalgia because I'm a Harvest Moon fans.
game, Worst, I can't for the life of me figure it out 😣😣😣 Worst game ever ! No help guide , no way to know why your doing ! Annoyingly slow !
game, fun, Incredibly fun and relaxing game, reminds me so much of playing harvest moon cute on my ds lite ❤❤🐸
time, same, This very quickly became one of my favourites. It is so simple, yet so detailed all at the very same time. It is exactly what the player needs it to be. I can't give this game enough praise. It really needs no explanation.
