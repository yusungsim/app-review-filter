content, more, So much about this game is fun and wildly addicting. I would love to see a sequel that adds more content and depth. Do PC OS instead of just PC as a console that never grows. More office upgrades and longer than 20 year story would be awesome too. Expand on genres allowing one than 2 at once.

dev, original, The original and still best game dev sim out there. Easy to get into and hard to put down. You're always trying to best your last hit, and the journey to the top is just as fun as it is exciting.

game, Great, Great game, but there were some issues of understanding the words and it was too easy, finished the game in 5hrs
type, sim, One of my favorite sim type games. Forgiving gameplay, but takes a bit of strategy and grinding to make the team you want. F2P. Definitely worth it.

type, best, I've been playing this game over and over for more than 8 years now, love it and still the best Game tycoon type of game out there. Has some flaws that just take the edge of the game being a 5 star review and the lack of a sequel after all this time is still frustrating but buy it, play it, and become addicted to Game Dev Story!

playthrough, next, It was OK, took a while to figure everything out. Console licenses seemed restrictive, maybe on next playthrough they won't be.
game, Great, Great game. Controls can be a bit funky until you get used to them. Otherwise, I'm really impressed with the UI - there aren't flashing buttons everywhere, and user is not presented with ads every 30 seconds.

feeling, nostalgic, At first, felt strange. But then I tried harder, figured it out and loved it. THIS and dev Tycoon is best out there. But this..... as a developer myself I even cryied when I got the first grand Prize. I imagined that being true. • GIVE IT A TRY. Even graphics have a nostalgic feeling making you remember or dream.

games, mobile, Fun and non-intrusive, like mobile games used to be. (Doesn't stuff ads down your throat, no microtransactions or pay-to-win). Some small issues (hardware engineer, secret characters, secret consoles, and winning GOTY are all very difficult to figure out without using a guide, less attentive players might not notice several key mechanics, and a somewhat boring postgame), but overall well worth your time. A sequel with more fleshed out mechanics and customization would be awesome

fun, Super, Love this game. Super fun and addictive. After playing a few times you get the hang of it. Only criticism is that the in game help for jobs could be expanded as that is quite confusing at times
game, Best, Best game on the app store.
games, other, It's fun but would have been better if each worker gained points after finish games and contracts. Also would be nice if the office can be expanded further since trying to get Gold is very difficult since you can't tell how other games are doing and how many companies you are competing against. But still a fun little app.

generation, random, Fun and cute, but becomes repetitive. The random number generation can sometimes be frustrating and very clear that it is simply random. I must say it is addictive and easy to play with music or a youtube video in the background after a long day. It is satisfying once you build an amazing game.

game, same, It's Game Dev Story, the same game I fell in love with over a decade ago. No game has managed to quite match its charm and formula since, but at the same time it's certainly showing its age. This is one of the best and most venerable games on mobile, but it could use an expansion or sequel.

rate, perfect, The frame rate, once perfect on my Galaxy Nexus and Droid X, is abysmal on my newer, faster Note 4. This is pretty heartbreaking with nothing running in the background and my settings set to "Performance." Update: Smooth as butter!
offices, bigger, I adore this game. Would have given it 5 stars if I could have moved to bigger offices more than twice. Some of the consoles that other developers bring out are a little too pricey for someone who knows nothing about game genres and direction, and I completed the game before I had even had chance to hire a hardware engineer to build my own console. However, once the game is completed you can still play on or you can start again with some of your achievements making next time round easier.

games, favorite, I love Game dev story! It's one of my most favorite games of all time and I've made two consoles and 43 games but my only complaint is that when you make a console you can't choose how it looks and when I made my second portable console it looked the same as the first one I made (The fist and second one looked really weird), and when you update the game again (if you do and please still update the game, many people love) could u make it so you can either change your office layout or customizeit

games, fun, To me, this is one of the most fun games. I just wish there was more to do. Also, I decided to see what the 1 star reviews were and a ton of then were dumb. I saw that a lot of people were saying that they uninstalled it or they were on a different phone and then when they went to install it again, it said that they have to pay again. That's probably google a google problem, not something they did. Another was saying that there is ads, when there isn't. I would say more but I ran out of letters

boost, add, The game needs an update I don't understand how an add boost at 80% fails 90% of the time that's not realistic and I have don't it over 20 time it's just point less to use in the game and also I have some high level/point on states and they contribute so little compared to some that has lower states and level other then that I like the game

review, other, add the ability to turn off blackouts and equipment failures. they happen way too often and stack to ruin games! I noticed you deleted my other review... keep deleting, I'll keep writing
years, many, great,played it for many years
story, more, The game is amazing. A little short maybe in terms of story and I would definitely enjoy a lot more story but it's still amazing. I played it for 8 hours straight and never gotten bored of it. I recommend this thoroughly
version, annoying, So a more annoying interface version of game dev tycoon. Nah, 5 minutes and I lost complete interest.

game, best, Literally the best mobile game I have ever played, it's so cute and simplistic but also addicting and complex! It takes so long to master and understand this game, I've played it for years after buying it sometime in 2017-18 and I still just keep coming back. It's better than This War Of Mine, better than Civilization Revolution 2 and on top of that it's better than MineCraft! (But only pocket edition).

price, high, Absolutely love this game!!! Just wish we could lvl up move then lvl 5 also the game system are way to high price. But it makes it more challenging. Which I truly love. So no complaining there. Great game.

experience, Wonderful, Wonderful experience with this game. I've been playing it for years and it's one of my favorites.
concept, neat, It is a neat and fun concept. However, the game needs more added to it as it feels half finished. It is missing more late game options. Once you get past the threshold, you are only chasing to try and get the game of the year award. Once that was achieved, I was never awarded the million dollars :(

box, small, The game is boring and you only get a small box to look at. The "game" expects too much out of the game creations than you can afford. The workers are limited with stamina and upgrades and training workers gives massively low improvements! And their "add bonus" attempts always fail. Even at 70%

play, single, Its a classic when games were being developed. Of course the game is kinda meant for a single play through and there isnt iap. Keep in mind this game came out in 2010, a time where loot crates hadnt existed and IAP werent as required like games nowadays were Honestly people who rate it now are basing it off of 2018-present. This game is great for its time. Its an old game but one of the few i come back to time and time again.

game, first, The very first Kairosoft game I played and I fell in love with it and the company. I love this game and I always will. Very simple and easy to master.
copy, cheap, Unfortunately for this developer, the devs of Game Dev Tycoon took and expanded upon the mechanics in this game (Game Dev Story) to the point where this game seems like a cheap copy even though this game was released 8 years before Game Dev Tycoon. If this dev cares to compete with Game Dev Tycoon, they need to play that game to understand, copy, and expand upon the feature set.

problem, only, My only problem is that you can't refund the game
simulation, fantastic, A fantastic simulation game, the one that started Kairosoft's fame (in the US, at least)! Having played it again recently, I do notice that it shows its age in a few ways. Gameplay gets repetitive after year 15 or so (depending on the player's skill level), and once a certain amount of capital is acquired it becomes nearly impossible to lose (or get better either). That said, Kairosoft definitely hit an excellent formula here that only gets better in their later titles!

game, great, Really great game. An organic and addicting gameplay loop, generally deep progression and only a SLIGHT misunderstandings of how the gaming market works. It's a solid 7.5/10, so I'll give it 4 stars. Recommended, even if you need to pay.

selection, small, I really enjoy the concept of this game - what im not a fan of is having such a small selection of possible employees, and then needing to make sure to have the right specific employees trained up specifically the right way in order to make the best games. It feels very limiting, and once I found out that I cant just build my team how I want, and with enough training make truly great games - I HAVE to get specific characters and train them in a specific way, I pretty much lost all interest.

boxes, tiny, I honestly use to love this game but the fact that the user interface is now ONLY touchscreen.... It's just terrible. The tiny boxes for an adult finger is just so hard to navigate and annoying, such a shame. Why would you not add the ability to have it either touch screen or like it use to be where I can have the directional pad? Dissapointed and Refunded.

part, most, Lovely! Genuinely loved playing this game. A couple of translation errors but for the most part very fun!

aspects, most, Exactly the same as Game Dev Tycoon yet worse in most aspects. But the fact you have to pay for it makes it not worth it.
games, satisfying, One of the most satisfying Sim games for mobile. Very simple to understand game, especially for me who doesn't play many games similar to this. The gameplay loop is very satisfying to me, I get a sense of growing a game studio. I highly recommend this and all other Kairosoft games!

game, new, I love the game but I am in year 12 and every new game I make theres a blackout or something that takes nearly all of my points from the game Im making so now non e of the games i am making are good and its making me lose the game..... I can understand if there's a black out every now and then but every single game that I make.... it starting to get irritating.

game, Great, Great game and should be celebrated for actually being a game you can buy, own and enjoy on your phone. In a sea of pay to play/win games that have infected mobile gaming this is a great example of how to do it right.

blast, absolute, So I've played this game before. It's an absolute blast. Or it would be if it even loaded. Infinite loading screens suck, and having to pay money to stare at a game that doesn't even open is essentially theft. You sold me a defective product. On top of that, I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game to see if it fixed the issue. I'm now being asked to pay twice for a piece of content I've already purchased and own. Is this legit how you treat customers?

It would be great with a more detailed manual or insights into the inner workings of your choices though, and methods to mitigate frustrating rng failures (like buying a battery backup system for those power outages).

game, fantastic, This game is PHENOMENAL! Seriously it is. It's addictive too. Its such a fantastic game. One thing that would make the game better is if you could leave like a review or something for people you hire. For instance I just paid an exorbitant amount of money for someone to doy graphics and they only gave me 6 GRAPHIC POINTS! Like legit I need to do something about that guy even though he's a game character!!! Lol this game is so fun lol.

balance, more, Soooooo much better than Game dev Tycoon. Particularly because the game appears to have more balance, and decisions available, unlike Game Dev Tycoon, which seems to be designed to cause bankruptcy.

console, actual, More than a time killer. I actually choose to play this on my phone over turning on my actual console sometimes.
successor, spiritual, While it was good in its time. Its spiritual successor Game Dev TYCOON has more features and more challenging than this game. Even though the graphics are way different, I highly recommend buying that game over this. This game did not age well gameplay-wise

actions, tran, All the games this company makes are great. No mirco-tran actions or time stops, no stupid marketing tricks. Sure the free versions of the games have ads but once you buy the game they are adfree. I've been really enjoying this game dev game and like how they approached choosing generes.I also recommend the game dev game by greenheart games (pc game) totally different game but same concept. Anyway play this game if you support games without mircotranactions! ♥

finish, able, Everything is great about the game. It's finish able within a day, addictive for a while and isn't pay to win. There's almost no sign of advertising and as far as I'm concerned it is a good little game that isn't complex and passes the time sufficiently. However, the manual for the game isn't specific enough, especially in the more advanced parts of the game like how to get a hardware engineer, and I feel like there should be more in terms of the offices you can move into.

years, first, Simple to learn and a lot of fun, but it gets too easy after a while. The story timeline is 20 years (about 6hrs if you play straight through), and the first 10 years is exciting and challenging with new consoles being released at a frenetic pace, forcing you to carefully consider your budget and market share of each platform. But after 10yrs everything slows down and if you figured out 1 or 2 successful genres you can just release sequels continuously and get the same returns every time.

years, many, I simply love everything about it. Been a fan of the game since it released many years ago on my iPhone device, I cant even remember how I stumbled upon kairosoft but I am glad I did! Game is so unique and charming, hope for a sequel. Ps the mechanics and gameplay of 'Game Dev Tycoon' on steam is suspiciously similar, they might have been a fan!

year, full, It's been a full year since I really play that game, now I'm ready for the actual review. Gameplay wise, this game hooked me up until I forgot about my assignment. Tons of options are shown, and the NG+ features extends this game lifespan. You can't just finish this game after 20 years, and wished to get the GOTY award. The main problem I have is how this game doesn't allow you to develop a sequel if that game doesn't make it to the hall of fame. But thanks for removing the 14 characrer limit.

games, other, Iv waited years for Game Dev Story 2. Never happened. They made tons of other games. And I questioned why have they not made their own Sims(or Sims City) version type of game. Combine everything they know into one game and sell for $20 or $30 on steam, then port to mobile on later date. Update(01/22/20): another thing I love about this game compared to all their others, is no in app purchases, none whatsoever, no lame loot boxes XD
Sims(or, own, Iv waited years for Game Dev Story 2. Never happened. They made tons of other games. And I questioned why have they not made their own Sims(or Sims City) version type of game.

game, casual, This is a casual game, not for the gamers per say like myself but i sometimes find this sort of thing passes the time... which is completely ok. so if you like a casual game relax and have cup of coffee with during work break,ect this not a bad choice and bonus you pay once which good value for money if your fed up with paying tons only to be asked for more and more this is refreshing that aspect. so value is how i rate this. try it

game, new, My genres and types aren't transferring to my new game so have to start completely over.
game, fantastic, The blackouts and equipment failures ruin an otherwise fantastic game.
game, Great, Great simulation game! Very fun and perfect to pass the time while on the subway.
problem, only, Returning to this game after at least a year and I'm still impressed by how good it is. My only problem is there's lag now and its more noticeable
depth, real, Starts out good, but gets repetitive quickly with no real depth and most of your decisions don't matter either.
screen, Touch, Touch screen controls positioning not quite right with the pixl 3 xl. Couldn't play because of it. :(
game, good, Very fun, makes me happy, do buy, worth money for buy, do it, good game. Though in all honesty the change title option should come before the ship. 1 star
game, great, This is a great game if you like tycoon games the only issue is when you get pro devs you will make 4 games in a year with rates over 8 and no challenge at the end. Also you dont dev. Online games =(

game, great, It was a great game and I don't find any bug
system, own, It's a game worth buying because you do have to use your head at how to make your games better over time, including if you want to make your own game system, which depending on what you put in it can cost a lot of money and is time consuming. However the more everyone in the game uses your system the more you get paid, the more you use it the more it sells on the market. I really recommend this game for everyone.
PH-1, Essential, Fun game but not optimized for the Essential PH-1
game, Good, Good game
things, more, Add more things to it please
consoles, best, I became my own Kojima and developed the best consoles and games around. Not half bad. Need to play it again.
memories, old, This game brings back old memories of consoles I used to play.. amazing gameplay and graphics.

strategy, lite, 6 years on, and i still can't put it down! Did 13 years and battery died :-D A great and addictive lite-strategy game that's fun to play and manage. Name your own games, create sequels, develop a console, attend expositions, follow the charts and make money! What's not to love? Only thing needed now is support for 4k devices and Google Achievements.

title, great, All I need is to let AI do the job and just imagine a great title. However, some genres that need to add in such as Strategy (real time, turn based, both tactical), platform, fighting (vs or beat em up), stealth, party, visual novel. Sport game should be genre instead of type. Shooter can be First Person, Third Person, Hero, Shoot Em Up. Type that need to add in can be space combat, crime, cop, sci-fi, post apocalyptic, more vehicles etc. Both genres and types can be combined with two or more.

years, last, I've played this game for 5 years, ever since Felicia Day mentioned it in her vlog. It's worth the cost for no in app purchases whatsoever! Installed this game in over 8 phones in the last 5 years and I keep coming back to it! Just as addictive and fun as a certain monster catching game we all know and love! edit: still playing in 2019! make a sequel!

aspect, good, it has such a good aspect of game design it feels like you are actually creating games and consoles!!
games, best, i think this is one of the best games i have played i got only one problem i need more to the game becuse when you got to the highest buliding the game just gets boring you have all the money and 10 10 ratings i think it just needs more to it like add more upgrades to the office or somthing like that.

game, good, really good game!! But it could be made much better in the future... i would definitely recommend buying this game it really fun!
game, fun, Honestly fun game to burn time.
time, long, I bought this game a long time ago for 10 cents so now when I click install it pops up with another purchase menu and I try to buy it, but it says I already own this item. How do I fix this so I can play this again?
priority, audio, I love this game.....but the in game music gets obnoxious quick and even when you turn it off to play Spotify in the background the game still holds some kind of audio priority which causes Spotify to stay at a much lower volume while in the game. please fix this so I can give 5 stars!!!!!

game, similar, I have always liked your games. I would have given this one 5 stars but it seems like every time I get my stats up high like my fun or graphic for instance. the lights crash or another company is making a game similar which means I dont sale many units. I would understand if it was every once in a while but it has been every time. if I purchase a game I expect it to be fun. that isn't fun. plz fix this issue. thank u. an I will still continue to play your games

game, amazing, gave it 4 stars only because after 7 years I believe the game is over, please add more to this amazing game
rng, much, it felt like too much rng. the combinations that work together didn't seem obvious to me.
office, bigger, I love this game so much and it is really addictive but the reason I gave it a four star because not much to do after I created my on console and all and me making Hundreds of Millions with hall of fame games ahahah I just wish the developer can add more into it such as a bigger office upgrade and also more types of awards and maybe you can make a scene such as the gaming company itself makes its own game con and you get ti announce new games from there before selling it

experience, good, Overall, the game is good, and offers a good experience. Although, my hands shake and i have muscle spasms, so half the time, when using an item, in this instance it was a change career book, i changed to the wrong carreer when i just wanted to see how it would effect the staff member, if there was something else to confirm, insted of double tapping, it would be better for accidental taps, that in my case ended up costing me the whole game, as i was doing good until the second that book was used

round, fourth, Going through my fourth round. Took a bit to figure out how to make a console. You just need to get a bunch of job change manuals and max everything. At least that's what I did. A few parts are a little rough around the edges, but for the most part, I'm one hundred percent satisfied.

concept, great, great concept, but the skills of your employees has little to no effect on major stages of development and is relatively pure RNG and this is terrible for this type of game. maybe if this system was fine tuned a bit more and didnt rely on manipulating save files to load right before and after huge decisions, it wouldn't have such a huge difficulty curve at the beginning. I really don't want to spen an entire hour or even more just setting up a game. Absolutely dreaded everytime I began a game.

hours, many, The best Game Dev Simulator around. Been playing this for many hours already. Would really like a sequel.
problem, second, I keep coming back to this game, very enjoyable! Two issues though, my (google play) music gets lowered upon opening the app; I don't know jow to fix this. the second problem is the hitbox of items is too low on the Galaxy S8.
game, Great, Great little game, I never regret a Kairosoft purchase

game, Good, Good game but tooo short... Edit: From 5 to 3 stars because there is a bug. Unfortunatwly you can never create a consol yourself...
options, more, Needs to be updated. I did love this game but It needs to have more options in what you want to do.
game, Great, Great game! I wish there would be a sandbox mode though.
waste, huge, This game sucks. Touch sensitivity is garbage. Could tap hire from word of mouth and it does the hire from magazine ad. Also poor ai why is the designer asking to improve the sound all the time? Really huge waste of time.
game, great, A great game that I've been playing off and on for years. I had to take 3 planes yesterday, and this game was instrumental in helping maintain my sanity. The controls need work though. The menu touchscreen controls are offset weird, so you pretty much have to use the button controls at the bottom.
phone, diffrent, Authentication problem when i install the app on two diffrent phone using the same account.Fix this my money is wasted

loop, good, Pretty good game loop. You run a game company for 20 in game years and try to sell the most games or consoles possible. A lot of different ways go create new games. Will probably last you about a month of playing so not too bad for the price.

game, Great, Great game for passing time. I really enjoy the game but wish it would get updated to add parodies of the newer generation of consoles such as PS4 and Xbox One. But overall, it was a great gaming experience.

game, nice, This is a very nice Game Dev Simulation game, the controls are bit clunky and can get annoying at times, but the overall concept and way it works is great, I suggest this to everyone who wants to try a Game Developer Simulator with simple graphics.

steps, first, The game is amazing. The first steps are hard, but after you get to know the procedure you start making top selling games. I finally got the grand prize.

simulation, favorite, One of my all time favorite simulation games on the market. I find myself coming back to it over the years and I'm glad I purchased it. Once you're at the top there's not much else to do but restart with all the genres you've discovered and leveled up to see if in 20 years you can best your previous score. It's great that the game continues after 20 years but sucks that it doesn't keep track after. Either way it's a fun game that you can dedicate some time to. Hopeful for updates or a sequel.

permissions, more, Original is 5 stars. Why do updates require more permissions and have no patch notes? They are moving to ads and freemium games. Stay away from Kairosoft.
games, favorite, one of my favorite games on my phone I've played it for years definitely worth the cash

thing, wrong, this is all in actuality very good I cant find a thing wrong with this 5 stars!
challenge, nice, This game OBVIOUSLY deserves a sequel. The mechanics of this game felt so natural, presenting a nice challenge. This game is very engaging, putting you up against managing the creation process of a video game such as it's budget, staff productivity & skills, and pairing genres to make your game project feel unique & quality. The only gripe i have with this game is the learning curve due to poor tutorials. Otherwise it is very fun making your rag tag team of developers launch unique games.

engineer, sound, oh no, there's been an equipment failure! oh no, there's been a power cut! oh no, a game has been released similar to ours! oh no, the sound engineer shot himself! OK I made that last one up but it's really frustrating at the rate of issues that come up, every time I try and make a game I get one of these issues that halves my current points. Also contracts are a waste of time at higher levels, takes far too much effort to make a console when you don't get much of a reward from it.
