's, game, good, It, It's over all just pretty good game and it's basically olmost as what u would get on a console or a monitor but only problem whit it is that when I start to look around it starts to break stuff cuz that's what it thinks I'm trying to do
were, game, good, it, I practically grew up with this game. It's shaped me a lot, and I'd be lying if I said it weren't a good game. I also don't get why people get mad at the micro-transactions, as it isn't like EA where you have to pay to get better at the game, they're just texture packs and skin packs that barely affect the gameplay. You're also not forced into buying anything. Sure, the game has a few glitches and bugs, but that's mostly when you're in a beta version. All in all, I highly recommend this game
is, 👏, amazing, it, Best game ever and it is amazing 👏
's, game, good, it, I think it's a really good game but in Servers it can get very laggy ,other than that its A great game
is, game, good, It, It is such a good game,you can build fight and do whatever but just two problems first one is you have to bye It for 4.99 and second problem you have to bye mine coins with money to play like realy good servers.

is, game, good, it, Sorry for the bad reavaew I am injoing the game it wold be nice if the fox did something the question button is in the way because I'm always accidentally hitting it what I'm trying to get out of my crafting and inventory menu other than that it is a really good game I suggest downloading it it is also great for playing with your friends especially during this quarantine
are, problems, only, These, 1. I am unable to rename stuff using an anvil. 2. When I write in a book, close it, and reopen it, none of my writing saves. These are my only problems, and they are in my Realm. Just my Realm.
is, time, first, this, I really like this game! But, there is one weird problem. So when I built my house, I left the game for 3 hours, when I came back to check on my house, part of the floor was smashed, the anvil was missing and the stairs were gone. The thing is that I have a brother who can join my world, but when I discovered it, I looked at the chat and no one had joined. This couldn't have been Herobrine because I know he got removed in like 1.16, and this is not the first time this happened to me. Please fix!
's, gust, good, It, It's a good game gust very expensive and I can just play for free on my PS4 but still an amazing game defo recommend

be, dad, bad, that, I'm not giving it full stars because there's a lot of dying in it and that could be bad dad well might be it be so I'm just not gonna give it full stars unless it removes dying
is, game, great, it, it is a great game.
is, game, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic game, however my only irrational complaint is the devs and support team. Whenever me or anyone I know needs a bit of help and emails em, they ALWAYS respond with this snarky, lazy tone. I know all support teams are like that, but honestly I thought Minecraft would be different. Also they usually aren't helpful at all and the only thing they reccomend is to try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Thank god I tend to he good with computers tbh because they really don't help
is, game, favourite, It, It is my favourite game.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game
was, something, wrong, something, Wow this works where i want to be well now exactly i wanted a pocket edition minecraft i thought this was the pocket edition but they wasn't but i still enjoyed it was so great but something was clearly something wrong with yours i don't know but it looks kind of weird but it is a live it is minecraft so i won't judge
's, game, cool, It, It's a cool game
is, game, creative, it, This game is awesome for many reasons, but my main resason is that it is a very creative and family friendly game that is easy to control and mess with (sometimes it gets very glitchy and even crashes.)

is, 😎, cool, it, it is cool😎
is, experience, great, It, It is a great experience! Its amazing
was, stuff, fine, it, Minecraft is in my opinion one of the best games out there, but, there's a bug or something in the mobile version. I bought this and was really excited to play it, because I can't play when someone else is using the tv or while my computer is broken. When I opened it up, it was fine, normal Minecraft stuff, But when I made and joined a survival world, I couldn't do even so much as make sticks, splitting a stack isn't working and even another user was confused as to why it wouldn't split.

's, game, great, It, It's great game
is, app, great, It, It is a great app but it would be great if you could add more breeds of dogs, at least a pug dog. But also it is not letting my friends join, it says im not on
is, app, amazing, This, This is an amazing app it is one of my top 10 favorite games i hope in future updates it gets a lot more better with new mobs
is, game, favorite, it, Wow where do I start, I've been playing minecraft for as long as I can remember and it is still my favorite game and will always be. I just love it, there are so many things that you can do like build whatever you want, explore the world, fight monsters and travel to a different dimension and explore it . There are just a few things that I would love to be added to this legendary game like Excalibur, new bosses, new portals and dimensions and last but not least new mobs mojang thank you so much!
is, game, best, This, This is the best game ever! It keeps me entertained and I can use my imagination as free! Because all those rip-offs of Minecraft have ads and u can barely play on the rip-offs! Thank God for Minecraft being made!!!!!! And I love the axolotls and goats thanks Mojang for adding the axolotls and goats 🐐!
's, game, best, It, It's the best game I discovered
is, thing, only, It, It is ok the only thing that surprised me was that you don't have to buy it if you what to us it on a other computer
is, game, great, this, When I undownloaded and download minecraft back all my worlds were gone even when I went to external storage. Now I lost my whole survival world and all of my creative worlds where I built lots and lots of hard and time consuming builds. But overall this is a great game and very fun.
is, game, interesting, It, It is very interesting game
's, app, great, It, It's a really great app, but it usaully kickes me put of my acconts! Please thix this... 🥺
's, game, best, It, It's the best game in the world no joke. I love the gameplay and everything, however, (Mojang if you're seeing this) can you patch up the glitch that makes my pets disappear? It happened twice in my world and it's really depressing.
is, game, amazing, This, This is such an amazing sandbox game i've ever played!! Never get tired of it, it just too good! Thanks mojang for making this beatiful game!!
is, 💞, good, Everything, Nice 👍🏻 Game! Everything is good perfect and comfortable 💞 BUT I gave this game 4 🌟 s cause there should be a tool that can be used to decorate blocks.. I know that there is a mod 'chisel and bits mod' which is only for PC USERS!? I don't like that because mobile users cannot access to that mod 😖 please put a tool that can decorate blocks without any mod like that chisel and bits one.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game for craivit people.
is, game, put, this, In my opinion, this is a well put together game. I've played minecraft on console, and yes, the mobile version is different, but in my opinion it is better than console.
was, game, first, You, You was my first game that I love back if I'm worried it's the most popular and most modded game

And their are a lot of food like🍪,🍯,🎂,🍎,🍉,🥕,🥖,🍗,🍛, golden carrots, golden apples,fish, basically they have a lot of food for vegan people and for non vegan people! It's also kid friendly! Also I'm not a robot. If your new play on creative🤗

was, experience, good, It, Minecraft has always been one of my favorite games and I had to play on my PS3 because I didn't have any other consoles. And I didn't have money to buy minecraft on my phone but I got money and I played it. It was a really good experience and anyone who is reading this you should buy it. You won't regret it.
