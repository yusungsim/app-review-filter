tier, new, This game is okay. It should be free since they make the heroes paid for. It's pretty lazy that the towers are just reskins of the kingdom rush towers but the hero system and new tier 4 towers are cool. The maps and enemies are also cool.

tbh, fun, Game is fun tbh but my issue is that the unlocking the game fully (getting all the heroes) is legit over 60$ for a phone games and it seems every kingdom Rush game is the same on Android where it's a cash grab to get the full experience idc that what they give you is good enough the game itself is not free so 10$+ for a hero is ridiculous

game, fun, Not a fun game. You are locked all the time. There's only one strategy to beat some levels, your job is to discovery it. AI is stupid. You can have the best archer tower, but your archer will only shot wrong target like skipping the necromancer and shoting the caskets and zombies. Does not worth the effort since you are not free to try different sets.

game, second, KR series is one of the best tower defense mobile games I've ever played. This is the second game I purchased from KR series. Enjoying it so far, even tho some levels are quite a hassle and need a few attempts to complete it, but it's a nice experience overall.

games, other, Probably the worst of the series. Levels are ridiculous even after having completed all other games... Too many invulnerable mobs that ignore or disable troops and towers... Its as if they forgot how to make levels challenging and fun without using god mode for every other mob...

game, first, I never buy games for phones, no matter how cheep they are, but after finishing the first game, i Just needed more of kingdom rush. More than worth a couple of bucks.

game, fav, My fav childhood game. I've been trying out all kingdom rush games and this one does not dissapoint. Gameplay is very similar to the first one, so it feels like a sequel. But it does have a few annoying touch glitches occassionally.

aways, cheap, In a day and age where apps are predatory and cheap throw aways, this game has aged like fine wine. Definitely worth it's cost

round, perfect, Bugs Beat Nazeru's Gate without taking any damage at all... still 2 stars. Not sure what else you want beyond a perfect round to get 3 stars. Nowhere in the app to report bug not contact support.
fun, Pretty, Pretty fun
apps, Paid, Paid apps should not have high cost pay-to-win in-app purchases. Heroes that used to be unlockable through gameplay are now pay-to-unlock only. Very disappointing.

people, more, I will always love kingdom rush games, but it is a shame you have to pay for it, I would bet alot more people would play it if it doesn't really cost anything. But in other words, great game and game franchise.

rewards, more, Just avoid. The game play needs serious re balance to keep the player motivated without breaking the bank. I tried but gave up and just uninstalled it. Developer, be greedy but not that quickly. Earn the players interest by letting them getting through with more rewards. Once hooked, they wont leave.
times, few, Have played through it a few times now, it's great for killing time
favourite, least, Although my least favourite of the series, it is still mountains better than any other game out there so gets that 5*

game, hardest, Id say the hardest game of ironhide, you will completely enjoy first time playing it with how hard and challenging it is compared to others while also following the story, both artillery are op and templars are expensive and useless, assassins even more useful by just normally blocking not 3 overly tough templars in a game where enemies will flood you, and for sake nerf the deathcoils! That single enemy limits and remove heroes, reinforcents, barracks, and necromancers on darklight depths.

game, good, A pretty good strategy game, hard one too. You might need to spend about $5 to buy the top hero tho (the green dragon one, otherz aren't worth it). But that should be it.

game, last, AWFULL! Another franchise RUINED by the pay to play.... The last game that I will EVER install from this publisher again.
game, free, I've played the free KR game & it's good, it would probably be the best free one, but still it has its issues in game play which became annoying. Frontiers is a big improvement on that game and the power ups are diverse and more intelligent. The hero's are still not great. The ones that come with the initial game are ok and will do. For more money, u unlock new hero's I don't see any major effect on the game play. They do different magic but they dont affect game play but cost you money. 4 / 5

game, best, Subjectively the best KR game, the main campaign is really good, the post game campaigns are some of the best is the series and while not much change with the towers mechanic, it's still fun to mess around and see what kinds of stupid defense composition you can get away with, the heroes are all unique and fun to play with, while some are definitely better than others, all heroes are viable somewhat. Definitely the definitive kingdom rush experience, and one of the best tower defense game ever

games, many, I dont play many strategy games but I love playing games on their hardest difficulty. However, this game feels impossible to play on anything but easy. I have tried different strategies and using various towers at choke points but still can't beat Nazarus gate. I will say that the game would be top tier if I could actually advance in the game, just feels like I hit a brick wall. I will say that this gamecould be top tier if it wasn't PTW and you could repeat levels to prepare for harder levels.

interruptions, stalled, Touch screen controls are unresponsive with command prompts on the screen. Very annoying when getting swarmed and need to upgrade while also calling for reinforcements. The stalled interruptions affect huge aspects of having good or not gameplay and is just annoying lol

levels, extra, I've been playing this series for a while and this is one of my favourites of the series, the graohics are amazing, and the towers and heroes are well thought out, what would give this five stars would be extra levels based on the tribal arc. Thanks you for these amazin games, keep it up!

game, best, The best TD game ever because it also allows to choose heroes and support troops. 4 stars because I want Ironhide to add new levels and lands so that this game will always have endless levels like Clash of clans my another favourite.

level, 15th, On the 15th level they made it basically impossible to beat. The last boss destroys your towers. Then after you deplete its health. It breaks apart and your towers have to kill the little balls, before it reassembles. After it reassembles it destroys more towers. Unless you buy gems and keep spending to actually have towers. You'll lose, I had every tower fully upgraded and every spot taken. 2 different games, and this boss just keeps destroying them. Then when it's a quarter health it barely...

transactions, micro, The developers has decided to add micro transactions to unlock heroes previously unlocked due to gameplay. No mention of this in patch notes, just randomly making heroes locked behind a paywall. Would rate 0 stars if I could. I have played each of their series and this latest action has made the game and the company behind it a strong no go for me from here on. Avoid their titles.

step, slight, This one was a slight step back from the original. The character designs and towers are fun, and have new powers which make them fun to use, but they have haphazardly mixed enemies of different armor types across every choke point, severely limiting your strategy input because there is now no way of balancing your towers and keeping the resistances segregated, so now it feels largely up to rng whether or not your towers actually target who they are intended to and makes resistances arbitrary.

moves, clear, I bought Boneheart and I don't exactly regret it, however he needs to be changed a little with the ai, half the time he doesn't attack a target that's right under him or near him, just sits there. He uses the golems and the lane clear moves just fine but in terms of targeting the enemy, lacking. I know it's an older game but I love it ☺️ just please fix Boneheart is all I ask

areas, different, This game is seriously perfect. I loved playing through the levels and venturing through the different areas. Kingdom Rush Frontiers stayed true to it's previous game and perfectly added on to the previous game's story. It's good in alot of aspects, although I can say it can be a bit too challenging sometimes, even with easy mode. But not always. Oh and it's not pay to win, I do lose alot, but eventually you will get the right defense and beat the level. Just don't give up. Loving the music!

challenge, interesting, An interesting challenge.
level, last, I loved this game all the say up to the last level. I can't figure out how to beat the final boss. I won't describe him, so as not to spoil, but he seems impossible to beat regardless of the towers I use. I do not know if that was intended to force the purchase of gems to get items, but it doesn't feel like you have a prayer of winning without them. Either way I have to take one star off. I like a challenge, but that boss feels excessive.

maps, new, I'm giving a three not because the game is bad. Game is good and well designed. But it has been years. And there is no updates, No new maps, it doesn't have anymore challenge.
notch, Top, Top notch tower defense games. I'm not much into the genre but I do love the Kingdom Rush games. Perfect game for mobile as well.

cause, low, One star low cause 1; they asked me to rate. Usually I hate that, but I like the game. And 2; only played 3 maps. Not entirely sure I like the rest yet. Other than that very solid game.

strategy, real, I remember playing this back on kongregate and its still just as fun as i remember. Forces you to use real strategy and is challenging. Heroes are varied and fun to use(even the payed ones). Overall definitely worth the 3$ you pay for it.

maps, different, If you liked the original, you'll like this one too! Pretty much the same so far, just different maps/looks, but I'm only 4 lvls in. Tower Defense/Strategy game, a few basic heros come with the game, extra heros cost $ each, but by no means is this a pay-to-play game (you won't need to buy them to win, they're just different from the ones that come with the game. They're usually a bit better, but that makes sense to me/is fair, since you pay for them).

reinforcements, clutch, I enjoy this game but I find very frustrating in clutch situations the way the game screws you over. 1. When trying to play reinforcements at the bottom of the screen, you are blocked by a box telling you that you are placing reinforcements. 2. Often the game will glitch as you try to place clutch reinforcements, either re-centering the screen at the worst possible moment or becoming unresponsive just when you need it to placeI enjoy thi reinforcements when are trying to place reinforcements.

pass, Uninstalled, From the beginning you're behind like most of these games they want you to pay to be able to do well. Played 3 times before I couldn't win. Uninstalled pass on this garbage!
rating, low, Please do something about the champions. I bought the game and then you want me to pay $45 to unlock all the champions? I thought you where better then this Ironhide... Obviously I was wrong. This low rating hurts me since I've been a fan of your games for so long, but I will not support any company like Electronic Arts (EA). What's next Ironhide? Loot-Boxes to unlock everything? Ads after and before every round? I will no longer buy anything from Ironhide till you do better. Don't be EA...
continuation, amazing, An amazing continuation to an amazing game. There are some reused assets, but here there isn't any real reason for them not to.

games, other, As with their other games... You buy the game, just to find that you have 4 out of 16 characters unlocked. To unlock the full game, pay ~5 bucks for each of the 12 locked characters... "But the game is perfectly playable with just those 4!" No, devs... That's not the point and you know it. Not cool.

management, Great, Awesome!! Great resource management tower defense game!!
items, usar, Un juegaso bastante complicado en modo veterano, sinceramente hubieron 2 niveles que nunca he logrado pasar con 3 estrellas sin usar items debido a su dificultad, es un tower defense increíble, y sus 3 primeras entregas son memorables (la cuarta no es mala pero es meh, vale mucho dinero para lo poco que ofrece)
levels, balanced, very well balanced levels, money well spend
levels, few, I've only played a few levels so far, but they've been great. I appreciate the ability to upgrade towers between levels as well as level them up during play. Seems like a great TD.
series, Whole, Best castle defence games out there. Whole series is brilliant- funny, challenging, well thought out. I've played these and others in the series to completion, would love to see a new game from these developers!

time, good, I had a good time in fact it was better than I thought, it was worth my money. I watched a lot of ads for gems then prepared for a boss and when it was boss time it glitched and there were no enemies for minutes and so all of that ad watching went to waste.
series, incredible, And incredible series of Tower Defense games!!!
play, goggle, the achievement i not detect in goggle play but in game it's detect

focus, heavy, Of all the games on the app store that are so contrived and stale, with obviously no passion or thought put into the art style or playability. And their heavy focus on getting you to buy things to progress, Iron Hide, the creator of kingdom rush, brings a breath of fresh air to mobile gaming. I've played this game and its other sibling games for years and they are some of the best mobile games out there. Truly a 5 star game.

stratigy, nice, Kindom rush frontiers is really fun and a nice stratigy game, same with all the other kingdom rushes however frontiers gives me a good challange and i like it but i dont like the one time offers i would like them to last a day or so so i might get the ones that i want, cus today i found a one time offer for the heros ashbite, and boneheart for 4.99 but i couldn't get it in time, also i don't usually pay for games but this one is worth the money.

game, Great, Great game with amazing world building. Good engaging art and animations with well though out designs for each character and tower. Some heroes are costly but the free ones that come with the game already have impeccable skills and incredible mechanics. A great game to play when u have time to burn. Highly recommend!

ways, long, I beat this game on PC and am loving the app version. It's come a long ways since it came out on ArmorGames.
version, free, Played the free version and was hooked. I have not paid for a game on the play store for a long time but this one deserves it. It is quite rare for a video game sequel to actually improve upon the existing mechanics without dramatically up ending the entire game, but Frontiers does it very well. I did end up paying for a hero but that was only because it looked cool. The hero's being expensive is the only problem for this game and I hope they release a multi hero discount pack like previously.

thing, same, I enjoy the game but I think it's sort of the same thing as the original but slightly harder
game, great, A great TD game. You can tell its made with love and commitment
browser, free, Just play the free browser version, you get nothing extra for paying for this, the content you can't get in the browser version is locked behind a pay wall of $50.
game, first, I really enjoyed the first game and this is just as good :)
games, different, I dont know if it's me getting older and playing different games but I think the original was better
game, mobile, More of the same, which is good. Probably my favourite mobile game franchise, really one of the few worth playing.

coin, much, This game is ridiculously unbalanced. It's cool there is no pay to play, can play offline. But, the game itself is ridiculously unbalanced, as far as how much coin you get per kill, the sheer amount of enemies per wave (even on the easiest setting) the upgrading system. The upgrading system is based on stars, 3 stars if you did well, 2 and 1 stars if not, you can get 5 stars per level, problem is you hit level 6 and hit a literal wall with the enemy type and number and slow upgrading.

level, final, If you like Kingdom Rush, then here's more of it. However, although you pay for the app, there are still in-app purchases. If you're good enough at the game you can beat almost all of the levels, however, the final level in the story is nearly impossible without at least one IAP. Considering that I paid for the game already, I'd hoped that it would be able to be completed without locking the "final" level behind a secret pay wall. Very disappointed.

difficulty, veteran, Kingdom rush is one of the best tower defense games I have come across. I love the challenge of playing on veteran difficulty and trying to figure out a strategy to beat the tough levels but beginners could have fun too on easier game modes. I love how you get to choose which upgrade path to choose for each tower, based on preference of what suits the level.

items, special, This is a peace of shift app. Even after paying for it, it gets so hard that after the 4 or 5 maps you have to pay for special items wich cost gems. Gems are so hard to get you can never have enough unless you buy them wich make this game pay to play which they clam not to be. Fork you Ironhide Games. Uninstaled in less than a day and demanding my money back. You may have mad 2 bucks off me but you won't get a cent more and others will be warned.

game, offline, Pay to win. I purchased this game because it was advertised as an offline game on Google play store. Turns out it's just another pay to win game and you will need to fork out LOTS! To put it in perspective, a big Mac in South Africa costs R38, a vault of gems in this game costs 860 and it may not even be enough. I understand the concept of pay to win, but you will be paying A LOT to win! It's trickery from both the game company and Google play. At least advertise what the game really cost.

games, best, One of the best TD games I've ever played. Classic.
game, Great, Great TD game
fun, super, This game is awesome! It's super fun to play, its challenging, theres a lot of levels but sometimes the game gets to hard
plays, many, Easy to play yet complex and satisfying, rewarding many plays
data, old, Well I lose my old data but at least the char I purchased is still there
levels, first, It's pretty good for the first three levels I've played so far
fun, much, This game is so much fun but the levels get really hard that their almost impossible to win but their still duable
game, great, Just fun and great game all I got to say
flaw, Only, One of the best in the series . Only flaw is that its tweaked just enough to be pay fo play
game, Fabulous, Fabulous game!
game, greatest, This is -- hands down -- the greatest phone game out there. It is both intense and relaxing at the same time, has 0 ads, and doesn't constantly ask you for money. I have loved this series since I first played it on the computer when I was 14, and ten years later I am still playing it on my phone. I have never met anyone who doesn't like this game after trying it for just 5 minutes. I would give this game 10 stars if I could.

game, best, This is the best tower defence game by far. Challenging, but not so much that you'll need to constantly buy premium stuff. Most upgrades are simply available by playing levels and you'll need to play some of them a few times until you get your strategy right to progress or access the bonus levels. 10/10

problem, only, Oh my holy lord... My only problem is the spawners. (Sand wraith)(blood trickster) enemies that spawn enemies with crazy health and damage, the spawners themselves have crazy health and ranged damage. They make this game so infuriating to play. I have beat every single other game on veteran without the purchased items. The blood trickster is the main problem. The axe thrower silence targets the first enemy instead of spellcasters, so the tricksters never get silenced. Otherwise great but annoyin

soooo, good, It's soooo good to play! Just you need to pay to buy the hero.. I'm just like what?! It's not to expensive..so I'm okay with that.. But to me it's so good to play since I have play classic kingdom rush! 👍🎉😊

stages, first, All of these games from this company are nearly the same, the first 2-4 stages are easy but then the difficulty increases way higher then the player can handle without paying for items. I can't even get past stage 5 without paying for anything even after I tried different strats, lowered from normal to easy (which barely did anything), and tried different upgrades. This game is not what I expected from a game I had to pay for, it feels like they just slapped a price tag on a F2P game.

rush, free, I played the free Kingdom rush and decided to try this. It is a great game; interesting towers and you now need multiple types to win. If without the Google play pass, certain heroes are locked...

pay, Absolute, Absolute pay to win trash game. They made dusk chateau the hardest level in the game by spamming too many high level enemies to the point where you need to buy powerups which you can buy with real money.The devs honestly need to get off their asses and tell everyone the truth that this game is pay to win trash. The devs never play tested all the levels to see if they can be beat without powerups because they know you can't. Ironhide studios is trash.

heroes, best, Very nice, though the heroes are a little expensive. You don't need them to play though, one of the best heroes in the game is free.

Can't wait for the next one/new updates.

version, free, Would give 4.5 stars, visually it comes closest to the free version however its the hardest in the series. Some towers are too weak.
game, good, I honestly haven't found a game this good and consumer friendly as a phone app before. Most apps have either tons of ads or slow your progression to get you to buy boosters.

games, other, I enjoy the other Kingdom Rush games but stay far away from this one. The other ones can be played and beaten without spending a single gem. This one focuses more on spending gems to beat levels.

defense, great, Game used to be a great tower defense. But the hero system is a crazy expensive pay to win cash grab and its seems like it has been re-balanced to make the spending of gems necessary.

level, 2nd, Too difficult to play-if you can't get past the 2nd or 3rd level on casual(THE EASIEST LEVEL IN THE OPTIONS MENU...) , then it defeats the purpose. I can't learn how to play if I'm constantly dying. The details are so small that tapping usually fires outside where intended. Leveling up is too difficult. Not enough boost per level up keeps the enemies strong and the heroes weak. It has potential, but not as is. Added 1 star for Play Pass availability - so without would have gotten 0 stars.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, nice graphics and hidden features. I don't believe it is 'pay to win' like some people are saying, just that some levels quite challenging.

one, first, The first one struck a good balance between difficulty and fun. It became a little much in the higher levels without making purchases but they have to make their money somewhere. I purchased this one and the difficulty was a little much right off the bat.
