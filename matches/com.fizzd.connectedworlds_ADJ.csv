game, great, It's a great game.
games, many, I played many rhythm-games like Muse Dash, Stepmania, Tiles Hop, Love Live. This one is VERY unsimilar - I can't pass even a first world! Can't say why it is so difficult for me, even if I'm quite good in rhythm-games which I mentioned before. Strange experience for sure.

tile, last, I noticed in PA-X, on the last mid-spin tile in the level, that the wrong texture was used or at least shown to where it showed a U-turn tile instead.

reason, only, Game is super cool but the only reason why I got it for my phone was so I could play level 10 but you cant play it before beating level 8 & 9 which is super stupid because it isn't like that on pc either. Never played level 9 before and it is super hard. You should change it so that a player can choose which level they want to play regardless of the other levels. This is stupid

game, great, I am good at rythm games, this is a great rythm game, but it is also harder then other rythm games I've played. Thats what makes this game lovable for me :) I recommend you to get it

game, Great, Great game, have it on PC and wanted it here, sadly you can't play the last extra world, World XT, or "options" as I like to call it. Can't wait to have the muse dash songs here though!

levels, own, This game is awesome! The levels are suspenseful, and fun, the art is amazing, and just the visuals are phenomenal! But, I kinda wish you can make your own levels, and export some of the music from your device files/songs.
world, 3rd, 3rd world is off beat
game, Nice, Nice game
Way, difficult, Way too difficult to calibrate. Instructions aren't clear, and no matter how on beat or off beat I am, the game keeps giving me inconsistencies. Incredibly frustrating.
game, Cool, Cool game but the inability to practice certain sections made me refund it. I spent way too long getting to one part of a song before dying to it again and again learning nothing. Just because you have a cool looking rythm game doesn't mean you can omit features every other rythm game has.

game, simple, Very fun and simple game

idea, simplistic, Probably the most simplistic idea for a rhythm game imaginable, and yet it manages to still maintain so much content because of how difficult it gets with later levels. Definitely my favorite rhythm game of all time. After buying this version, I ended up getting the steam version as well for $6, and that one has the option of creating your own levels; or playing some of the 10,000s of online levels. The PC version is far better control wise, but mobile is still very much playable.

lag, input, please add fps options in the settings. The input lag is terrible and it makes the game annoyingly hard to play. Calibration in the settings doesn't really match with the gameplay. Maybe I expected too much from it.. it's very different compared to the Steam version.
days, few, Really love the game and the progression. Been at it for a few days now. Songs are noce and catchy.
calibration, audio, I played the web version first so I already know how it plays, and its great. Its a beauty to look at, it has tutorials and audio calibration is a must cause my audio offset from my phone speakers to Bluetooth head phones are MASSIVE (600ms difference). Also da game runs snooth so thats cool.
rhythm, mobile, If you make the custom maps avaliable, this game will be best mobile rhythm game ever

concept, Easy, Easy concept to understand, and very fun!
level, more, The more level there is, the more I realize that I'm bad at rhytm.. Superb song though and I think it's a bit easier, like the error margin is more tolerant than it used to be, so I think it can be enjoyed better for people like me XD
screen, flat, Pushing buttons > tapping on flat screen
lol, beat, I love the game ❤ Just hard for me to calibrate cause I can't hold a beat lol

level, first, Love the idea of this game but doesn't seem to work on mobile. I can calibrate fine but after about 80% of the first level it just stops registering my inputs and I lose on the simple section. Unless I can find a fix soon I will have to refund

game, Great, Great game, love the simplistic design! The only problem with the mobile version is that the screen is too small, it would definitely be an improvement if they zoomed in. Overall reccomend ADOFAI on PC, but it remains a beautiful and entertaining game nonetheless!

thing, simalar, Hey, i downloaded this on the 8th and its been not working since. I waited all of this time because i was not sure what to do Then i decided to try to get a refund This simalar thing happened with another game i bought and downloaded the game was called hiveswap and i waited a clouple weeks thinking that it needed time to render that i bought it and downloaded it. And it worked. Thats what i thought the same rules applied with this game and i guess not. The thing is, i want a refund if possible.

bread, extra, I need to dive right in to this, in a compliment sandwich. With extra bread. This game is really smooth. I downloaded it on mobile and it is worth the money.Though, adding a level editor would be nice. I love the simple, easy to understand plot. It basically has you as god, controlling two planets in the rhythm of a song. And if you're broke, you can just go on your web browser and search up the best game, A Dance of Fire and Ice, and click on the itch.io build since Steam costs money.

play, broken, Beautiful, calming and yet still challenging. 5 stars for this And wasted 1 hour fixing this broken play store thingey and buying this game was worth it.
games, best, This game is one of the best rhythm games I have ever played. The music is catchy and the level graphics are amazing and still well optimized. The concept is an amazing idea and was executed excellently. The balancing on the levels is decent, and the levels are lots of fun to play and unique in their own way. This is a rhythm game for beginners, but not a beginner's rhythm game. Looking forward to the addition of the level editor on the mobile version!

game, worst, This might be the worst rhythm game I've ever played. I tried calibrating it over and over so I can only conclude that the game intends to punish you for actually staying on beat, so you might as well play it on mute which just makes it a subpar one button game with no purpose

music, amazing, amazing music game
way, Great, Great way of improving your timing, rhythm and response. Love this game
control, simple, Like the warning said, this game is very reliant on rhythm and keeping the beat. That being said, it's a game that have a simple control or gameplay, but really hard to master, at least for me. It is my first time buying a game. Definitely, worth my money. I'm going to stay with this game so my sense of rhythm can be corrected. Hehe.

ones, other, I wish you didn't have to complete the levels before you can play the other ones and you can just play whatever one you want at anytime
level, whole, F*****g dev. The game is extremely challanging and great to play but please!!! put a CHECK POINT in every 30%-50% of the level and in every song!!!. I give a star because it's frustrating to repeat the whole level when the mistake happen at 80% and above. Not everyone can play like a pro. Fix this on the next update. Don't let our purchase go to waste if u didn't do anything with our review.

I try and tap to the rythm and it says let's just go with the original game settings and won't calibrate. I try and tap to the rhythm and it won't do it. If I follow it visually I can get to 40% of the first level but then I am not taping in rythm to the music at all I am just following the visual squares so I don't die. I can not get past 40% on the first level. This game is impossible. Don't waste your time.

game, Awesome, Awesome rhythm game, 10/10 recommend
song, whole, Nice and freaking challanging at some level. But it will be 5 star if dev make a checkpoint every 20%-30% of the progress. It's frustrating to repeat the whole song when it come to a miss/late tapping at 90% or above. Hope dev can fix this on the next update. Realy love this game anyway.

media, social, Phew! I first thought it was simple when I saw it on social media where influencer plays it, it looks real simple! But after I downloaded it, and experienced, it was extremely interesting and unexpectedly hard. For me, it really is an interesting game and helps you to get the beat well. I highly recommend playing this game!

game, perfect, This game is really fun! It's the perfect pocket rhythm game when games like Phigros and DEEMO are getting a tad boring, and also perfect for people just getting into the rhythm game genre.. I've personally been playing this game competitively on speedrun leaderboards but it's also a nice game to just relax and play when you're bored or just feel like tapping your screen to the rhythm

issue, only, As a rhythm gamer for over 20 years (since the Beatmania Complete Mix days), this is such a fun and challenging rhythm game! My only issue is that the sound level for some songs is too quiet and I wish there was a way to normalize then.

stages, final, The game is simple, it may not look that interesting until you actually play it, which totally blew my mind when I did. How hard could a game with 2 orbs spinning around be? It starts off easy to get players into the game, but the final stages especially the challenges are very difficult. Amazing high quality music and aesthetic level design. As a person who has been playing rhythm games for years, I would say it's one of the best rhythm games out there! Overall, spectacular game!

screen, black, Why It only shows black screen when i opened it? I want to continue on level 4 after playing the demo on browser.plss fix it. Thank you
game, Great, Great rhythm game if you wanna get frustrated really fast. Took a little while to properly calibrate though.

lightning, same, Captures the same "lightning in a bottle" that geometry dash did back in the day.
beat, good, Love the game, it has some good beat and is great to play on a break.
game, based, I like rythm based game
game, Good, Pc ver better, add custom maps and I will still give 4 stars cause pc is better. Good game though.
version, mobile, I LOVED IT, it gets my adrenaline pumping because of how ridicoulusly fun it is. I'm considering to purchase the PC version so I can play the custom levels too as I've finished this mobile version. I just think maybe it'd be nice if there was also custom levels like in PC and/or if there's an option to make like an account to link it with the PC version too. The bad reviews here are all ridiculous, because you can recallibrate and I can play Heracles blindfolded so it's not too hard either.

playing, general, As someone w/ years of general Rhythm Game playing and high level Mania 4k and CH experience, I can confidently say this is an amazingly put together rhythm game. The music is all original (and very high quality) and it's simple to learn, while also having an astronomical skill ceiling. My only real issue is that touch inputs on phones are notoriously laggy (usually 200ms+) which can make the game very awkward to adjust to at first, as you often need to tap a frame or 2 earlier than you'd think.

game, excellent, I would love to have the steam mods here, excellent game btw
TIME, SINGLE, 3-X is impossible 81% EVERY SINGLE TIME i hatr this!
design, Great, Great design but missing some big QoL features. I have no idea what the timing is on 2-x's middle section. There is no practice or demo mode so you're SOL if you want to understand your mistakes better. Maybe phones aren't for rythm games. What's with this calibration thing anyways?

game, good, The game is a pretty good rhythm game and I'd say it worth the money.
barrier, low, Bought it on PC and played it there for about an hour or so first, bought it here next just so I can play it on the go. Deceptively difficult, with a low barrier to entry, this is a very fun rhythm game that I'll be burning many hours on!

song, final, Please out check points on the final song of world 6. Or at least let me unlock world 12. That's my favorite one
games, favorite, This is by far one of my favorite rhythm games. I found it on tiktok, bought it on steam and now I'm on the phone. Even my 4 yr old and 6 yr old are addicted.
tiles, invisible, You dont get guidance for invisible tiles like on the steam version but it's still a really fun game! Correction: just turn the graphics up 😅

thing, only, This game is great. For me, the only thing lacking in this game is saving progress online, custom level and custom songs. I wish this game had an account to be able to save progress online.
games, best, Definitely one of the best rhythm games out! Simple yet challenging.
price, Good, Fun rythm game. Good price
time, same, Great and terrible at the same time I can't put it down
game, best, I love this game it's the best rythm game for mobile it can be hard sometimes but it's still fun
bit, little, Updated Review as the problem was solved. A dance of fire and ice is honestly a game one should get if they even have a little bit of intrest in rhythm games. The only thing lacking in this, is custom songs but that's not really needed to enjoy the game fully. Beautiful sound and design

controls, simple, Fun and simple controls. Love this game.
game, fun, A very fun game that i was shown like 2 minutes ago and am now addicted to. If you like Geometry Dash you'll love this game
part, actual, The levels are very off timing no matter how much you calibrate. The game seemed fun until I raised how poor the actual rhythm part of it was. A for effort. D- For the assignment.
game, good, Very good game! The first 5 worlds are quite fun and have just the right amount of challenge, and the extra's level was extremely difficult but had checkpoints every 15-25%, which was extremely nice! And then world 6 happened. I have over 50 tries on world 6 alone, and I'm not even past 30% done with the final level of that. What ever happened to the steady difficulty curve? And it only gets harder from there. If there was an option to have checkpoints every 20% that would be extremely helpful.

game, good, Really love this game more then my ex but besides that it's a really good game if you like rhythm games
calibration, audio, Fun game, but the audio calibration for my headphones doesn't work despite vert consistent input from my end, so I can only use it without headphone.

game, Good, Good game
levels, longer, I love it. I saw it on tiktok and bought it. I enjoy it overall but I'm kinda disappointed that there aren't any checkpoints, especially on longer levels.
way, good, Honestly, found this game through a tiktok showing it played on PC. Blew my mind I had to try it. It really rewrites how you mind thinks about matching rhythm in a good way!
worlds, more, 1. Download the game 2. Beat worlds 1-9 3. Speed trial worlds 1-6 4. Rage because you cant beat anymore worlds 5. Beat World 10 6. Still rage 7. Throw your phone and almost break it. 8. Try to beat more worlds 9. Repeat 6-8 until you cry 9/10 Very fun

part, most, This game is very good for the most part, there are a few things needed in my opinion, such as a practice mode as if you keep messing up on one part at the end of a long sequence you have to redo the entire song just to mess up again.

game, great, I think this is a great game! I notice I have to calibrate kinda often while having a session but I don't mind that too much. What would take it to 5 stars for me is maybe a built in screen recorder because I'd love to share my perfect runs with my friends!

times, several, While this game has made me throw my phone across my room several times, I have to agree that it's really fun and addictive. I think the 2 dollars were worth it! Update: When I tried to play this game three days after downloading it the screen was just black even though I closed it and reopened it about five times. When I uninstalled it then reinstalled it, my entirw progress was deleted and I had to start over. I didnt really mind as I still liked the game but the screen turned black again.
song, final, Honestly terrible if you ask me, you only get to calibrate once so if you mess it up may as well kiss this game goodbye. Also, I honestly hate how the screen transitions so suddenly in a few of the songs. Mainly in the final song of world two. I am frustrated beyond belief since I've been stuck on world 2's final song for maybe 30 minutes now. I think I'll just stick to a steam rythm game instead.

play, Great, Great game play but there are tiny little features missing that can make it frustrating to play. Checkpoints for longer stages and a practice mode would take this to a 5 for sure. It's annoying to keep messing up on a key part late in a long stage

game, Great, Great rhythm game
music, Great, This game is great! It seems simple at first but picks up the pace quite fast. Great music and very addicting.
levels, later, The game is really good and looks fun to play especially in later levels but the HUGE issue I'm having is that I can't calibrate it. If I try calibrating it then the whole game is offbeat by a whole note and just won't let me have it any other way, I can play it on the notes if I keep the default calibration but then the problem is that I have to click just a little off beat every time if I wanna be able to play at all. Please fix this or tell me how to, I r e a l l y wanna play

game, tough, Damn tough game but incredible so far!
games, older, unlike a lot of rythym games, because of the calibration, i actually can play to the beat. most of the older games are off by a few seconds, but this one is amazingly accurate

impression, bad, 8 hours deep now and I love the pain! Stages 3 & 6 give a bad impression on the difficulty by being overly long and uninteresting musically, but 7-11 are some of the finest pieces of rhythm gaming I've played in years. The jazzier, off-tempo instrumentals lend themselves really well to the tile-based system, with the bass drum on later electronic tracks driving behind every note tapped. It really builds into a fantastic game. Don't let 6-X ruin that!

games, best, One of the best rythym games on Android, hands down. If you're into games like this then you'll love this one. Absolutely addicting as hell and just a joy to play. Just goes to show how much more important the actual gameplay is in a game, than it's graphics are. Props to the developer(s). Awesome job!!

cost, great, I love EVERY minute of this. It is so fleshed out, even though it has a one button control. Amazing for a great cost. Edit: After all of the updates, this game is even BETTER than the original version, with new free content being added once in a while. It adds a lot of challenge, but it is VERY worth it. Amazing rhythm gameplay for a low cost, and its got a great difficulty curve, I recommend it 100%.

game, charming, A charming, wonderful one-button rhythm game I have adored ever since it was just a finished proof-of-concept. You will move your way through many well-crafted stages with custom music and heaps of love, all with the brutal unforgivingness that makes it all the more worth it. Ever since the full release, the game is beautiful whose graphics complement the experience with so much room for creativity and expression. I love this game. I even have it on Steam too! Much love from the UKSRT folks!

theory, musical, Great Rhythm game. I've been playing it for quite sometime on both my cellphone and PC. This game was developed by a company that understands musical theory and how to turn it on its head. I cant wait for their next game Rhythm Doctor to finally get its release. Keep it up.

track, full, If you like rhythm games, you will love this! Simple and executed fantastically. I haven't enjoyed a rhythm game this much since Cytus. I love that you can speed up the tracks to really test your limits. It adds the sense that you can always do better which is great for replayability. The training levels before the full "boss track" is a nice touch and the music itself is enjoyable to listen to, especially towards the end. The final track genuinely feels like a reward! Really great job :)

game, wonderful, An absolutely wonderful game that achieves everything it sets out to be - a simple, yet challenging rhythm game. Due to the controls being so simple, it doesn't fall into the problem that most other mobile rhythm games have, which is being harder to play on a smaller screen. A Dance of Fire and Ice plays wonderfully on any device that can run it. The gameplay paired with equally fantastic music and surprisingly engaging custom visuals for each level makes the price tag absolutely worth it. 5/5.

game, Amazing, Amazing game but I have just 1 request, please add the ability to make a custom level like in the PC version, thanks for your time :D
levels, own, The game is fun and all but im giving it 3 stars because you cant create your own levels
game, Great, Great game! Owned it on PC and loved it!
charts, top, Easy to pick up hard to master, after being tired of the top rhythm game charts being filled with nothing but clones of the same 3 games it's refreshing to have something actually engaging which doesn't bombard you with advertising every 30 or so seconds. I reccomend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of rhythm games, if they have somehow not heard of it already.

game, Good, Good game. Is fun
game, Great, Great game! It would be great if there was a "practice mode" like in Beat Saber or guitar hero. A mode where you can start from a specific place, no-fail enabled and the option to reduce speed. Unrelated: Whoever made level 9. Please more of that!

graphics, Great, Very fun!! Great graphics and gameplay... well worth the $$$.
ones, newer, I remember when this was first on Kongregate. I was first to comment, iirc... still love it to this day! Edit: It's great to see the game come so far! The levels are beautiful and the newer ones are the perfect amount of challenging.

button, single, I have this game on PC too, and the simple single button control-style lends itself to any platform very well. Catchy music, fun visuals, and a new way of presenting music theory and patterns to those who aren't musically-inclined.

game, fun, Originally I finished this on steam. Its very addictive that I had to buy it for my phone too, and it works no differently to the pc version A fun Rhythm game.
games, other, This game is amazing! If you like games like osu! or other rythm games you're going to love this one, its simple to play but hard to master, the original music its super catchy and perfect for the gameplay, i would also recommend this game if you are a musician. I bought it twice cause its also available for pc. Im super happy I saw that tokaku and miraie video about this game. Love it!

game, fun, This game is a very fun and challenging rhythm game! The concept of the game is very simple while giving you a very easy "just tap to the beat" type of gameplay. It does a very good job at expanding on how to play while increasing the difficulty. I highly recommend you play this game!

mechanics, simple, Very simple game mechanics, which gets quite challenging in later levels. I had no Lags whatsoever on my OP3, which is critical for a good expirience. No ads, just the game. Can recommend! I also tried the online Demo of "Rhythm Doctor", which i can also recommend. It's also a Single Button Rhythm game, but with completely different mechanics.

game, fun, Incredibly fun rhythm game, really provided a challenge, but was never too infuriating. Also, the input delay can be calibrated, so it means I can play with Bluetooth headphones connected, which really improves the game, because I can now play when out and about.
spike, Severe, Severe difficulty spike after 5-x, but other than that love your game! Love the aesthetic and the music. First time I was interested in playing a rhythm game. Sometimes I get angry because I cant hear the beat because it faded into the background. This game is an absolute steal for $2 Cheers, Donovan

fun, much, I like how much fun it is. It's a great game for a lot of people. Sime levels are so much fun like 4-X. Just some levels are just plain hard and not fun to play. (Specifically 3-X) Other than that it's a great game

point, certain, Pretty good up until a certain point where the tutorial does not really give you a good sense of each unique mechanic. World five in particular is kind of where it drops off at and where you will find yourself repeating the previous tutorial levels. Overall a pretty good game but could use some polishing up.

game, Wonderful, Wonderful game! I love the concept of using angles to represent beats, and I enjoyed it very much. The graphical options are appreciated, as are the new levels that are being added in updates! This game is a definite 5/5 for me. Thank you, everyone on the dev team. Highly recommended. P.S. My heart was beating out of my chest during the 6-X speed trial, lol. Took me a while but I did it!

iffy, little, Updated! The Good: As a rhythm game, the concept is neat, the execution is very good, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The visualization of percussion and beats was refreshing. The Bad: The calibration is still a little iffy, in my experience. The Ugly: Nothing, really. Previously, this paid app was the same as its free browser counterpart, but with updates to graphics and several additional worlds, it's well worth the $3 I spent for it years ago. It's been a joy revisiting this masterpiece!

work, Good, Good work on the fixes. I saw the changes and im glad, especially with the new levels coming in. I also have the pc version and with that said if its not too much to ask, will we ever get the ability to play custom maps in here? I mean its okay if we cant make our own custom levels here but being able to play custom maps here would be amazing.

time, third, This is my third time playing through this game. It is a phenomenal rhythm game with amazing, and unique music as well as a creative but easy to understand concept. The graphics are a little downgraded compared to the computer version but that's to be expected I think, the game still looks wonderful and keeps essentially all of its charm.

game, Amazing, Amazing game. love it.
users, mobile, The game is fabulous on steam. love the music. love the gameplay. I thought it would be amazing to have it on my phone. However, it's obvious that the developer have made no effort on optimising the game for mobile users. The game is lag af and unplayable on my phone (Huawei p20 lite). I hope this could be improved. until then.
progress, last, Really good. Could be better if it had an exit button and if it remembered last progress so one can continue without having to manually skip tutorials. Also, a wonderful feature would be to have the initial beat of the level continue after failing, so one can seamlessly restart the level into that beat. Ending the audio abruptly upon failing is very anticlimactic. Same for the menu music that ends abruptly when entering the settings - at least fade it out!

game, hard, simple but fun! (i would consider it a hard game) nice, that there are new levels, keep it up! to Devs: i find myself playing the game only orientating with hearing because video ist sometimes a bit laggy. how about coloring the floor green or red depending on hitting perfect / too late/... (different colors for early and late!!)

pity, real, Absolutely love this game, and it just so happens that I'm a drummer too. I'm addicted to it! A real pity that it's so short though. Would've loved it even more if it had some endless mode etc. Just 3 suggestions for the game. One, there's no orientation change even when rotating the phone. Please implement this! Two, an option to disable haptic feedback would be nice. Maybe change it to a sound instead too. Three, my 'worlds' all have accuracy over 100%. Not sure if it's a bug? Thank you!

fan, huge, I am a huge fan. I will buy this game on every platform.
game, Amazing, Amazing game, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, World #3, Level X is currently broken for me (Love Letters) - at about 19%-20%, when the screen flashes and the base kicks in, instead of proceeding with the beat, the spheres stay in one place and on the next beat you lose. I've tried this level about 20 times and I'm pretty sure it's a bug (Samsung S7 with Android 8.0 and build 1.0.5 ~ r15). Please fix this!

stars, full, Now my lag issue has been resolved (really fast and helpful answer!), i can give it the full 5 stars it earns. (for everyone else who has a lag problem: try increasing the offset by ~0.20. Bluetooth speakers might be the cause of it lagging)
beats, catchy, Love the game. Very catchy beats that have a natural flow and would be easy to tap along to even if it wasn't the core mechanic of the game.

game, best, I absolutely love it, really addicting game! One of the best rhythm game I have ever played, I'm waiting for new updates to come, in the mean time I am stuck at 3-X (1.1x). Can you add like maybe easy mode or something? because it gets really challenging. other than that, fun experience. 6/5

game, great, A really great, absorbing game. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to break the long, hard levels into practice chunks. There are areas in the long levels that require a certain amount of repetitive practice to internalize the rhythm, but playing over the entire level to get to that point causes finger fatigue, which makes any kind of repetitive practice both difficult and painful.

mechanic, Clever, I have deleted all the others.   Clever mechanic and visuals. Fun and addictive, great to share with people. frustrating enough to keep you playing and fun enough/ enough of a skill barrier to keep you coming back.   any time i need a 5-10 min break this is the only game I need.

levels, more, A rhythm gamer friend of mine and i played this first on Kongregate and we loved it. I bought it to support the creator and in hopes to get more levels! We bothe also want a level creator/editor. Id love to make my own songs!                                                Edit: its been a while and im sooo looking forward to new content! I was also wondering if, now that the Nintendo 3DS is going to have Unity support, if a verson for it will be created? Edit 2: awesome! Im so excited to see more in this!

game, similar, There's a similar game out called Skyward, and while that has better graphics, I think you have better gameplay here by introducing a rhythm element. That and you don't have ads. It's fun but doesn't look great.  Reply: Dude, getting ratings as high as this with this level of graphics is an achievement. I look forward to seeing the look change. :)

loading, Quick, Quick loading, I instantly starts you over when u fail.  No waiting.... A good reality check for the rhythm impaired

day, bad, I play this game when I have a bad day or struggle with something. It reminds me that there are things in life I am worse at.
game, better, I spent another night looking for a better rhythm game.  A game called Radiohammer looked promising but the controls weren't responsive so it's useless.  If you want an android rhythm game this is it!  God I'm sick of guitar-hero style rhythm games--I played DDR a long time ago and got over it!  Anyway, this Dev is responsive and his appreciation of Rhythm Tengoku (the best rhythm game) shows.  Maybe he'll team up with some other like-minded folks and create a full-fledged game like Rhythm Tengoku?!

buy, Instant, Just playing this game on the web and I fell in love with it. Instant buy when I know that I can play this on my phone
levels, more, Love this game!  It's simple but oh so challenging!  I wish there were more levels!   This game isn't for the faint of heart.  (or people who can't keep a rhythm like me).  There's something so wonderful about this game that keeps me coming back.  FIVE STARS!  Great job.  I'd pay good money if there was a sequel!

thing, best, Fun, addicting, occasionally frustrating, this game is simple and fun to play. If every developer could make these kinds of games for the price range of &lt;$2, they could be the best thing to happen to the app store.
fun, extra, Getting an A on the calibration tool was a bit of extra fun. However I feel that the buttons on the screen could be smaller, and the calibration number a little bigger. Overall it was quite short and I'm looking forward to more worlds or other game modes too.

rhythms, odd, This game is amazing, it takes me back to the days of playing rock band everynight. I like that it's throwing odd rhythms at me that I don't normally hear in music too. My only problem is that I get little lag spikes every once in a while, does anyone know a fix for this? I've tried stopping all background apps and it still happens, just enough lag to mess me up :( Edit: I'm using a galaxy S5 if it helps, also really hoping this gets updated in the future, nice work dev!

game, great, Great on the PC but calibration tool was poor. Cant enjoy an otherwise great game.
times, several, I even had to try the calibration mini-game several times just to prove to myself that I could get an "A"
attention, more, This really deserves more attention; it's very unique and loads of fun. I have encountered lag and audio desynchronisation, but this is only because I'm using an older device, so it's to be expected.

feature, new, I love it, the new calibration feature makes it a lot easier/fairer (although it may just be covering up my lack of rhythm :p)
attention, more, This game deserves much more attention then its getting!
music, Great, Great music, a fast pace and lots of fun, which makes it easy to get drawn in.   Had enough fun for it to be an easy 5 stars to give, but this game clearly has lots more potential for future updates.  Best 60p spent on an app in a long time.
