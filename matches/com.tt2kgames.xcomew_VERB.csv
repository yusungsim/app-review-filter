play, on, pc, Even though this was a good game to play on the pc and console, the problems with this game is you need some serious mobile hardware to play this. When i was playing this cutscenes were fine however at some points the game was crashing or other times stalling from granade explosions. The game was also crashing at random when i was just in the xcom hq managing things.

had, for, ages, I've had this for ages, and I'm playing through again on a tablet, which is going pretty well. A few odd glitches but overall still a great game. But I actually came here to explain to others that even though I also get the "no Google account" error, it's simply that it's trying to connect to Google+, bless its heart. Turns out that it still saves on the device itself just fine if I select a spot to save and hit "next." I do wish the devs would break the news about Google+ to it, though.

cloud, to, Google+, Tries to cloud save to Google+, which predictably fails, given that it hasn't existed for 2.5 years now. Misregisters the location of your touches so you have to tap sightly above buttons, and you get stuck in one demo level because you can neither shoot or cancel your action. I'm sure it's a great game but it's been abandoned for years and is approaching unsupported obsolescence.

connect, to, account, Unable to connect to Google account. So I'm unable to save my game. This needs to be fixed
Seems, for, port, Honestly why does it need to access contacts, phone history, etc. Seems pretty predatory for an old XCOM port.
paying, for, this, Fun game but has been abandoned by the devs for another version. Avoid paying money for this as crashes are frequent due to lack of updates to current mobile devices.
logged, into, Play, As stated by others, even though I'm properly logged into Google Play, the game will not save on my Android 9 device. Also, it does not properly center on my screen and the button presses must be a little above each button. Epic fail... Got a refund within a few minutes of testing the game.

running, on, Android, Can't believe it this awe game running on Android 😲
run, on, phones, The game is great, but will there be any updates? More maps? Maybe some of the DLC's? Updated graphics? Even if I had to pay again, that would be nice for those who can't run Xcom 2 on their phones and being fair, this port doesn't really hold in 2021.

beat, on, breaks, Loved it soooo much, nothing but positive vibes. Thanks for allowing me to beat this game on breaks and lunches
opted, for, phone, Overall great game. The only problem is the game is opted for a lower quality phone so sometimes the game will freeze then crash if you have a higher quality phone. The graphics look very poor and there's no way to change that in the settings

log, into, play, I really want to play but I can log into Google play, so you can't save...
Played, on, PC, Played on PC however playing on android devices has issues on certain phone's. Using a Samsung A2core octa core and 1 gb ram and game will boot and run opening cut scene perfectly until loading first level then hard crash closing the game. Given the game a 5 star because the game is fantastic just a shame I can't play it on this handset.

downloads, from, store, App downloads from the store but when I launch it I get an error saying download failed and the game exits.
Avoid, like, plague, Can't even manual local save on device. Also no cloud saves . Avoid this game like the plague , no developer support and last update was over 4 years ago.
reveal, with, Scanner, Like the game, but unfortunately, it seems to freak out and freeze up whenever I reveal a Stalker with a Battle Scanner.
log, into, account, It's a great game but saving is impossible. I can't log into a Google account so my progress is never saved. Worked fine on the last phone had. It's just giving an error message. This game is unplayable without being able to save progress. Skip it until you see reviews saying its been addressed.

crashed, in, row, It crashed too much sometimes 3 to 4 times in a row
using, for, disc, This is a terrific game, especially if you played the old XCOM games using the 3 and 1/2 inch for 5 and 1/4 inch disc. If you download this game, you're going to have a great time.
seems, on, phone, Really decent game. Although on phone it seems a little to "close up" . I assume it wouldn't be so bad on tablet?
Depends, on, device, Depends on your device. Don't run on a 2014 phone.

work, on, Chromebook, Does not work on Chromebook.
optimized, for, mobile, It crashes when trying to load it resume game. It's a fun game but what's the point if you can't beat it. This problem is very common, the game isn't well optimized for mobile.
played, on, ps4, I played this on my ps4 and on phone i like them both
Getting, into, positions, Looks great, controls are glitchy. Getting into elevated positions is iffy at best. It errors when loading or saving because Google+ doesn't exist any longer.
connect, with, saves, Gameplay is quite awesome but left lil bit disappointing because unable to cloud saves using Google Play Games.. Unable to connect with other cloud saves available.. Maybe developer just didn't care about this game anymore..

done, for, phone, Fun game just as I remember well done for the phone
make, to, mobile, Will Xcom 2 ever make the port to mobile?
let, On, Xiaomi, It used to be a good game but it stopped working. On Xiaomi mi 10 miui 12.5 it doesn't let to perform some actions and it is impossible to complete missions.
crashed, during, screen, Game crashed during game booting screen in mi11t pro. Saddd

played, Within, game, I have never played Enemy Within but the base game, I have betten feels good.
crashes, on, phone, I just bought a Samsung Galaxy A12 and was super excited to finally have enough space for XCOM again. Unfortunately it crashes on this phone too I guess. Such a bummer.
beat, in, lmao, This game has so many glitches and crashes all the time. I should be refunded for being able to beat it in its current condition lmao
updated, with, expansions, Great game but it really needs to be updated with some new expansions and experiences for game play.
complaining, about, issue, Only problem is it's a little zoomed in, making it more diffult to plan out an ambush without zooming out over and over. Everyone complaining about the elevation issue there's a camera button with an up and down toggle 🤦. Plays extremely well, only had a few crashea and those were only launching the game not in the middle of a battle. I'm honestly surprised how well This was ported over, and the price?? On steam and Xbox this still runs at $40, but here the exact game is $5. No brainer 💁

selecting, as, position, Overall game is fine, just a little trouble when selecting slove as the end position. Sometimes can't even select the slove (stairs is fine though)

connecting, to, account, Game has trouble connecting to Google account so you can't save your progress. Shame game feels fantastic....even if it was the tutorial...
save, to, phone, Won't save to phone. Chinese game company and Chinese phone(Nubia Red Magic 5G Global-Android 11) and will not save game progress due to write fail. Just fix the write permission, or a redirect flag for the save location.
Works, with, controls, Device: one plus 7 pro The game runs and looks great. Works perfectly with touch controls. Except for the pc this is the best way to play the game. I've had one slight issue where because of my curved screen some UI elements don't quite display right, but it doesn't impact gameplay at all so it's nothing major. I haven't tested controller support but the touch controls work so well that I wouldn't use one anyway, might be worth looking into if you have an android TV though.

load, without, fail, Great game and a good port until you need to load. Mine crashes every time I load the game without fail. I literally can't play unless I want to start from scratch. It's a shame because I was really getting to like my squad.

starting, from, scratch, Crashes on any attempt to save. Get used to seeing "Failed to write save" and starting from scratch. The cloud save and Facebook login aren't compatible with the latest Android. Otherwise a great game but not the type you can play without access to saves. Please fix compatibility issues.

played, after, math, Bought the game, but it just won't install! After downloading 3gigs of data, it says, failed to install! Bought the game cause I have played xcom 2 and UFO after math and after light. This was disappointing. Edit: they fixed the bug, however, after my first session it seems the save file got corrupted, due to which I am unable to load it again. 2-3 hours of game save. At this point I have given up really. Just play it on your system guys, X-com just isn't working out for on the go

involved, at, difficulty, Best strategy game available on android so far ! Great variability , actuall thinking involved at higher difficulty , and has replayability .
porting, to, mobile, Awesome port of an awesome game except they didn't do such an awesome job actually porting the game to mobile. If it would work I'd give it 5 stars and say it's the best game on mobile devices.
paid, for, game, Im annoyed that i paid money for a game that twice now ive had to close before completing the tutorial due to inability to progress.

install, onto, card, I love this game and this is a fairly faithful port of it. I wish I could give it a higher rating but the fact that I can't install it onto my SD card means I can't free up enough space to play it on my new mobile device. I'd love to be able to give it a higher rating.

ending, after, mission, Fantastic game, but I've encountered 3 issues that are a bit annoying. Cloud Save doesn't seem to work, I've had occasional never ending loads after a mission causing me to that progress, and minorly, some crashes continuing a game in progress, resolved by force closing the game and restarting. 4 stars despite those issues.

put, into, versions, I was worried when I read reviews saying you can't climb buildings...you can it's easy....!.. Just slide 2 fingers up or down...noobs!.. Having put hundreds of hours into the PC versions of XCOM and XCOM 2..I can say this mobile version is excellent.. If you love XCOM just get it.. It's XCOM. Five big star's from me.... And We will be watching Commander!..
recommended, for, anyone, Fantastic port of the full game! Brings back all the memories and nostalgia of my early Xcom experiences highly recommended for anyone with an interest in turnbased strategy. Should be mentioned that of course the graphics are lesser than the console or PC versions
play, on, Galaxy, Can't play on Galaxy note 20 ultra

Can't even pass the door. The door seems to black out when I stand directly infront of it. I really hove the developers can help me out as I would love to support any future development. Thanks. I'll give a 5 star once this problem has been rectify.

translating, to, controls, Phenomenal gameplay. It's like digital crack lmao . But the game being this complex I was expecting it translating to TOUCH controls would take some getting used to. And it did. Even still it gets weird on occasion but definitely works well enough to not be too bothersome. I barely notice the jank anymore. Impressive port nonetheless. 👏👏

love, for, reason, I love this game but for some reason I have a Galaxy S9 and every time I try to load up my game it crashes. if I get that fixed I'll gladly raise it up back to five stars!

have, at, times, Is fun to play and easy to get sucked into. A decent port although I don't think it will get a compatibility update with future Android OS systems. Can be buggy and have wonky touch controls at times along with the occasion crash. But still worth me putting 55+ hours into it across multiple playthroughs.

using, on, Pixel, So I'm using this game on a Google Pixel 3a XL with android 11 and latest security updates. It works very well. The only "crash" instance happens if the game is newly loaded and by clicking on the resume game option BEFORE the game has established contact with the Google Play server. Just wait a few seconds until your player level displays and then continue. No other issues. Yes, the game play gets getting used to from a PC and mouse combo, but after a while it works. Good Port.

having, on, mobile, I'm a fan of XCOM on pc and so having it on mobile was an idea I loved. Unfortunately, I can't move any of my squad members to higher elevations, mainly roofs. Using the camera controls to raise the level of the camera still leaves the roof in shadows and tiles can't be selected to move a soldier to. Often times it will just click through the roof and the camera will switch to showing the inside if the building instead. This makes them game much more difficult and no longer play it.

pouring, into, experience, Loved the game on PC, religiously played LW, love the sequel. Huge fan. Why the low score? I just lost half my campaigns save files. No idea how that is possible. It shouldn't be. Same SD card, same everything else. Nothing worse in these kind of strategy games. Could u restart? Yeah, I could. Can I trust that I won't simply be pouring hours into an experience just to have it evaporate yet again? No. I can't. Hard to bring myself to recommend a game with game breaking bugs baked in. Ouch.
runs, on, S9, Has so much potential. The original XCOM games on PC control so well. This doesn't. I can't change the elevation to move troops on or off rooftops using either the two finger method or the on-screen controls. The camera constantly zooms all the way in, as if that's ever what I want it to do. It runs fine on my Galaxy S9 but looks worse than screenshots of the console versions from almost 8 years ago.
stuck, on, rooftops, So glitchy its unplayable. Guys get stuck on rooftops, game freezes, screen text doesnt match the screen. It literally took longer to install this game than i got of actual playing time before uninstall. Very disappointed; been playing x-com since the original.

killed, for, me, Love xcom but this was a bit clunky with the controls, but what killed it for me was when I denied it permission to access my phone and make calls or look at my contacts the game wouldn't launch. Why does xcom a game I paid for need my contracts or make calls. Uninstall this app. Zero stars

seeing, in, phone, Needs an update for modern phones. I am seeing a lot of touch inconsistencies in my phone.
playing, on, classic, I'm playing on classic and I'm glad I didn't turn on Ironman mode. It difficult to navigate the map, I accidentally tap the screen twice and my unit just ran out in the open. Every movement have to be confirm because touchscreen suck. I was trying to see if my soldier can make it to the cover, that mistake cost me a game. Why the game keep zoom in everytime when switching soldier? It doesn't even make sense to do that, I want to get the general view of the battle not a close of a solider.

got, In, past, Very slow download. In the past it got self aborted once the download reach half of it.
target, with, %, Good game...just too many glitches.can hut target with a 43% but not a 98%...your miss shot percentage is overboard while the computer can hit u whenever they want .. Close out at times wont allow certain rules...needs some add ons

crashes, on, galaxy, Constantly crashes on galaxy s21 please refund!
runs, on, phone, Great port runs faster on this phone then ps4, the thing is guys get a 1,000$ or up phone your complaints will cease about lag, crashes, slowdowns, that simple, if you can't afford the phone then this game is not for you.

built, for, version, "This App was built for an older version of Android." I refunded 5min after noticing the app is defective, but Google didn't approve it unfortunately. Such a pity :(
get, to, ground, This game seems phenominal. But the fact that I can't make a soldier do an elevation change with a two finger drag makes me want to do a refund. The tutorial says it should work. My experience with the game says it doesn't. I'm in the second level and I can't make the guy on the roof get to the ground. Nothing works. Seriously, how could you not employ a simple onscreen toggle that lets me change elevations? You broke what could have otherwise been a perfect android port?
xcomming, for, time, More plz. Thank you. Really I don't thank many but thank you. I've been xcomming...for a long time. Can you please release some more? Maybe the next game? Dlc?
looking, for, data, Splendid app really. Thought I was buying xcom port, not xcom live wallpaper saying "looking for data, downloading 0mb/0mb"
played, on, Android, One of the best games I've played on Android. A fantastic port of a fantastic game.
loved, on, console, Great Port - I loved this game on my console, and when I upgraded to a next gen, sadly enemy unknown and the full expansion wasnt available. My first xcom experience was on the good old amiga back when I was in secondary school. The first game where you felt distraught if you soldiers were killed, as you lost them for good. This port brings back all the thrills and tear bringing lows and is a faithful recreation and now I can assume my role as the commander once more, and destroy the grey menace

move, to, levels, A great port from the pc version. Unfortunately however the camera controls are quite annoying and there's no free camera option either, plus when selecting to move to upper or lower levels it can be confusing
wait, for, port, Amazing full port. Really love this game. Can't wait for the next port of XCOM 2!
played, on, P.C., I played this game on P.C. and I am surprised it is also available on smartphone. Nice and fun playing this game.
purchasing, for, those, Wow! Challenging and addictive!!! Be warned, though, the graphics is a space hog requiring over 3G of space! WELL WORTH purchasing for those who enjoy strategy games with plenty of action!

crash, on, own, Love this game. Just like on the console. It will crash on its own sometimes but when I reload it its right where it crashed. Recommend for everyone. Just wish it was longer.

doing, on, Ironman, Incredible port. Unfortunately, I was doing a playthrough on Ironman and the game refused to spawn any bad guys on a level (spoiler) where you can't abort the mission. No save point to go back to to try again. Disappointing. If that got fixed, 5 stars.

updated, for, version, Its good actually, but it needs to be updated for latest android version. Cause it always crash when i play.
work, on, tablet, Does not work on tablet wont even load saying download Failed. Tried to redownload this 5 times.
developed, for, version, The game it's good until crash I really enjoying the game BUT some times it's just close without any error message, just close and I lost my progress... I realized that when I try to sync my save with the cloud, the error also happens. Sometimes when I open the game the following message appears: "This game was developed for previous version of Android" I'm now on Android 10. Please developers make it fully compatible with newer Android.
panning, around, map, Would be great if not for the awful camera controls. This game seems determined to keep you zoomed in so far that you cant see anything, and on top of that is only capable of slowely panning around the map. Most of your time in battle will be spent thumbing around trying to see something that isnt the 10 squares around your soldiers that the game seems to think is all you need
played, for, 2hrs, Game is very fun but I only played for 2hrs because you cannot save the game Tried to load back in today but my save was deleted Keeps saying Cloud Save Not Working please make an update Thank you

work, with, Chromebook, The game pretty much won't work with any Chromebook anymore. That's because if you have a Chromebook, then google keeps updating their android OS, and their latest version of Android has basically broken the game completely.
finished, on, android, I finished this game on psvita years ago. And now just finished it on android. Please release Xcom 2 collection on android. I'll definitely gonna get it!!

updated, for, phones, It need to be updated for newer phones .please update it.
taken, of, that, Pretty decent game. I have problems loading sometimes using resume. Hitting single player seems to have taken care of that. I have XCOM:UFO Defence for PS1 and it's my favorite game all time. This is ok so far, could be better tho. Especially aiming percent algorithms. 80% chance to hit misses at LEAST 50% of the time which makes it very hard to survive an win even on easy mode ( and I have aiming device on them to give an extra 10% ). Your guys get killed because you miss 3 out of 4 80% shots.
wish, to, five, I wish to five a good feedback. I am a follower of pc series. The mobile implementation has 3 problems. Not being able to save between missions. Long time to start playing. It is difficult to be precise when selecting characters.which delays the game agility. Finally, if you leave the app open while doing soemthing else it is going to eat battery and get your mobile warm.

get, past, permissions, It literally won't let me get past app permissions. Won't start at all.
stays, to, original, An excellent port that stays true to the pc original
work, for, phones, Unfortunately doesn't work for new phones, got a new Galaxy S21 and I can't play anymore :( 3 stars because it's still a good game.
crashes, on, S10, Game crashes constantly on my Galaxy S10. I couldn't finish prologue mission because my soldiers didn't have enough AP to move to designated area. What a joke

works, on, tablet, This is my absolute favorite PS3 game. I just got a Galaxy Tab A7 and was shocked to see that there is an Android version, which I decided to buy (because it's my fav). This version works better on the tablet than on the PS3! As I'm playing I keep muttering, "This is so freaking awesome!" If you like this game, don't even hesitate. I personally believe this game is one of the best games EVER made, and the Android version on my tab A7 does not disappoint!
work, for, while, Devs don't keep this updated. Worst part is it does work for a while in new devices but then you can't load games and you already lost the time for a refund. Don't buy unless you have an old phone.

climb, to, position, Its almost impossible to climb to an elevated position. Pls fix it
add, to, it, Please add multi multiplayer to it
zooms, on, dudes, Cloud saves busted. You WILL get a message saying your phone is too new for the game to work correctly. If it does work enough to play, the game zooms in on your dudes when you select them making you take the time to pinch zoom out on every action. This makes the game tedious to play. Requested refund.
take, of, power, This game is so much fun. Yes the graphics take a hit and yes the control can be iffy but its THE FULL GAME. I love it. I would love to see an updateto this so it can take advantage of newer phones power
replaying, for, years, One of the best Android games ever, replaying it for years after purchase. No adds no pay to win. To avoid crashing just let the title video play for a short time before skipping it
Loved, on, xbox, Excellent. Loved this game on the xbox and loving it here too. I could play any xcom game over and over happily, can't wait for the day xcom 2 comes to mobile when the hardware improves.

add, like, mission, Please bring the multiplayer mode back and make the mkbile ver same like the pc. Fpr example, the equipment per soldier, in pc/console ver they have 2 equipment slots, but the mobile only have 1 slots equipment. And the guardian armor that can flying. You only can fly 2 step. And add more event, like train mission, mission on the dam, and that asian guy.
move, by, accident, Pretty solid port the only complaint is just the controls aren't that great. I wish they added controller support like PC. I often move by accident.
play, on, mobile, An incredible experience. XCOM is one of my favourite franchises of all time, and being able to play it on mobile is such an amazing thing. An incredibly faithful and functional port, too. It's truly the full experience on mobile.
played, on, devices, I have played this now on two devices, my galaxy s6 and my n100 smartphone, both run beautifully.
made, on, platform, Still the best turn based tactical game ever made (on any platform).
ported, to, environment, An epic game from the PC that almost perfectly transfers to mobile. Some of the controls can be difficult to use, but it is great to see a fully fledged PC game ported to a mobile environment. Very few tactical turn based squad games compare to this masterpiece.

work, with, update, Cloud saves doesn't work with the March 11 2021 update of Google Play but keeps on asking you to login. No Multiplayer servers are available so it's just a single-player game.
cleared, for, it, Its to big for my internal memory...cant we have a smaller bit and download the rest? I mean i cleared my phone for it 3.2 gb and once the downloads finished it demands additional space its not fair yet i paid for it. The game is fun but im saddened that i cant play what i bought really

seen, on, YouTube, I love this game so far, and it's worth every penny, I would love to see xcom 2 on mobile as well I've seen lots of videos of it on YouTube and I'm loving how it plays. I know it's a bit of a large request but could xcom 2 be put on mobile and someone make mods for the games on mobile plz, also what's up with the multiplayer feature not working on here, it's frustrating to say the least.

effect, to, much, Pretty great port, well worth the 5 dollars. Its got some jank but its a port so thats not surprising, it doesn't effect the gameplay to much. Solid 5 outta 7.
deal, with, chance, Tough game even on easy because you still deal with chance, not sure but even at 95% chance to hit you still will miss a lot, "it's crazy"but not them, I just wish on easy mode it was a more relaxing, because all I want to do is play a game not stress myself out. Just used to save option and you'll be fine.

work, for, me, It used to work really well for me. But it seems the game hasn't been updated in a long time and it works poorly on my new phone. Also the elevation change with two finger swipe seems to completely not work at all and elevation changing is very messy and clunky in general and causes me to be unable to see things I should be able to like what's on the roof.

give, for, fact, Even though I love the series I give this a 4 star for the fact that it refused to download for 3 hours and when I was going to take a video of it for my you tube it was completely removed from my phone so I have to go through the process again by the time you we this edit It got removed which was my phone's fault but it takes so long to download because it refuses for a long time

updated, in, time, Great game but has not been updated in long time so probably won't work much longer... needs update
playing, for, years, I've been playing this game for six years. It's my favorite game. I play it on a tablet, the graphics are just amazing compared to a phone.

speaks, of, condition, Really sorry this game is a menace on touchscreen. Also the density of action speaks of a go robot condition. False devising of distribution with an else fair entertainment.
shoot, like, drop, Wheres the graphic setting?? My device is POCO X3 NFC i think its a good device to play this game.. But why the game still a bitt lag when i play it.. When it walk or shoot like my fps drop so the game a bit lag.. N theres no graphic setting?? Come on dev please help me..
playing, for, years, Been playing on/off for two years now and u must say, its infuriatingly hard and managed to beat the game once and i want to delete it from time to time but something in this game just stops me and keeps me wanting more. Its hard yes but i still love it.

playing, on, redmi, I am playing this game on redmi note 9pro. And while playing suddenly app crashes and you have start the game from beginning. Waste of money.
listen, through, headphones, This is a very good port of XCOM: Enemy Within to Android. Loading times are very fast, graphics are generally clear, the sounds are very good when I listen through headphones, and the gameplay is as difficult and fun as I remember on the Steam version. My only issues have been that sometimes the touch input thinks you want to launch a grenade when you're just trying to move the landing spot a little, and there is a (edge case) AI bug that may cause an infinite loop requiring a force quit.

developed, for, version, The game just displays a message saying it was developed for an older version of android and wont load at all , so basically i paid for a game that i cant even play so beware! Even though im running it on an android flagship phone.

loved, on, pc, So good. So. So good. I loved it on pc and its perfect for tablet. I can't think of a game better suited for mobile devices. Perfection. And a bargain too.

getting, across, map, Great game, almost identical to the pc and console version. Perfect game for mobile, gameplay A+. One thing that would improve the interface is adjustable scroll speed for getting across the map, otherwise flawless
comimg, to, game, 30fps lock?!? Fix that ASAP devs! I have 144hz screen so comimg to this game always feels so slow and laggy. An awfull experience. What a shame... Otherwise an awesome game! Definitely my all time favourite mobile game! 6/5❤️
Play, at, %, Play store installation failure at about 40%. This is my Nth attempt and still no bacon.
r.2012, na, PC, Hra r.2012 na PC a hra roku na Android do teraz..pretože stále od vydania pre mobily (r.2014) nemá konkurenciu na Android, iOS a na PC mu konkuruje iba XCOM 2 ..nehladte na cenu je to TOP a na rozdiel od hack & crack je aktualizovaná + stiahne sa verzia pre váš model mobilu. Ide skvele aj na Acer z630 (low end) aj na Galaxy Note 4 (hight end) samozrejme iná verzia pre model aj inak vyzerá. Na Note 4 je to nádhera, na Acer je hra len pekná. Je to skutočná kvalita PC titulu ktorá nie je oproti PC verzie okrem grafiky a pár micro DLC odsekana. Je to 100% klon a už len dùfat že raz aj vyjde do mobilou kompletný XCOM 2. Nemusíte sa báť ovládania - je to skôr pre väčšie mobily, alebo tablety..

Toned, from, version, Good strategy game. Toned down from PC version but still fun to play. Pray to your RnG god/s before downloading

stuck, at, mission, The game stuck at the first mission. I'm suppose to lunch a rocket but it doesn't work when I press accept and I can't do any other action.
feels, after, while, Good, but feels repetitive after a while.
run, on, my, Just bought the game last month... Absolutely LOVE it.. The game run smoothly on my Galaxy Tab A. Highly recommend this game to avid X-Com fans or strategy games fans. Really disappointed when Operation Slingshot and Progeny were omitted from the android version. Still I rated this game 10/10

Played, for, all, Broken. Played for all of 5 minutes before I was unable to carry out any actions with my squad. Reloaded, same issue. Shame as I love the Xcom games and was happy to pay to play it on my phone. Total waste of money

cloud, on, galaxy, Would be 5 stars if I could do cloud saves on my galaxy tab a and galaxy s21 please fix this
get, for, years, Purchase a game, and it doesn't get updates for 3 years?! That's completely sad. The sync with Google Cloud no longer works, so you can no longer resume a game from other devices. I lost my saved games when I had to replace/upgrade my Android. Absurd!
locked, at, 30fps, The game is great. But I'm giving it 3 stars just because it's locked at 30fps. I'm pretty sure that my phone would be able to run it at 120fps without any problems. Please update the game to support high frame rates and add some graphic settings so the game can look as good as on PC. Nowadays phones are definitely powerful enough to run this game at higher graphic settings and frame rate.

beating, on, pc, Plays like the pc verison with less graphics. Enjoyed playing it even after beating the game on the pc.
put, on, mobile, Love this game and this port is amazing on phones, wish they'd figure out how to put the sequels on mobile so I can enjoy them on here as well.
Work, for, 3/4, Work well for 3/4 of the game, then it crashes. Was expecting a better game for the price. Edit 1: Game loads when you select single player and then load the profile. Next step is to load the cloud saved game. It works!!! Form then on, all the missions are smooth. Edit 2: The final mission is unplayable!! A particular door never opens, blocking players way to next stage. Graphics: Average. Was not expecting more on a mobile port. Gameplay: Good. Controls are not as good as on console.

load, in, game, Not the best xcom experience, it takes a while to load in game and whenever you leave you load in again. Buy the new xcom 2 app once it releases on Android instead

save, on, S7, Good game, but I can't save on my Galaxy Tablet S7. Please fix this!
Keeps, on, giving, Best paid game on play. Keeps on giving, really hard but achievable.
works, with, phones, I love this game. It works perfectly with my previous phones. But since I bought a new phone a Samsung A71, the game crashes when I start it, load the saved game, and even saving the game. I hope you can fix this and make this game compatible with my new phone.
play, on, mobile, Awesome that I was able to play this on mobile
playing, on, pc, Its like playing it on pc but with bad camera controls. 10 outta 10 though
Went, from, 5, Went from 5 to 1. Regular crashes and corrupt save files

have, on, mobile, Loved this game, so happy to have it on mobile, I am a little distressed over it lacking some content but that's okay, I'd like to see xcom 2 or a spin-off or something as well.
save, in, Cloud, I can't save the game in Google Play Cloud.
wait, for, xcom, One of the most best games i played such a beautiful game cant wait for xcom 2
crashes, to, launcher, Needs updating. Can't save my games. It just crashes to the launcher. Resolution doesn't fit my display either with black bars on either side. Worked fine on earlier android versions but not with 10 it seems on LG G8 ThinQ.

have, for, it, Awesome game! I loved XCOM: Enemy Unknown and i love this one too (XCOM: Enemy Within). I will say that the constant crashes is frustrating. Sometimes I'll have to open the app 7 or more time before it'll actually let me play; but that's the only real criticism i have for it.
compared, to, ps3, Updated review. 5 years ago its realy impressive, even at today's rate its on the level. It's defiantly reduced compared to ps3 and no controler support. My old tablet and anther phone played multiplayer matches n touch is pretty good. it's a large 3.5 gig title and everything has failed downloading until like 4th try. So I found an old 7in sam tablet n I'm just trying to play multiplayer again with my son, can't download it GOOGLE. So I'll just keep trying "instal rulete" like I always did

play, in, mode, Do not play this game in Ironman mode, there are just too many bugs.
made, for, version, Flat out doesn't work, everytime I tried opening it I got a message stating the game was made for an older version of my operating system. I would really enjoy an update that allows it to work on the more recent OS versions (Google Pixel 4)

put, into, it, Love the game and details put into it... Negatives, takes time to get accustomed to the player movements, understandable though because of using a mobile device... and loading saved gameplay is terrible (7 out of 10 times connection to resume game fails),needs to be fixed.
playing, on, devices, One of the best games on mobile, but compared to playing it on older devices it definitely needs an update.
moving, to, roof, Great strategy game. It's an almost complete port of the 2013 PC game; includes all base-management and tactical-mission goodness that you could want. The three biggest issues in the game itself are: limited savegame slots (only 4? really? though not a problem if you like playing Ironman mode), semi-trivial UI issues (a few things which were easy with keyboard+mouse are not trivial with a touchscreen, like moving to a roof, and it's not hard to double-tap by mistake and cause your soldier to move) and that out of all specific missions the only one they kept was the horrible Site Recon. (Those missions are the only cut content - everything else is here, including cutscenes.) An additional problem is that the app is not updated since 2017 - either this or no-longer-present servers are probably to blame for cloud saves and multiplayer not working, and achievements/leaderboards not being viewable in the game itself (still can be viewed through Google Play Games app).

interact, with, major, Harrowing! I can't interact with major in game items. Thus cant further the story.
go, with, it, Just a dude. I wanted to say XCOM is great for mature gamers who go crazy with it. However, the tutorial crashes and the campaign feels lopsided without it...Imma try again and rebuy it on PC BECAUSE...I had beat XCOM 2 with all expansions and am well aware these guys deserve honorable faith. It is NOT a cash grab or cheesy series. It's legitimate as a video game and I am picky with what I spend time on.

connect, with, soilder, Excellent game worth every cent, HQ management, turn base combat, the customization options allow you to connect with each soilder when one dies or is promoted the game has more meaning the game pulls you in and your focused on the scenario the game puts you in. Its honestly a must play,

updating, to, android, Game crash on android 9 but after updating to android 10 i reinstalled the game and it work perfectly
expect, from, releases, A near-perfect port of the console/PC game; everything you'd expect from the higher-end releases is here in full; the combat, the base management, the many instances of KIA, it's all here! The only real compromise here is the graphics, to allow for older devices to run it. But when the gameplay is this solid, that can easily be overlooked. And since XCOM 2 will eventually come to Android, there's no excuse not to give this a go, especially at only a $5 price point.

change, after, lmao, Can't even change elevation after the tutorial lmao
get, on, Android, As good as an Xcom experience you'll get on Android. Full game so lots of content!
runs, on, phone, Best game on android. This IS the Xbox game to a T, no gacha bs or hidden fees. 5 bucks for endless fun! Somehow it actually runs better on my phone than an xbox, no crashes so far. Only drawback I see so is the limited 4 saves which ain't much of a drawback! A+++++

start, from, point, Good story n strategy game though if it was first person it had been more great but splendid game though only Little chunky is the camera though n no character customisation other than that game is great n plz add cloud save if we change device we can start from that point
progress, through, mission, The controls didn't function well.. I was unable to progress through the mission because the controls didnt respond. Please help to fix this.. I am using Huawei Nova 5t
look, around, levels, Fantastic port. Turn-based games like this is perfect for mobile. Only have minor gripes. Wish there was an option to turn off double tap to move, it was never precise enough to use reliably, especially when you start using areial units. Also, an option for scroll speed would have been amazing, rather than having to swipe a whole bunch of times to look around the larger levels. Some minor graphical glitches too. Overall, this is the best PC port I've ever played. Definite buy.
work, for, me, Overall just as good as the original, a great strategy game. Multiplayer won't work for me, kills battery fast (one mission can take over 15% easy), hots up your phone and is missing some content like cosmetics and cuteness but is still outstandingly fun, one of the best mobile games I own.
played, on, platforms, Having played previous XCOM games on other platforms I'm glad to tell players the dev team have maintained their excellent traditions. FULLY DESTRUCTIBLE SCENERY!!!! Awesome new tech, weapons, upgrades etc. Superb depth of play for the player who delights in tactics & strategy. Multiplayer. All for £2. No pay to win. The list of accolades goes on as does my gratitude. Thanks dev team for delivering the goods again.

work, on, phones, It doesn't work on the new android phones because the game is outdated
get, on, top, Yea, this bugs in the game, need to be addressed! Major glitching going on! Especially when trying to get your units up on top of buildings or vehicles (buses). Then there's other's! Last update was in 2017! We're in 2020! Get a move on already! Geeez!!!
restricted, to, slots, "Only" 4 stars because of Cloud problems, as a hardcore save-scummer being restricted to only 4 save slots is waaay too little (for safety reasons as well). That being said, game sometimes freezes during loads which leads to some save slots exclusively being used for "unstucking your progress" leads to even bigger frustration about the Cloud problem + no achievements are recorded which is annoying. Camera that resets every turn on it's starting position is abnoctious but it's still worth buying.

moving, from, ground, Very good port. The controles are good enough to play the game. Some small inconveniences are the screen scaling and elevated position scaling. Make sure you are clicking where you think you are clicking when moving from ground to elevation.

looking, to, port, wonderful port albeit it being old. Controls works beautifully and gameplay still holds up. really am looking forward to the xcom 2 port.
crashes, on, startup, Great price for a full game + DLC. Gave 4/5 cuz sometimes the game crashes on startup. XCom on the phone is exactly what I'm looking for

work, on, S7, The app should be updated to successfully work on the Samsung Tab S7. Such a great game should not go to waste. Please update.

finished, on, phone, Great game, I've finished it today (on a mobile phone - Samsung A51). The graphics are really cool, I liked both the short term and long term aspects of the game. The only problem I've noticed is related to the "save to cloud" feature, that does not work. But I had no need for that anyway. Lookin' forward to xcom2 for android.

play, in, force, connot play in pixel1 alway force stop
optimized, for, phones, Game is great but controls are bad and the game is not optimized for recent phones.
played, on, PS4, Balls deep into the game, played it on the PS4 originally. Outstanding quality, was a little dubious about buying it. Worth every penny, it's the exact same game, a little tedious occasionally with moving the squad, nothing to take away a well deserved 5 star rating. Great job converting a great game to mobile! How about a free customised decal, armour, soldiers, ect, for an honest review ;) One happy customer! I'm using Samsung Galaxy S10.

play, on, laptop, It's playable but it's much more annoying than attempting to play it on a laptop, console or pc. The distance settings are forgotten every time a turn starts forcing you to resize the screen constantly, the insides of buildings don't display unless you actually attempt to move someone into them, on other formats you can adjust the layer of the building you're looking at and there's no way to turn on a display of where it's possible to move to without first actually trying to move. It's annoying.

made, for, mobile, Fabulous port from the original. Well made for mobile. Occasional glitch with saves but that's a small price to pay, and usually resolves itself with a second attempt to load. Truly, brilliant. Xcom fan forever!!

notice, in, missions, Great strategy game. Handles well. Did notice a glitch in the first couple missions that blocked my guys from going up ladders but wasn't necessary
updated, in, years, Have the devs abandoned this game as it hasn't been updated in three years?! Biggest frustration is the alien abduction mechanic of the game.Choosing one country out of three only for panic levels to rise exponentially throughout the continents the other two are from is a major flaw as it's game over too soon when 8 dropout after reaching the critical level.It's especially grating as you're getting a handle on the game, really enjoying it.Don't have the panic levels rise so high, please.

works, on, s10e, I was worried since the devs abandoned the game years ago. I am pleased to say it works fine on a Samsung s10e with current Android OS as of 11/2020. It is a clone/port of the PC game, so there are some UI inconveniences as you would expect. But the game does not crash and there is only one game breaking bug that is easily avoidable once you find it.

Love, on, phone, Love it, even on a phone that I consider sub-par.... All things considered. Fun and great throw back I didn't know was available in the play store.
STAY, AS, I'M, Good port but having to zoom out every single time you move a new character is a pain in the butt. Completely ruins the game for me. PLEASE MAKE THE VIEW ZOOMED OUT AND STAY THAT WAY AS AN OPTION I'M BEGGING YOU 🙏

work, on, phone, The game didn't work on my phone (Galaxy S10). It regularly froze on loading screens and would crash intermittently. Roughly 1/5 attempts to play worked. I requested a refund, Google Play said to contact the developer. I then contacted 2K, they said to contact the retailer. In short - the game didn't work, and neither company will give a refund. I do not recommend you purchase this game.

playing, on, screen, Great game, great port but unfortunately doesnt have recent updates that allow me playing it on 21:9 screen. Camera movements seem clingy but other than that thumbs up to developers to bring a full fledged pc port experience to android! I wish there would be more games like this.

released, Within, that, A great port of the peerless XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within that was released for consoles in 2012-2013. It does have some graphical issues and a couple of minor issues/bugs but nothing game breaking. Well worth the price and great value for what you pay.

floating, in, air, Worth the money, they fixed most of the problems. I just wish it was a bit easier to rotate the camera. There's a bug with the carapace or skeleton armor where you select decor 2, there is an arm brace floating in the air and stretches your characters arms when moving. Other than that if you want an xcom game on the go then I recommend buying this. You can play it on the plane as an "offline" game, so it's a great time killer without a real repetativeness to it like other mobile offline games.

addicted, to, stress, Xcom is very stressful. I'm addicted to stress. It's the way that I get things done. Runs mostly fine on my device, seems to be a decent port. Only occasionally screw over an operative due to a miss click.

controls, for, zoom, Auto save is pretty much iron man mode. Save games are buggy. Camera controls for zoom in and out are confused with turn. Gameplay is torture.

When you see things like this in gameplay you wonder, why am I spending my time on this...

get, on, try, Decent game. If you are looking to kill a short amount of free time, this isn't the game for you. Load up time is over a minute and even then it tends to crash and close. If you are able to get in on the second (or third) try, the missions are time consuming. Like I said, it's a decent game, but I am not looking for a game that has so much load and play time requirements.

played, through, times, The best value for money mobile game I have purchased- although expensive it is a big game and I have played through 3 times now, so I reckon that it works out as the cheapest per hour played. It is tough, tactical and deeply satisfying when you beat it. The AI is good and challenging on normal. The controls are excellent. This is basically the full PC game on your mobile. Shame number 2 isn't being ported.

save, on, cloud, Great game, but... It has it's graphic bugs. They don't bother me that much. What bothers me is that I cannot save on cloud. I switch phones allot and I want to be able to save online and continue on my next phone. They say it cannot be done... then why put that option in the menu? Anyways... it's a game worth playing and buying!

shines, in, gameplay, Loved it! The story is bit silly but well written and people clearly put a tonne of sci-fi-ish sounding thought into it. But the game really shines in it's gameplay. You know that feeling you get when you start a new game with nothing and then end up at the ending feeling like an almighty force of God itself... This game got's that in aces of spades. Thanks developers!

played, for, years, An excellent strategy game, I've played this for years and I just keep playing it
brought, to, 👌, This is what mobile gaming should be, no extra microtransactions, no filler garbage or time limits. A solid game brought perfectly to a mobile platform 👌
seem, at, times, Love xcom and always come back to it. Must be me being rubbish but I find it hard to progress even on easy - the dice rolls seem unfair at times! But enjoyable as hell and a perfect port
Finished, on, modes, Had fun. Finished it yesterday on higher modes. Wish there was a multi select option. But ya great game, enjoyable.
waiting, for, port, Still waiting for xcom 2 port. 2025
wasted, on, game, Hate the concept can't believe I wasted money on another vault dwelling game
playing, on, GS9, Im playing on a GS9+. Why, why, why cant more developers bring actual games to mobile platforms? Far from another idle clicking, ad infested, p2w rubbish... this is a fully loaded port of one of the all time greats. It plays well on the small screen - my only gripes are some of yhe fine detail in control. Auto zooming in on characters, and not being able to turn off double-tap to move cause some problems. Its a banger.

look, like, what, Money well spent. This is what mobile gaming should look like, pay once and enjoy everything. 10 stars minimum for the game, developer, and app. Honestly I can't believe they made it this cheap, worth every penny. No internet needed, unless to save profile. Wish it got updated more, but no complaints
broken, due, updates, Amazing Game, but cloud-saves and multiplayer are broken. It looks like the game's Google Play Games integration is broken due to back-end updates and 2K has no plans to restore functionality. I was really hoping to play multiplayer, but this feature is broken. Otherwise it is a fantastic game, with everything the desktop version has (except a couple of DLC that another reviewer mentioned)
came, with, Soldier, The biggest thing you need to know is that the mobile port is missing a large chunk of customization options. The console versions came with the Elite Soldier and Slingshot DLC. Those two added a significant amount of customization options to the soldiers. So if you're buying the mobile port because you think you will have access to them, you wont. Customization options feel limited without those in the DLC. Less maps and no voiceover in different languages as well. Other than that, it's XCOM.

buy, on, cause, A soldier that goes up a floot can't come down. The game also forces the tutorial so don't bother deselecting it. I reccomend you buy a recent xcom game on another platform cause this game is NOT it..
get, to, controls, All fine. Childhood game. Need to get use to controls, but after you get used to controls game is awesome. Like old times.

shorten, at, work, Still the greatest game of all time. I'm completely addicted...please shorten the launch of the game and give the option to open quietly.i' m at work lol
installed, for, year, Doesn't launch anymore, just says "download failed" and closes everytime, I've had this app installed for at least a year.
Played, through, twice, Wow, I am impressed. Played through this twice on console and this port matches the experience. No problems on my low end phone either. I wasn't sure it would run smooth or at all. Controls are solid although it would have been nice to lock the camera zoomed out. Very pleased over all.

crash, in, days, Hope you also add the other missions of enemy within in the future also please add support to android 10 users please dont know if this will crash in days to come...aside from that keep it up👍
encountered, on, platform, Maybe the first truly well developed mobile game I've ever played that wasn't rife with micro transactions. I honestly think this is the first time I've encountered a game on a mobile platform that was just good old, straight up, "we developed a good game, and you can buy it and play it" No gimmicks. Made me reconsider what a mobile game can be, and made me want more XCOM in my life. A franchise I had previously ignored on other platforms.

clip, off, map, Fantastic game but one game-ruining bug on the final mission where an alien must clip off the map or something prevents the door after the Sectopods from opening. Really game breaking

playing, for, days, Game crashes and I been playing this game for 93 days but stuck one level 1
crashing, before, mission, Constant crashing before first mission. Haven't been able to play yet. Wasted my money on this one.

cut, on, screen, "Last updated 3 years ago." The game is falling apart. Trying to cloud save will crash it. The top is cut off on the edit soldier screen. Sometimes the whole thing freezes. Please update for current version of Android, thanks!

complaining, about, controls, PSA: For everyone complaining about the controls and such... look people the game is massive for a mobile game so its gonna heat up your phone which can make the touch screen malfunction. If the controls are starting to act up, your phone is probably too hot.. turn it off or put an ice pack on that bad boy for a few and you should be good and keep your screens clean. That's all.

switching, on, phone, Saving doesn't work. Hope you can beat a 30+ hour game without switching tabs on your phone. F
hear, After, time, Experiencing problems with sound. After some time in game sound partially not working, can only hear music, no voice or other effects. Really ruins the game for me so far. UPD: Also crashes almost every second time I launch it and resume game. And controls are awful, as was mentioned by smb else here...
save, on, cloud, Crashes when trying to save on cloud.
listened, to, reviews, Forget it, wish i would've listened to the other reviews about the glitches. The fact i paid for it makes it so much worse - is there a way to rate this a negitve start rating?

work, on, note, Old game won't work on 9 note
get, through, mission, The game is broken. The first tutorial missions are playable because every move is scripted. But I couldn't even get through the first actual mission due to a series of glitches. I restarted the app 3 times for 3 different glitches on the same mission then just gave up. So don't buy this.

remembered, in, PC, Wow! Just wow! This is XCOM for PC, so so so much fun! I haven't tried the multiplayer, but the single player is just as I remembered in PC! Please oh please port XCOM 2! For those of you too young, or having never owned a gaming PC, XCOM is a game that comes from a genre that doesn't involve bombarding you with ads and P2W gameplay or unnecessary grinding and premium content! You buy the game, you get the full game!

looking, for, what, Absolutely fantastic, just what I've been looking for. Can't tear myself away. Only real complaint: I think money should be easier to get on the 'normal' level, an agency like this would never be this chronically underfunded. Unfortunately the app crashes numerous times before I get to play but so far has never done so during play.

gotten, into, it, It's a pretty damn good port. Or from the ground up, either way, it's xcom. I haven't gotten too far into it. So I can't really attest to the bugs. Though, I haven't encountered any, thus far. *after a recent system update for my galaxy a20, the game now says, after starting up, "this app was built for an older version of android and may not work properly.." we you guys be updating this game, as well? Or are we s.o.l?

Living, to, legacy, Late to the party on this one, but this is still a great game for mobile. A little repetitive with the levels but challenging enough. Living up to the XCOM legacy.
want, on, go, I can't access Multiplayer. I have a LG V60 Thinq with dual screen. Everything else is spectacular. Having previous experience with Enemy Unknown, this app is everything I could want on the go. When I get access to multiplayer, this review will change to 5 stars.

place, in, squares, Really bad controls. Have literally restarted levels because I can't place members in certain squares because the controls are reeeeeaaaaallly bad. It's touch screen, I get it, but this is bad. Fix your controls. For the record, veteran of XCOM on the PC.
play, on, phone, Must play game on android phone... please release xcom 2 for mobile platform...

takes, to, level, I like rts games but this one takes it to a whole new level the reason its 4 instead of 5 is sometimes the game doesnt open or the touch screen registers on a different tile to what i press other than that its a solid game the campaign is amazing i played the enemy unknown on xbox one and loved it once i seen this i paid the fee and havent stopped playing it for the last month

hits, on, note, Good game to snag on sale! Kinda buggy, weird camera sometimes and random crashes but I love xcom and it hits on that note.
gets, to, version, The game is buggy but playable. Try to skip the tutorial if you can as that part is often unplayable. Oncr you get past that it gets better and closer to the PC version.
leads, into, mission, A little laggy crashes a few times but it's good. My main complaint is that it's lacking some of the best content, like the mission where you rescue a psionic woman that I think leads into the base assault mission, in this version the base assault is far too early.

played, on, pc, Never played XCOM 1 on the pc, so I cant rlly compare this to that. However, I have played XCOM 2. If you want to have a XCOM experiance on the go, this is the game. There is also no microtransaction. You pay for the game you get the whole game. I haven't run into any bugs yet but by seeing the other reviews I'm sure I would encounter some. All in all, if you want a quality game on mobile and not those cash grab ad "games" you see in the top free section in the playstore, this is the game.

played, on, 2017, played this version first on 2017, and sadly no changes or updates since then. checked the cpu clock always stay at max 2.84ghz which is worrying. battery drained fast. have some buggy game crash early on. does not support other aspect ratios than 16:9. texture muddy and no details. dont look good at all for the file size. lots of missing feature from pc version. controls are decent. it's okayish for what it worth on sale. but hey, it's xcom on mobile! please continue to port your games firaxis

function, on, galaxy, Though the game looks great, it doesn't function well on galaxy note 10+. Constant lock ups and freezing. The game becomes unplayable at points.
get, past, controls, Wish it included more content, or the option for it. Some of the crashing issues have been fixed. It definitely is much more bearable as far as controls since the original port. All in all it's a good introduction, but bare bones version for android. Still xcom, still enjoyable.if you cant get past the controls, shame on you.
save, to, cloud, I'm sorry I love this game and all but I cant save my game no matter what I cant save it to the cloud because it just crashes and It sucks please please I really want to give you a 5 star
wanted, As, fan, As a Xcom fan I really wanted to like this, but this port simply is flawed. It doesnt run smoothly even on newer devices. The controls and vision display are terribly wonky and I felt like I was fighting the controls on each turn just to be absolutely sure that the game doesnt misinterpret a double tap and get my characters killed. Overall, this doesn't feel like a completed product..

show, on, screen, An excellent port of an excellent game. The camera controls can be a bit difficult at times but its manageable. The enemy movement and Meld indicators sometimes don't show up on the screen even though you can hear the audio for it. Few bugs here and there where the game crashes if you minimize it and sometimes crashes when you try to load a save. Nothing game breaking.
Played, on, pc, Played this on pc. Loved the gameplay so wanted to try it out on android. Not playable on galaxy tablet. Having multiple issues with camera and control. Started off fine but becomes unresponsive few minutes into the first mission. Hopefully they can fix these issues/ bugs.

played, on, One, I guess you guys never played this on the Xbox One but XCOM is not a normal game its made to make you frustrated. I believe the term is GET GUD SCRUBS😎
replaying, for, year, My all time favorite. No issues, replaying it for a year now. Always a great and different experience...no other android game comes close to the depth, strategy and content this game provides.
Play, in, phone, Love this game ! They made it just like the PC version ! I don't had any issues with crashes or something alike . Play smooth in my phone
go, by, arrows, Disaster regarding Android controls. Maybe good on a PC, but the options menu here has maybe 5 pointless parameters to adjust. Turning the camera turns the wrong way if you go by the arrows. Also, every menu during battle, every character turn ends, that darn camera zooms and resets. I zoom out, it goes right back when turn is over. Seeing the entire battle is CRUCIAL, I don't need a zoomed in view of their shoes! Unplayable. Frustrating. Otherwise I liked it, except for that awful controls.

deviate, from, instructions, Excellent game, couple of small bugs on my OnePlus 6T: (1) if playing the tutorial, if you deviate from instructions you get stuck in a room with no close button and (2) the FINAL mission in the 3rd room, enemies won't spawn meaning I'm stuck in there waiting, restarting level won't fix this for me! Big shame as it's been perfectly functioning until last hurdle.

has, on, levels, Likely the best mobile port ever. Some customisation options have been lost, there's a drop in graphic quality (duh), a couple of mission types are excluded, and the camera has a bit of a do on some levels. And... that's it. One of the best games ever made is available on mobile, and it works. I've finished multiple campaigns across 100s of hours. The only qualification is that you need to be happy sitting down and plugged in - this ain't for your commute. I really hope Xcom 2 will follow.

paid, for, game, Facebook never connects. It says my xcom account cant create a multiplayer game. The multiplayer never connects! I paid for this terrible game not-optimized made by one of the biggest gaming companies in the world. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
Going, into, screen, I should have read the reviews. Everything starts up fine, but once you are in a mission you can't see anything other than a command bar. Going into the options screen is broken too as only half of the graphics in the menus are visible. The last update for this game was in 2017. It's 2020 now, so all leaving this review is going to do his hopefully prevent others from wasting their money.

have, on, go, Love this game. Ports over nicely without compromising much at all. Great to have on the go. Can't wait til xcom 2 ports...hopefully...
concentrate, on, strategy, It was very great and helps me concentrate on strategy and skill
play, on, mobile, I was excited to play this on mobile, but on the second mission I found that once my soldiers go up a level, they're stuck there forever. Moving the camera up and down doesn't help.

improving, on, mobile, Awesome game, nice story line, the graphics are awesome for I know moddling is not easy but 2k you never disappoint, the controller function van use a bit improving on mobile it's not always selecting, I will like it if you improve the character modeling function to be more like the PC, otherwise awesome game good work 2k
challenging, on, difficulty, The best strategy game on Android. Runs perfect on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e with Snapdragon 670 and 6 GB RAM, no framerate issues. Music sounds a bit low, though. Enemies are generally smart, and missions are challenging (even on Normal difficulty) but fair. I never felt like any loss of my squad members was anything but my own fault. Speaking of losing squad members, there is permadeath in this game, but it feels appropriate. I recommend this to anyone who wants to play a true strategy game.

heard, from, them, The app won't work. After installing it I open it, it starts some sort of download, it gives me a "failed download" notification and that's it. I contacted customer service and I heard nothing from them. I hope I can review this and give 5 stars in the future.

take, with, me, A absolutely love this game on Console, and PC. Even better now... I can take it with me.
updated, for, PC, Awesome update of the classic X-Com series updated for the PC and flawlessly ported to mobile. I've had no issues in the five years I've owned it, and I still play at least once a month. Worth it.

connected, to, cloud, Great game, almost as good as on PC but limited by mobile interface. 2 stars because it keeps giving me messages about not being connected to google cloud. I don't want any cloud junk! Just give me the game!
seen, on, store, Xcom is the shizzle my nizzles, easily the best game I have seen on play store . When I rail my girl, I get her to call me commander .
give, on, update, Awsome port just update please!!why give up on this game update update update update!!!
feels, like, problem, Graphics are great, game itself is on par with the Xbox360 version. However, cloud saving crashes (feels like a permission problem) and multiplayer is not functioning. Seems like an abandoned game.

love, to, death, I love the game to death and all, but Im having this one issue where EVERY time the Sectopod uses a weapon, the app totally closes out. It was my first time seeing a sectopod, so I'm just really confused as to why this is happening
works, on, devices, Great game for other platforms... definitely works poorly on mobile devices. Extremely difficult to use control interface for things like climbing to different floors of buildings. Eventually makes some missions effectively unplayable, which in turn makes the game nigh impossible to win.

work, with, versions, Does not work with newer versions of Android or Fire Tablets, so can no longer play this game.
stuck, on, container, Umable to change elevation :/ (i use two fingers to move but it doesn't so my dude on the 1st official mission is stuck on the container and i don't see any andriod posts for tips
work, on, versions, Doesn't work on new versions of android
verging, on, abandonware, I like the game, but it is verging on abandonware. Cloud saves are broken, multiplayer is broken ("this feature isn't available for your account"). Please update this game to full functionality. It deserves better maintenance.

play, on, setting, For the price of the game its really good but frustrating to play. Sometimes you play a level and your on normal setting but its like your on hard setting. The big problem for me is the save and load game it doesnt work and that is really annoying, iv had to restart the game 5 times now and lose everything you worked for. Now iv got to start from the begining yet again. Only 2 stars just cos of the save and load game problem i would gladlie give it a solid 4 star if that gets fixed, please fix.

read, before, purchasing, Should've read reviews before purchasing... Found it doesn't work properly on later versions of Android (I'm on 10) and crashes when starting a game. Managed to get it working on my old tablet but it's very slow (lollipop). Google play should be updated so it won't install on later devices, or fix the problem...

adapted, for, phones, Amazing that the pc game was completely adapted for phones. Runs smoothly and has good graphics for a mobile game. It is unfortunate that not all the dlc are included
save, on, Clouds, I like the Game alot but i have some bug issue with the game. I can't resume the game on main menu (The Game quit spontaneously); also can't save the game on Clouds. Btw it also mentioned 'XCOM:EW This app was built for an older version of Android and may not work properly. Try checking for updates, or contact the developer." Any advice? Thank You 🙏

finish, on, android, I have never been able to finish this game on android even once, at some point it always crashes, I have reinstalled it, and restarted the campaign about 3-4 times, Honestly it's fun, well xcom, but don't spend money on this since we'll it is broken

running, with, men, Seriously, the difficulty even on normal is insane. There's a difference between making things difficult, and making them frustrating. Serious...I'm fighting about 15 exalt agent's..then they get reinforced two turns running with an extra 7 men...and your telling me that's normal? If I wanted a challenge like that then I would play on hard difficulty...I just wanted to play through the story. Guess I want coz they always seem to ramp up the difficulty so you can't get nowhere.

put, in, OverWatch, So the first mission after the tutorialI'm no longer able to move one of my soldiers or attack or put him in OverWatch or do anything I literally cannot continue. If it was a free-to-play game or cheaper than it is it wouldn't be a big deal.
make, for, android, Thank you for updating this app. By doing this I have awarded it 5 stars instead of 1. I have played it and I have to say that 2k games have made another "class" game. Could you make xcom 2 for android
used, in, Android, Needs update to be used in Android 10, keeps crashing
played, through, 1, I love XCOM! I've played through 1 & 2 and I'm looking forward to chimera squad. I thought I would purchase this game to occupy my time but the game was unplayed during the second mission. The function of raising the elevation of the camera or curser requires you to use two fingers to swipe up or down. After dozens and dozens of times, I was only able to accomplish this action 1 time and I know this would be a reoccurring issues I couldn't live with.

work, with, galaxy, App was great needs update though, won't work with galaxy note 10 plus. Gets just about to the end of the second mission and my heavy keeps locking up my game.

restart, in, hours, Bugs out and crashes constantly. Four times game breaking bugs have made me have to restart an entire level in as many hours.
want, in, store, It's good but damn i really want more game like this in play store !
compared, to, rest, Great game. Lots of elements; however, the final battle is very easy compared to the rest of the game.
watch, down, end, Ruined by no restart mission option. I love these games but miss a save or have it not load (and it OFTEN wont) you can easily watch days of play head down a dead end. Cloud save will randomly load old games. I have one now from years ago, my current no win possible save and a save from a few days ago. AI decide which level they want to be. Right now they never miss. My guys are missing barns. My last playthrough was not like this. Movement needs a take back option for touchscreens.
think, of, movement, Great game, fun and the thing about turn base game like this is we can relax and think of our next movement. Hope u can make XCOM 2 available on android :)

updated, to, system, It was good when it worked. Since my phone updated to a newer operating system, the game will no longer run. It attempts to download a patch but there is not patch available. I'd like my account refunded.
loved, since, version, I loved this game since the PS4 version. Was surprised you could do things the PS4 couldn't but ever since I was able to download this it has officially " bugged " up during an operation/Missions it won't let me do?

fixed, after, review, Great game but constant crashes on S8+ keep forcing me to rewatch the 1 minute intro video... Was fixed a couple months after this review, much better now.
get, in, game, Wish it was alil easier to complete missions to get further in the game
Payed, for, game, Payed only 5.49$ for this magnificent game — on Xbox Live it was 19.99$. Best turn based strategy game @ Google Play. Played through the game multiple times and never needed to make in game purchases. And I'm very happy to see no graphical difference between my Xbox 360 and my Smartphone (Umidigi A5 Pro Phone). Only disadvantage is that it has less maps than the Xbox version. Big thanks to the developers

dissapointing, for, me, Good game, just that im heavy gamepad gamer on android and it just support left joystick only, and that quite dissapointing for me
Ran, on, LG, Amazing game. Comparable to the 360 Xbox version. Ran well on my generic LG that I purchased this year. Four stars instead of five because they used up all of my available space on my phone and my phone doesn't allow me to utilize SD card for saving apps

ported, over, game, It's a wholly ported over game. Works fantastic. Great at what it is supposed to do. On my phone and offline too. Just the perfect game for xcom fans until xcom 2 on the the phone comes out. Hopefully. Lol
work, on, devices, Doesn't work on newer android devices and versions
Played, on, S10, Yes! Not good for your battery, but still awesome! Played on a Samsung Galaxy S10+ No real issues other than some Camera/hight selection ines. Just save regulairly.
Lowered, to, stars, Lowered to 3 stars since the online mode doesn't work anymore
played, through, titles, An incredible Xcom experience on your phone! Have played through both PC titles and am so impressed with how well this translates. Sure, movement can be a little tricky with these fat fingers, but it's compelling and ultra addictive. Go shoot some aliens in the face.

add, to, game, I like the game but it will be nice if you add some long war to this game
ported, to, Android, This appears to be the full PC version, ported to Android. Needs a lot of horsepower, though. Runs great on my Galaxy Note 9, but not so well on an older device.
making, through, portion, Great game, just recently started crashing after making it through a good portion of the game. 😕
playing, through, mission, Poorly optimized port. Laggy animation, insane load times. Didn't bother playing through first mission due to the framerate issues. LOVE XCOM though !

play, on, ps4, Love it. Made me play xcom 2 on ps4. Would really enjoy if you added more maps or like a random skirmish mode, but with a seperate thing that lets you unlock troops/level up/ customize like a rpgish vibe, but my main input would be to add more characters and make it more customizable like adding more stuff for troops or make it more detailed like intsad of just armor you can change the hat torso and legs. Just more in depth i would even pay if it was addons. Sorry for the grammar.

see, because, resolution, I have a OnePlus7 Pro, and because of the resolution the phone puts me in when I play it, I cannot see some of the screen when I go to manage my soldiers. Plz fix this asap!
bought, from, phone, Games awesome on the campaign I really love it I bought it twice one from my phone and one for my girl there's a small problem with the multiplayerI like how if we're interrupted in the game we can still go back and finish it without having to redo everythingto set it up but sometimes you won't be able to move your characters my girl had it to where she couldn't move two of her teammates it'll just skip her turns if you keep please fix this bug I really do appreciate it I love this game thank u

updated, in, time, XCOM is awesome. Sadly this port has not been updated in a long time so the app crashes randomly. This is usually a few missions in so it gives you a false hope that you will be fine. For me it crashes at the beginning of a mission on the second month. Really got my hopes up, I started two games to make sure it can be reproduced. Both times it was a different map so that's not even a specific one. I will update my review if this is fixed.

updated, in, years, Why haven't you updated your game in 3 years?
playing, on, phone, I tried playing this on my phone and it was buggy as hell and unplayable. 1*. Then I played it on a tablet and it worked fine. The game is great. So much fun to play and kept me guessing. 5*

ported, to, devices, The game itself is what's on the box, this is xcom ported pretty damn well to mobile devices, could use an update so it keeps it working for newer devices however other than a lack of updates this is just what I wanted and what I'm happy I paid for. 8/10 solid port

bear, in, mind, It runs well and is a lot of fun, but bear in mind this port hasn't been updated in basically three years. It will give you a warning on startup that it was made for an older version of Android, and it will refuse to connect to Google play or allow cloud saves. Local saves still work, though. If it were updated to allow continued use of Google play services I would give it five stars, but without that three is all it gets.

connect, to, play, Was great but newest update wont let me connect to google play to save. Able to save over previous files (overwrite existing saves) but no new ones. Love xcom, will update to 5 stars once it works again

Reinstalled, on, tablet, Reinstalled on tablet, working well now apart from Google Play error when saving
Update, to, version, Update the game to the latest version of Android. It's been three years since the last update.
have, on, games, Some issues with Google at services I don't have on other games. Otherwise still a great game
lags, at, time, Fantastic although I have a LG K20 and the game lags at most time and the battery gets hot fast I bought it from Google Play store tobad I can't get a refund for it so I uninstalled the game many some time I get a gaming phone Cheers Xmatt

play, with, touchscreen, A bit clunky to play with a touchscreen, but if you have a tablet, or a relatively large phone, then it should be fine. Otherwise a great port of XCOM.
liked, on, PC, EDIT: Year later, new tablet with 4Gb RAM running smooth. Uses between 500Mb-1Gb memory, so 1Gb of FREE RAM is a hard minimum requirement. Doesn't have Slingshot or Progeny questlines, which I really liked on PC. Misses the option to turn off the Enemy Within expansion content like you can on PC. My problem with the DLC is mostly because how rubbish and easy the whole EXALT "questline" is after aliens. Still, a great game, and a very good port, considering it's a real PC game originally.

connect, since, update, Was a very awesome port! However, since newest android update, game will no longer connect to google play, so you can no longer save the game. I have been playing this game since release. I have had it on every phone since my Note 2. But it is currently incompatible with the Note 10. I hope they find an update to fix the problem.

got, after, couple, The game is hard at first but after couple of failed attempts I finally got the hang of it thanks for a good game but if it had something more it would be awesome way more 😁😁😁.
bugs, after, turns, Broken! As said before, the game bugs out after 2/3 turns in the second level. I know XCOM is a good game, this should not have this name if its unplayable. Just saying.
work, on, Galaxy, Wont work on Galaxy 10+
save, on, phone, Can't manually save on the phone or even cloud save. Says fail to write when I do manual save and when I pick cloud save it just kicks me back out to my homescreen. I am using a Galaxy S10+, so I don't know why this game would not work, please fix this if you can.

plugged, to, mains, Awesome game ported ok controls can be frustrating at first but wants you get used to it plays brilliantly.Need to be plugged in to mains or battery pack as it drains big time. I long for more games like this on my mobile.

Put, into, this, Put hundreds of hours into this, a mobile port for this turns out to work really well. customization for all of your soldiers, from what weapon they use to what color their armor is you make the decisions in this game. The only issue I've had is sometimes it's hard to control whether you want a troop on high ground or low ground. Ik there's a button that controls elevation but even at the right elevation sometimes I tap through the ceiling of a building and my sniper dashes through and dies. 🤷

occur, on, devices, Could you fix the crashes that occur on Samsung Galaxy A8 2018 devices? Other wise the game is amazing, a great port. Port XCOM 2 maybe wink wink?
missing, from, game, Its xcom can never go wrong runs well. But I have noticed a lot of the cut scenes are missing from the game not a big deal guess they gotta save space somewhere. The big deal is the games touch controls. They are abysmal beyond belief. Like wow this game has a hard time with them and it gets worse on multilevel and elevation maps. If you can stand the infuriating touch control I would say get it.

finished, in, day, Dear Devs please add some more new contents and also some new weapons I finished the game in 1 and a half day in my first try so come on gave us some new content new missions we paid for it I thought I was paying for the best Android game but it turned out to be just good so please update the game and gave us some new things, thank you.

climb, on, roof, It's a great port. But I can't play it. Whenever I play a mission and kill every alien the mission doesn't end. And I can't climb on roof

use, in, mission, It's still XCOM but very slow and cumbersome. Everything about the touch controls is hard to use in mission. Selecting the abilities is about the only thing that I don't regularly have trouble with. But at the end of the day it's still turn based so as long as you're careful and learn the tricks the cumbersome controls don't ultimately matter and the game that is here is a modern classic. The pros of being able to play such an amazing game on my phone vastly outweighs the cons

do, in, sitting, Great game but just wont save. Tried manual and it says corrupt. Tried auto and doesn't work. Unless I want to do the entire campaign in one sitting, I've just wasted my money. Ridiculous.
adapting, to, mobile, Amazing work adapting this gem to mobile!
Works, with, android, Works with android 10. Watch out with the resume button (autosave) as it often doesn't work and you lose your game if you don't have a manual save. Even though you can save manually at any time this is ridiculous for a paid product. When I didn't play for a year my game wouldn't run but after reinstalling it the game and saves were fine. Too bad there are some bugs like this but the game is still great and it's actually a real game unlike most shallow stuff that is on phones and tablets.

works, on, 3xl, THAT'S XCOM BABY! I can't complain. It's an old Port that doesn't seem to be supported anymore, but it still works on my Pixel 3xl with Android 10. It crashes when I try to save to cloud, but local saves still work. It's a legit, full Port, not a dumbed down version. It lends itself well to touch screens. I just wish there were more turn based tactics games of this quality on mobile. Maybe Port XCOM 2? Something!

plays, with, something, The game in itself is fantastic, but could you PLEASE either make the loading time shorter or give us the option of replacing the intro cutscene that plays every time with something that would make the game load faster?
work, with, Android, Please update this game to work with Android 10. It is such an awesome game and if it were to stop working for any reason on my phone, it would be a huge loss. I love this game.

had, on, 360, This game is absolutly killer. I had it on my 360, but now I can take it anywhere on my phone. Kudos to the developers on all xcom games, this one especialy. Such a great stratagy game. WELL worth the money hand down completely.

purchased, in, iphone, I have purchased this app b4 in the iphone. Loved it. Just bought it for android but wont download. Keep saying I need to delete apps to make room . Despite already having the room and deleting more apps it still wont download. I really love this game and hope this can be resolved and I can give this a proper 5 star review. Thank you

hitting, with, shotgun, First of all, at point blank range, 86% chance of hitting the target- with a shotgun, and the experienced soldier misses???? These people cant shoot ANYTHING! Ive been an xcom player for 20 years and love this game and concept - BUT- Man, ... These "soldiers" should be expected to do 'a little bit better' at least. Love the game, graphix, concept and all- but these people couldnt hit the broad side of a barn if you gave them an atomic bomb for gee wizz sake! Holy sheesh.....

playing, on, xbox, Love it. I always loved playing this game on my xbox 360. Just wish there were cheats for it, besides renaming the characters, because I am horrible at playing.
download, onto, tablet, Amazing game but it wont download onto my tablet it keeps saying download failed and id like for it to work and then ill change it to a 5

do, about, it, Google Pixel 3XL - runs well, smooth frame rate. The controls are jacked but idk what they could really do about it since it's touch.
played, on, mobile, Best game i' ve played on mobile. Fun and difficult. I played X-com: Enemy Unknown, and this is almost just like that, other than, the new mods with troops, and the EXALT forces.
invite, in, tale, $$$$/$$$$ One of the newest greatest additions to my google play library. A completetrly animated and action packed board game with a great plot, lots of customizations, and light but great looking graphics that invite the player inmerse in an amazing science fiction tale Sci-fi Stargate style. A one of a kind experience for strategist and rpg lovers, you will get the full commander in chief simulation experience with affecting desicion making RPG games style. Definitelly A MUST!!!! $$$$/$$$$
translates, to, devices, XCOM: Enemy Within for mobile is a diamond in the rough. It's a full port of XCOM Enemy Unknown with the Enemy Within DLC and translates well to mobile devices. The camera controls are a bit wonky at times, but it's easier to figure out over time. This game works flawlessly on my Motorola Z3 and it's a great game to pass the time.

account, for, iteration, This is a prime example of how to port a game correctly. All the elements of the original are there. The UI is functional. Yes, you need suitable hardware to run it, and a dev can't account for every iteration of Android. But if it really isn't working on your device, that's why the refund button is there. Pick it up for cheap on PC or Console.

play, on, settings, One of the best games on my phone. Once you learn the controls for camera views and height movement it becomes very intuitive. I will not play it on Iron Man settings as your shots tend to miss more often than their % indicates. I chalk this up to trying to make the game more challenging for masochistic players who need that extra frustration. A great game.
coming, to, app, Great game, I'm a big X-com game fan is X-com 2 coming to mobile app as well. If so will it be for Moto Z4
work, with, version, Sigh... Doesn't work with the latest version of Android, and it seems like the developer had stopped supporting it. Terrible experience for a paid game!
get, into, position, Great game only let down is the camera can be difficult to get into a decent position but to be fair playing on a smaller screen it was always going to be difficult.
Get, on, reboot, Great update to my second favorite 1990 Microprose game. Wish the volume for the video clips was also mutable, but for a 2$ sale price it's the best playstore purchase I've made. Get on the reboot of Master of Magic!!!!!
looking, at, level, My only problem is occasionally it's hard to adjust what height level you're looking at. Otherwise a great mobile version of a great game. Well worth the price.
save, in, clouds, The game's great with all the features but why it's always crashed when I try to save the game in clouds? Is it just me or is there anybody got the same problem?
Tried, on, devices, Poorly optimised. Tried this several times on different devices and it's rarely been a good experience. Shame since Xcom on mobile/tablet makes alot of sense.
get, past, mission, Clunky broken. Can't even get past second mission. Save your money.
works, on, note, so now nolonger works on my note 3 and never could instal on google nexus 9. last upddate killed it and all my saves :/

work, on, Android, Doesn't work on OnePlus 7 Pro Android 10, it keeps loading forever.
stop, on, turn, The game is bugged. Just bought it and it will stop on your turn. not ket you choose any options.
paid, for, this, I paid for this but can't install it not happy it stops when I download half of it wants money back or fix it super annoying coz I had this game on pc really Wanted it to work

work, with, versions, Wont install, tried 3 times. It wastes my time & money downloading & refuses to install. Im surprized one of the best games on mobile doesnt ever get updated to work with current android versions, it would only take a few hours to do.
install, without, issue, Bought game, 44% it says i have insufficient storage. The game is 3.3 gb but i have 4.5gb abailable space. Other apps install without issue already tested with other random apps to make sure my phone was not issue. Tried using both data and wifi. Will change rating when i can get what i payed for.

cloud, in, android, Really good overall. Except for it eat battery like no one busineas. And can't cloud save in android 10.
Tried, for, hours, Tried for hours to download and it would always crash.Still have not got refund
get, past, percentage, Really good strategic topdown squad management game. I was impressed with the depth this game has, the story is amazing, but I cannot get past the ridiculous aiming percentage and expensive upgrades, 20 days to build a satellite, really?Overall, the game is very good, hence the 4 stars.
hangs, on, mission, This game game hangs dead on 2nd mission! This bug even migrated from consoles and PC. I work in IT myself and I say WHOEVER DECIDED TO IGNORE IT SHOULD DIE HORRIBLY

play, on, mobile, It's difficult to select the right tile, select the right soldier, it's just difficult to play on mobile.
played, on, PC, I played this game on PC and this port is exactly the same. The control of the game is a bit hard but that is something I expected. There's a bug though - I can't connect to Google play and thus I have no access to cloud storage. Let's hope the devs will fix this problem.

playing, for, days, I've been playing for 2 days and in my experience. This game is amazing packed with missions decision making and stretgic gameplay. The fight scenes are great and the cut scenes are among the best if not the best ive seen in a mobile game. I strong approve of this game.

optimized, for, devices, Fantastic game for PC. Works pretty well on mobile devices too. However even using the latest hardware (Galaxy S10) it cranks up the temperature of the phone really fast (mine reached around 40°C), which makes me think this is more suited to tablets (larger thermal dissipation area) if you want to keep your battery intact for more than a year. I don't know that the game could be more optimized for mobile devices, so I'll just give it five stars. But, beware!
add, to, game, Excellent game.a few issues, but gonna try not to rehash other comments. You have to make a mobile version of the second xcom or just add a bunch of "consumer friendly" dlc(maps, characters, etc) to this game. I'd buy all of it lmao. I wish the ranger class was in this game.
locks, on, S10plus, Crashes and locks up on my S10plus Id like a refund

looking, for, that, This is the game that I was looking for. Guns, action, and a lot more. The only thing that I putted three stars for this is when the enemy gets so strong. And when you lost the game. You will start all over again its just so boring doing all you just did. I'm sorry for putting three stars

Love, on, PC, Love the game on PC. Downloads. Shows repeated errors when opening. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and tried tinkering with permissions. Still doesnt work. Can't recommend a game that doesn't work. Can't get refund.

carry, to, extraction, Game is incomplete, you're supposed to have the ability to revive/stabilize troops that are downed. Once you stabilize them you are supposed to be able to carry them to extraction. You can stabilize them, but you cant carry them, and even if you eliminate all hostiles in the AO you should get them back since you stabilized them, they're counted as KIA no matter what you do with them and you lose them. Also, autosave is set when one of your troops is killed or at the start of the next round.

Follow up: The developers refuse to offer refunds, even though their game is broken. If you have been told this by their support team, contact the Google Play support and let them know.
played, on, phone, My all time favorite strategy game. The fact that it can be played on my phone makes me thrilled. Worth every dollar you spend.
install, on, S8, Won't install on Samsung S8. Installation will start, then crash by about 50%. While it's attempting to install, the app slows down the rest of the phone system significantly.

ported, to, phones, A massive PC\console game ported to phones that not only looks fantastic but plays exceptionally and proves that console level games without BS micro transactions that are filled tk the brim with content are possible on mobile devices. This game is the definition of premium.

go, from, part, The game is great but there is one major problem the scroll speed for the maps is severely under sensitive if I want to go from one part of the map to another it can take about 10 swipes which is kind of ridiculous. Is there a mod or a setting that I have missed to fix this problem that makes it nearly unplayable

feel, on, game, This was the first game I was giving 5 stars. I never played xcom before and it keep me hooked for several days still I was playing and it's same as pc nothing changed and it's awesome. The only thing I feel bad on this game is when any of my solider dies...
come, with, more, One of the best games. A one of a kind experience. I hope they come out with more.
run, on, HD8, It won't run on my Fire HD8... Just tells me 'download failed'. Got it running on my phone, but the screen is just too small for it.

install, to, g5, Could not install to my moto g5 or my android 8.1 MT-107. Loving the pc version is the only reason i am rating this attempted purchase. I would need to see how the controls are with a cell phone and/or tablet then i could rate this game higher.
fits, on, screen, Amazing port, just a minor niggle. Not all of the image fits on my screen and there is no scale options.
play, on, Note, Great and addictive game. I play it on my Galaxy Note 8 worh no problem at all. This game dont get onl for me.
have, on, xbox, I have this on my xbox as well. Great game but now it crashes at the start up (galaxy s9)

coincides, with, truth, Amazing strategy that uniquely coincides with the conspiratorial truth of the last 100 years.
put, on, PC, The game itself is great and I love it (have put in hundreds of hours on PC) and it looks amazing on my Razer Phone 2!
