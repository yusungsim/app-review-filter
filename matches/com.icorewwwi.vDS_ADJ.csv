remenicent, cheat, Really enjoyed it. I was able to play games I haven't played since I was a kid. The emulator also has a cheat menu remenicent of an action replay my friend had. Definatly worth the dollar price.

emulator, best, While is it unfortunate that you have to pay for it, it is the best DS emulator for android money can buy. Heavily customizable in every setting possible and runs at a very consistent framerate. If I could rate 4.9 stars I would because me likey dark mode and there's no dark mode feature.

design, different, Literally just drastic but with a different menu design even the files are named the same when ya download it great as a cheap alternative although if you are gonna steal someone else's creation at least try hard to hide it.

tactics, final, I was playing "final fantasy tactics adv 2" and the game would crash in certain areas and when loading in multiple hit spells. It is a bit clunky but overall quite cheap. I switched to a $5.00 paid version with identical user interface but 5-star for smoothness and 5-star for rendering spells happier with my new experience but definitely used this alot until I found it. Don't settle, there are better emulators out there!

emulator, only, I don't usually rate apps anymore but this is legitimately the only good DS emulator on the app store. If you want something that runs good to fill you with Nostalgia this is the emulator you want. Might seem glitchy at times but you just have to go to the settings to fix it and if you're confused they have a help button! (:

emulator, Great, Great emulator, brings me so much nostalgia playing games I used to play years ago and I love finally playing those I never got to play back then! :) I really love how you can save screen layouts for every game individually. To the people having problems with the app after it working just fine and then trying to boot up a game again: For me it works going to App info > Storage > Clear Cache (don't worry, it won't affect any of your save data). Maybe it helps someone here.

controller, wired, This is the one. I tried using others and others with ads and they failed me. My wired controller works great for the vDS emulator. Worth the 99c.

emulator, great, It's a great emulator I love it. Though speeding up makes it a little weird and sometimes there are glitches.
skin, different, Literally just drastic with a different skin... 1 star no sd loading
emulators, last, Runs better than expected. I was expectant to want a refund as the last 3 emulators proved useless to me and would not run my roms. However, not only does Mario run well, I have actually been able to relive my nintendogs nostalgia thanks to this app. Five stars.
DSi, handheld, Since my handheld DSi started crashing I downloaded this & I'm absolutely loving it 💝
crashes, minimal, Its so close to ds with minimal crashes.
emulator, working, Finally a working emulator. Works great and has no Lag.
price, cheaper, Why this app is so similar to Drastic? But thanks for cheaper price. Hopefully they don't shutting down this apps.
ones, free, I tried all the free ones and thought about buying the one more expansive emulator, but decided to first try this one and I gotta say it works great and has great features.

performance, good, This emulator is very good. It has good performance, and well made controls. My only problem is that the settings menu is a bit confusing to new people

games, new, As someone that is pretty skeptical about trying new games (especially ones that I have to pay for), I wasn't sure about which app to use for an emulator. I finally decided on this one after doing some research and am pleasantly surprised by the good quality and ease of use. I would recommend adjusting the on screen controls a bit to fit your comfort. But I have no complaints. 10/10

emulators, best, For being only 99 cents, this is one of the best emulators I've seen ever.
time, same, It works ok. ABXY keys are too close and often act at the same time. This also doesn't support gba rooms only DS
list, cheat, Vds is brilliant no slow down or issues with reading roms and has a cheat list for that game if you into using cheats 4 stars I would give it 5 the only think that miss is local wireless features if u able to make those features in the game workable it be no no question 5 stars (if it plan and possibly to imply)

purchase, Best, Best purchase Ive made. For $1.69, Ive had no issues. Everyother emulator Ive used has been bad compared to this. Recommended
games, classic, I love this app. I love classic games.
RIPOFF, DIRECT, Its a DIRECT RIPOFF of Drastic, and just like drastic it doesn't run on android 11 systems so yet another waste of cash at this point im just going to buy the cartridge and play it on my DS rather than a EMU

😎, good, Works good, no crashes😎
app, Great, Great app! I just hope you add a feature which in where we can disable the autorotate of controls! Sadly even when my autorotate on my phone is disabled, this still persist.
slots, multiple, FOR THOSE "P O K E M O N" FAN Listen! POKEMON WHITE, BLACK, WHITE 2 and BLACK works!!! It has fast forward, multiple save slots!, and redo. This is what I need! There is a ONE PROBLEM I couldn't upload the savefile to the Google Drive could pls fix it?
reskin, literal, Doesn't work on Android 10, a literal reskin of drastic; only installed this since drastic crashes while searching for games. This does the same exact thing.

emulator, good, There's No multiplayer, and I was HOPING for multiplayer so i could play with my phone and my DSi on Kirby Super Star Ultra. I REALLY dislike that that the developers haven't added multiplayer (and they probably won't, either based on how they said it.) if you like playing DS games without friends or multiplayer this is a good emulator. It doesn't lag much or crash much on newer Android devices. Thank you for reading! ❤️😊

clone, Drastic, Litterly just Drastic DS clone, so if it runs well, I'm not sure, thanks to some issues, can't even play the games I have on my External SD card anymore, until this is fixed, 1 star, an emulator that can't play games from external is just a fancy icon to me, not even using internal storage for this... And other emulators use external so I know my SD card works

user, Recent, Recent user of this app and man do I love it. Plays all my NDS games very well, especially Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and Mario Kart DS. I'd definitely recommend it to others.
people, other, Screw these other people when they say it is a drastic remake. Desume the makers of the Ds pc emulator were absolutely ripped off by the maker of drastic. They were going to seek legal action against this dude since they said no making money off of it. I would think because it is a nintendo creation They couldn't. I would say it's fair game. Who ever made this did a good job. Feels good.

It is the one what we need and what we really stick into that is the local wifi function which is needed to be added in your app like it works in My boy emulator.

features, cool, I was relatively happy with the app, and it has a lot of cool features. Unfortunately it's had reoccurring issues with save states. Recently, all the save states managed to get deleted - even the Google drive ones. Only savestates were affected, not layout options or settings, but it's a pretty major problem.

Whats the point of giving your money to a lazy scam artist instead of the real developers. At that point you can just get it for free and that's already better for everyone.

folder, same, This was literally Drastic DS emulator underneath. I have drastic installed in my phone and when I opened this, the saves actually loaded from the same folder. Refunded immediately after purchase.
emulators, other, Look, I experienced frame rate issues with other emulators but not this one and generally easy to use. If you had a ds younger and it broke and you want to play your old ds games without spending 300$ this is a good option.

Can you make a way on how to support the .sav file? naming file extension to vice versa won't work on the application. Make it and I will give you 5 Stars. Thanks!

Runs, great, Runs great. It's fast, and I haven't experienced a crash yet. I just wish it supported wifi use
problem, major, I have one major problem... I just don't know where to get the games at, and they don't make it very clear or even provide a link to anything. Also I looked up stuff on youtube and google to find answers but it's always just a download link to a malware. If you could provide literally anything explaining how to SAFELY download the actual games it would be very helpful.

Also I looked up stuff on youtube and google to find answers but it's always just a download link to a malware. If you could provide literally anything explaining how to SAFELY download the actual games it would be very helpful.
app, payed, The app won't stop crashing... I'm disappointed because it worked super well for a couple of days and now I just can't open anything without it crashing, and considering this is a payed app I feel a bit cheated....
emulator, good, This is a good emulator, but only one problem i got when i play every ds game... The L button automatically touched everytime i press the other buttons... And that was annoying, interupting the gameplay..so, within a few minutes i decided ti refunding it.

pokemon, downloaded, Best $1 ive ever spent. It doesnt lagg, it doesnt crash, and it plays smooth. Ever since i bought this and downloaded pokemon for old time sake, i havent put my phone down. It was like i was a kid again. I cant help but reminisce all the good times i had playing my ds. I love it! If youre thinking of getting it, do it! You wont regret it.

stick, Right, AMAZING APP, only reason that I didn't give it 5 star was I would like a way to use the Right stick (R3) as ABXY as in games like cod black opps you use that to move

emulator, great, This a truly great DS emulator, and for such a cheap price too! I love how all of the cheats are at your disposal from the get go. I've used this emulator to play several games from my childhood, and it hasn't crashed once! If you want a great DS emulator, buy this one!

phone, latest, Really cool and can play on latest phone rather than drastic with no update. Also i may add suggestion to at least allow the ds to trade or battle in pokemon with other user. Overall its still cool but i just hope you will uodate and allow it to support multiplayer. Well, Thank You for an awesome app.

lag, little, (edit) all right. The app actually works amazingly. It was slow to install, and there is a little lag when selecting to load a game other than that frame rates are good and games run smoothly.

emulators, many, It's actually pretty good, many emulators I have to look for the codes online and input them individually. I've only played pokemon black but the codes were already some how preloaded. No need to search the web and input/name them yourself.
emulator, ds, An update d reskin of the DraStic ds emulator. It's cheaper but supports more updates and has more compatibility and crashes less often. xbox controller support is iffy on more intense games like super Mario 64. Would be 5 stars if it wasnt a shameless reskin, but it provides updates that drastic doesnt have

dollar, worth, Deffently the best NDS emulator out there. Its deffently worth your dollar. It can run many files at once and best of all, no lagging when music is played! If I could rate 10 stars, i would.

copy, shameless, I'm going to be honest, the app runs flawlessly. Haven't had a crash whatsoever from when I first bought it. Why am I rating 1 star even though it works flawlessly? This is thanks to the fact that it is a shameless copy of DraStic, plagiarised through and through. Even the directory says DraStic. If you care about DS Emulation, you'll support the original developers instead. I had only come to the realisation that it was a shameless copy after buying it.

bugs, minor, I was planning on going out and buying a DS to relive nostalgia but when I realized I was about to spend $100 I decided I'd try emulators instead, so unbelievably good! Theres a few very minor bugs here and there (some are bugs in the rom) and occasional crash (I had one in the maybe 8 hours I've been playing, so do save often). But for a dollar? Insane quality, I'd easily have spent $10

version, Paid, Very nice and consistent. Anyone know how to change buttons and edit Bluetooth gamepad buttons? Id give it 5 stars then. Paid version.
version, 3DS, I absolutely love this app. The gameplay is smooth, with no latency; and the clarity makes it seem like your phone is an actual Nintendo DS. I hope there will be a 3DS version soon.
deal, good, So, the app does stay true to it's words though, this is a reskin of the more well known, DraStic - DS Emulator. Even the file directory tells you so. Now, I would say this could be a good deal if you wanted the plagarized, cheaper version of an outdated DraStic, you are more than welcome to do so. You may get the same experience as you do for DraStic depending on your hardware. But, if you want software updates and less likely to experience crashes. I would highly recommend DraStic.

emulator, other, Worth the dollar it cost. This is leaps and bounds better than every other emulator I've used on android. For a dollar theres no ads, next to no lag and in many ways runs better than hardware.

emulator, normal, For 99 cents?! Insane value! You'll get your normal emulator hiccups just like any other, but if you know what to expect, this will give you years of entertainment value for basically free. Zero lag even with the speed boost. The app DOES crash very rarely so be sure to keep your save state updated and your hard save as well. If you don't have a DS emulator already, just get this one.

emulator, best, I don't think it's an understatement to say this is the best ds emulator on the play store. All the others are either loaded with ads, laggy, or more commonly, both. This emulator runs games perfectly for just a dollar, with no ads whatsoever. Definitely worth it.
emulator, best, The best ds emulator I ever bought!
emulator, wonderful, Such a wonderful emulator to use only 99¢ and Worth every cent. ☺️
skin, new, This is just the DraStic emulator with a new skin
ads, clean, It is good so far plus its compatible with controller, I love how the screen its clean no ads or anything only the game ✋😌

emulator, good, Congratulations, you made a emulator that crashes every time you start a game, honestly it's a good emulator, but it definitely crashes a lot for me, not sure why, I have no cheats or anything on, just plain old vDS Emulator, so, not too happy
layouts, customizable, Works amazing, well worth the money. Has alittle ways to go before it can match Drastic but it's cheap. But one thing I would like to see is customizable button layouts.
cuesta, dólar, Realmente muy bueno... Lo recomiendo mucho y para 1 dólar que cuesta... Está dpm...

copy, drastic, First of all this application is stolen because this is a drastic emulator copy and paste, the ui is the same, controls and settings, practically everything is different except the startup menu is changed just to cover-up that they don't own this code that they "made". But the fortunate thing about this emulator that it partially works and is much more cheaper then the drastic emulator itself, so it depends for the consumer to decide, to pay for a cheaper app or a more expensive app.

data, save, I gotta say, this emulator is by far my favorite , i just have on question/ problem, but is there a way to carry save data over, like if i got a new phone, and got the app again would i be able to resume right where i left off on pokemon on my old phone

emulator, best, Very good hands down best NDS emulator
instructions, clear, No clear instructions on how to get the games to play and how to use the app paid money and can't play because it doesn't tell you how
system, clean, Runs games well, clean system set up, over all performance is good, easy to use, and has some prebuilt codes to use with games if you feel like it. Honestly it is worth what I paid for it and I wouldn't think twice about reccomending it to others.
issues, real, Runs really well on my device. I have no real issues against it except it doesn't have multiplayer and wifi support. If we could get an update with those in the future for wiimmfi this emulator would easily be 10/10. Look at how melon DS implemented wifi emulation if you need to.
addition, awesome, It can be kinda laggy sometimes. Also, if it had a game speed multiplayer would be an awesome addition. Otherwise it's a really great app to use

route, free, Tried the free route for emulators and few of them were good. Drastic didn't seem all that good for the price so I decided to try out this for only a dollar. Seems amazing so far for being so cheap
button, x2, Best $1 I ever spent! It has a x2 speed button! <3 and does not slow down unlike other emulators!

android, cheap, Works great. I have a cheap ass android after my iPhone bit the dust and iPhone doesn't allow you to use emulators, so the first thing I did was purchase this emulator. I've had a great time playing Pokemon Platinum f8r the first time in years and everything is easy to use and self explanatory, I understand you can also buy a controller and have an easier time playing the harder games, so kudos for that as well.

emulator, Great, This should be rated 5 by all. Great emulator, played through both Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver with no issues. You can customise layout, and ffw gameplay at the boring bits. Excellent app, thanks devs!

graphics, Amazing, I literally only just now downloaded this app and I know from experience it's one of the keepers. Amazing graphics, cheats, fast forward function, no lag, etc. The list really goes on. And it's just a buck. NDS fans GET THIS APP!

copy, illegal, illegal copy of DraStic
function, forward, The fast forward function works better than any other emulator I've tried. After about 8 hours of use total no crashes, no ads, and no problems. Can't beat the value here.

games, sonic, I was weary bc the price sounded too good to be true but it works really well!! I play sonic games on this mofo and I cant wait to experience the catalog the DS has but the only thing I dislike is that sometimes every now and then the load and save states dont work that well but other than that I recommend it for the price

room, extra, Its said "waiting for download" 15 min now Edit: Still waiting. 4GB of extra room
latency, sound, The sound latency is not good and I can get a better experience on a free emulator.

emulator, ds, This app is awesome! For 1$ you get a ds emulator with lots of settings to get games running just as tou want on your device. Id definitely recommend this. Been using it to play dragon quest at a way higher resolution than it was made for and it feels like I'm playing a Playstation 2 game with all the graphical tweaks I've made! It has great Bluetooth support by the way

apps, only, Pretty good one of the only apps that lets you moves the controls and screens. Only problem is that it May crash .but rarely

offline, playable, This Emulator Is worth you money if you know how to use it. It has no ads and is playable offline. It has plenty of settings to make your experience better than the other DS emulators.

codes, preset, Only got the app very recently, and I was a tad anxious due to the lack of reviews, but so far the app has been working very well. A lack of ads, a number of preset cheat codes you can easily turn on or off, and a simple/reliable setup for choosing a game (and actually playing it) makes this a worthy buy. All of this for only a dollar too, simply wonderful. Plus, unlike the other emulators, it is actually made for the current version of Android.
