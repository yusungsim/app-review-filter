love, in, game, This game is so good. I love it so much! I love all the music in the game it's so good!
grew, with, game, I practically grew up with this game. It's shaped me a lot, and I'd be lying if I said it weren't a good game. I also don't get why people get mad at the micro-transactions, as it isn't like EA where you have to pay to get better at the game, they're just texture packs and skin packs that barely affect the gameplay. You're also not forced into buying anything. Sure, the game has a few glitches and bugs, but that's mostly when you're in a beta version. All in all, I highly recommend this game

added, to, world, The nether update , made a lot of fun challenges and cool builds. Now the fox update , had cuddly little foxes and a new food source. Finally the the village and pillage update , added new enemies and better textures to the world and the villagers finally get some new upgrades. All in all this is the best game in my opinion... I'm back and you guys are over working yourselves!!! I have seen all the things you are working on like caves and cliffs. Your even making a very unique, scary, deep dark.

holds, to, me, It doesn't respond sometimes, but all in all the game is great. Lags here and there, but that was already expected. The features are good and are really fun, but i never finish my builds because im to distracted. Most of my builds are unfinished and i can't deny that i'd rather watch minecraft content than play the game itself, but i love this game, because i grew up with. I've been playing the game since i was in 4th grade and altgough i don't play as much it still holds value to me.
checked, on, store, I personally love Minecraft but today when I created a new world it started to lag and lag even though I have internet still this game does not need internet to work then the game kicked me out I checked on the Google play store many times and I don't see a new update for this app. I really hope that this can get fixed I really do love Minecraft.
get, in, Servers, I think it's a really good game but in Servers it can get very laggy ,other than that its A great game

write, in, book, 1. I am unable to rename stuff using an anvil. 2. When I write in a book, close it, and reopen it, none of my writing saves. These are my only problems, and they are in my Realm. Just my Realm.
left, for, hours, I really like this game! But, there is one weird problem. So when I built my house, I left the game for 3 hours, when I came back to check on my house, part of the floor was smashed, the anvil was missing and the stairs were gone. The thing is that I have a brother who can join my world, but when I discovered it, I looked at the chat and no one had joined. This couldn't have been Herobrine because I know he got removed in like 1.16, and this is not the first time this happened to me. Please fix!

play, with, controller, TERRIBLE Played this game for 10+ years and just bought on android to play with my xbox controller. Found out that there's NO way to turn off vibration when destroying blocks when playing with controller after hours of trying to fix this issue. Im SHOCKED that this has not been fixed as this has been out for years on android!

BOUGHT, FOR, ye, BEST GAME EVER I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR 20$ ye that's how good it is
respond, with, snarky, This is a fantastic game, however my only irrational complaint is the devs and support team. Whenever me or anyone I know needs a bit of help and emails em, they ALWAYS respond with this snarky, lazy tone. I know all support teams are like that, but honestly I thought Minecraft would be different. Also they usually aren't helpful at all and the only thing they reccomend is to try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Thank god I tend to he good with computers tbh because they really don't help

played, on, console, In my opinion, this is a well put together game. I've played minecraft on console, and yes, the mobile version is different, but in my opinion it is better than console.
played, for, years, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.

need, as, version, Have really enjoyed playing this game! My main complaint is that the axlotyls aren't catchable with the buckets. A glitch maybe? Should anyone need this info tho... as a cheaper version of minecraft: yes, u will get less options on this app. Still great tho. Better than not having minecraft at all. XD
rotating, like, moon, 2 things I want them to add. I wish they would add rotating Pistons and space like the moon and only the moon and not like rockets like you build up to the moon And you have to be wearing armor

played, on, phone, I love to played this game on my old phone which has lower specs than my current phone, but the oddly thing is, this game runs quite laggy tho my phone is capable enav n' didn't use any single of shaders, textures or whatsoever.. so I just wanna say.. why???
got, for, treat, Really good my kids love it we set up a chore list and if they got it. Done they had got mine coins for a treat and it's been a good way to get them to do there chores with out throwing a fit
working, on, mobile, Great game but for some reason the music stopped working on mobile
raised, for, reason, Good but they raised the price for no reason. This app is not worth 7.49. Put it back to 6.99. 50 cents doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that most players are young.

add, to, game, I like minecraft very much, everything is very good except that I think you could add copper tools and armour to the game, that could be the update 1.18, everyone would want to buy minecraft.
made, from, bamboo, Definitely one of my favourite games, however with the new update traveling will be hard, maybe adding something such as a rod (made perhaps from bamboo) that you can use to launch you up a few blocks, like the sport.

play, on, PS3, Minecraft has always been one of my favorite games and I had to play on my PS3 because I didn't have any other consoles. And I didn't have money to buy minecraft on my phone but I got money and I played it. It was a really good experience and anyone who is reading this you should buy it. You won't regret it.

build, with, friends, I love this game its so so fun i can build anything i want with my friends and i have so much fun. It has a lot of glitches, witch some glitches are good some are bad. For instance, when you could glitch pistons so they have no head, but, however it can be used for a glitch to break bedrock. Its very good if you are on Java Edition, but i play on Bedrock Edition so its usless... for me. And I've only found diamonds 2 times in my life, so its realy hard to find diamonds. Ok bye.

play, on, Edition, I love this game its so so fun i can build anything i want with my friends and i have so much fun. It has a lot of glitches, witch some glitches are good some are bad. For instance, when you could glitch pistons so they have no head, but, however it can be used for a glitch to break bedrock. Its very good if you are on Java Edition, but i play on Bedrock Edition so its usless... for me. And I've only found diamonds 2 times in my life, so its realy hard to find diamonds. Ok bye.
