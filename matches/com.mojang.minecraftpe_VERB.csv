looking, for, Netheright, Hi so last night I was playing Minecraft and I think I may have found a bug. I was in the nether looking for Netheright and all the sudden I died. It said that I died from Lava, but there was nothing there. I lost all of my stuff. Is there any way I can get my stuff back? It's a no cheats survival.

play, on, pc, A very very nice game but difficult to play on pc using emulator. This was my favourite game until something strange happened in java edition. When the dragon was over and i was returning to my world i read the story that came infront of me after reading half of it some words started flickering. I was very scared and did not played java edition since then. And i also got a blood moon in the same version that day.

access, to, 😖, Nice 👍🏻 Game! Everything is good perfect and comfortable 💞 BUT I gave this game 4 🌟 s cause there should be a tool that can be used to decorate blocks.. I know that there is a mod 'chisel and bits mod' which is only for PC USERS!? I don't like that because mobile users cannot access to that mod 😖 please put a tool that can decorate blocks without any mod like that chisel and bits one.

played, on, console, In my opinion, this is a well put together game. I've played minecraft on console, and yes, the mobile version is different, but in my opinion it is better than console.
played, for, years, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.
play, on, it, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.

took, At, me, At the ender dragon me and my brother took one hour to just defeat the ender dragon
need, as, version, Have really enjoyed playing this game! My main complaint is that the axlotyls aren't catchable with the buckets. A glitch maybe? Should anyone need this info tho... as a cheaper version of minecraft: yes, u will get less options on this app. Still great tho. Better than not having minecraft at all. XD
rotating, like, moon, 2 things I want them to add. I wish they would add rotating Pistons and space like the moon and only the moon and not like rockets like you build up to the moon And you have to be wearing armor

Agree, With, Anyone, It is a Great Game To Try Out And Has a lot of colorful feautures and its Graphics and I would Agree With Anyone who is willing to like minecraft because of this
play, because, it, So when ever I go to Change my skin, and I finish, it says it needs to update, and that marketplace isn't available. Even though there is no update available for me. And I can't play Minecraft because of it. Please fix this

disabled, on, bedrock, Not as good as java lmao but still a fun game with amazing servers. I would like it more if axes disabled shields on bedrock because shields are currently over powered
hookup, to, phone, Minecraft keeps glitching out and only letting me move one way and if I try to hookup a controller to my phone and play it just makes me face up
recommend, to, you, Really really good. I would recommend it to you! 😄
crashes, without, reason, It's very fun to build and it's easy to learn how to play me and my brother have been playing it none stop sometimes our servers crashes without a reason but it's fine we get back on and it's fine.
quits, After, year, After a year or two the game just quits on you and deletes all your stuff

played, on, phone, I love to played this game on my old phone which has lower specs than my current phone, but the oddly thing is, this game runs quite laggy tho my phone is capable enav n' didn't use any single of shaders, textures or whatsoever.. so I just wanna say.. why???
got, for, treat, Really good my kids love it we set up a chore list and if they got it. Done they had got mine coins for a treat and it's been a good way to get them to do there chores with out throwing a fit
working, on, mobile, Great game but for some reason the music stopped working on mobile
raised, for, reason, Good but they raised the price for no reason. This app is not worth 7.49. Put it back to 6.99. 50 cents doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that most players are young.
