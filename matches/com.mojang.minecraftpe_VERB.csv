looking, for, Netheright, Hi so last night I was playing Minecraft and I think I may have found a bug. I was in the nether looking for Netheright and all the sudden I died. It said that I died from Lava, but there was nothing there. I lost all of my stuff. Is there any way I can get my stuff back? It's a no cheats survival.

play, on, pc, A very very nice game but difficult to play on pc using emulator. This was my favourite game until something strange happened in java edition. When the dragon was over and i was returning to my world i read the story that came infront of me after reading half of it some words started flickering. I was very scared and did not played java edition since then. And i also got a blood moon in the same version that day.

access, to, 😖, Nice 👍🏻 Game! Everything is good perfect and comfortable 💞 BUT I gave this game 4 🌟 s cause there should be a tool that can be used to decorate blocks.. I know that there is a mod 'chisel and bits mod' which is only for PC USERS!? I don't like that because mobile users cannot access to that mod 😖 please put a tool that can decorate blocks without any mod like that chisel and bits one.

played, on, console, In my opinion, this is a well put together game. I've played minecraft on console, and yes, the mobile version is different, but in my opinion it is better than console.
played, for, years, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.
play, on, it, Minecraft now I have played it for about six years, and on my ipad and I didn't play on it for about 1 year and when I went back on one day, and the grass was like a winter grass nice in pale. Also I forgot to mention it started to glitch an awful lot and it started to be annoying to play on my ipad so I play on my xbox now, and I already tried to uninstall and reinstall, but alas that didn't work either.

took, At, me, At the ender dragon me and my brother took one hour to just defeat the ender dragon
need, as, version, Have really enjoyed playing this game! My main complaint is that the axlotyls aren't catchable with the buckets. A glitch maybe? Should anyone need this info tho... as a cheaper version of minecraft: yes, u will get less options on this app. Still great tho. Better than not having minecraft at all. XD
rotating, like, moon, 2 things I want them to add. I wish they would add rotating Pistons and space like the moon and only the moon and not like rockets like you build up to the moon And you have to be wearing armor

Agree, With, Anyone, It is a Great Game To Try Out And Has a lot of colorful feautures and its Graphics and I would Agree With Anyone who is willing to like minecraft because of this
play, because, it, So when ever I go to Change my skin, and I finish, it says it needs to update, and that marketplace isn't available. Even though there is no update available for me. And I can't play Minecraft because of it. Please fix this

disabled, on, bedrock, Not as good as java lmao but still a fun game with amazing servers. I would like it more if axes disabled shields on bedrock because shields are currently over powered
hookup, to, phone, Minecraft keeps glitching out and only letting me move one way and if I try to hookup a controller to my phone and play it just makes me face up
recommend, to, you, Really really good. I would recommend it to you! 😄
crashes, without, reason, It's very fun to build and it's easy to learn how to play me and my brother have been playing it none stop sometimes our servers crashes without a reason but it's fine we get back on and it's fine.
quits, After, year, After a year or two the game just quits on you and deletes all your stuff

played, on, phone, I love to played this game on my old phone which has lower specs than my current phone, but the oddly thing is, this game runs quite laggy tho my phone is capable enav n' didn't use any single of shaders, textures or whatsoever.. so I just wanna say.. why???
got, for, treat, Really good my kids love it we set up a chore list and if they got it. Done they had got mine coins for a treat and it's been a good way to get them to do there chores with out throwing a fit
working, on, mobile, Great game but for some reason the music stopped working on mobile
raised, for, reason, Good but they raised the price for no reason. This app is not worth 7.49. Put it back to 6.99. 50 cents doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that most players are young.

add, to, game, I like minecraft very much, everything is very good except that I think you could add copper tools and armour to the game, that could be the update 1.18, everyone would want to buy minecraft.
made, from, bamboo, Definitely one of my favourite games, however with the new update traveling will be hard, maybe adding something such as a rod (made perhaps from bamboo) that you can use to launch you up a few blocks, like the sport.

play, with, brother, It's a very fun game and I mostly play it with my brother. But why skin packs and game mods need to use mine coins that cost money. But overall it very fun 🙂
play, on, PS3, Minecraft has always been one of my favorite games and I had to play on my PS3 because I didn't have any other consoles. And I didn't have money to buy minecraft on my phone but I got money and I played it. It was a really good experience and anyone who is reading this you should buy it. You won't regret it.

pirated, from, source, Would have given 5 star but it said We think you have pirated minecraft from a different source Which i did not do Please fic this
installed, from, store, It's Minecraft Bedrock just like from other ports. But goodluck if you're gonna have a bunch of packs installed both from the store and 3rd party. Because deleting and modifying them takes ages. It took a solid 50 min for my sd 860 phone just to delete a freshly modded and made world with barely any progress done.

got, from, place, The game is great but the market place is an absolute worst. the market place is a place of scam, no achievements, no access to the mod, no refund. better to just play normal world, i got everything in hard-mode normal world and all i got from market place is regret.
make, into, character, They should redo my sims agents and make them into minecraft character
play, with, friends, Amazing app this is one of my favorite games to play with my friends and family.
build, with, friends, I love this game its so so fun i can build anything i want with my friends and i have so much fun. It has a lot of glitches, witch some glitches are good some are bad. For instance, when you could glitch pistons so they have no head, but, however it can be used for a glitch to break bedrock. Its very good if you are on Java Edition, but i play on Bedrock Edition so its usless... for me. And I've only found diamonds 2 times in my life, so its realy hard to find diamonds. Ok bye.

sleep, at, time, The best thing about minecraft is that you can literally do anything you want, without the game telling you to not do and it has no limit. But there are some bad features about it too, you can never sleep at day time, it takes 3-5 minutes to leave the world and it sometimes kicks you out of your account and wait 1-2 minutes for it to log back in. Minecraft is still the best game, even thought there some features that I don't like about, but it's still better than any other.

play, with, data, Cant play multiplayer with mobile data, only wifi.
needs, to, dog, MINECRAFT, needs a pet upgrade to specifically the dog. Allow an equipment slot for maybe lether or chainmail even special "dog armor". Just my suggestion for a small but amazing upgrade to the game.
