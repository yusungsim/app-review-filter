is, time, 3rd, This, This is now the 3rd time I've bought & played Terraria (PS3, PC, & now mobile). It's worth every penny. Developers that support their products like this, are far and few between. Also any mobile game that realizes the importance of controller support, is to be applauded. There's so much to do & so much content to dig up. In fact, my only sort of gripe with the game is that you can easily get mired down with your to do list. EASILY THE BEST STAND ALONE GAME PURCHASE I'VE MADE ON MOBILE.
is, person, fake, this, Very good I am not lying this is not a fake person I'm serious Ok if you don't believe me with a fake person be able to do this :((())))))))
be, process, simple, It, I want to give a 5-star review, but I can't because of their multi-player confusion. I have spent 15 minutes just trying to play this game with a friend who is not local, and every how-to video says I need to download this or sign up for that. It should be a very simple process.
is, game, amazing, this, I've played terraria for many years and it's been a really fun game,My only problem is that the PC version is 1.4.3 and has a bunch of items mobile doesnt because mobile is 1.4,But this is still an amazing game :)
is, game, best, this, I have about 500 hours on PC and 300 in mobile and I can say this is the best game I have ever played
's, game, nice, It, It's a super nice game but there is a bug Ware if you hit default settings it will not do anything.
is, game, good, It, It is a good game but it can be hard sometimes you can play with to friends are by yourself.
's, game, good, It, It's really good game, but no google drive save support (yet?), so I can't safely continue my save game on other devices if something happened to my phone. Pointless to play. Dear Dev, please make save/load (or maybe export/import save) to google drive. I refunded because of this reason.
's, game, relatable, It, Terraria is a fun game that sometimes leaves me wondering ,this game was made in 2013? It's a very relatable game for me. I have 180 hours in it, Fun game this one.
's, game, favorite, It, I unfortunately don't have Terraria on mobile but I wanted to rate it. It's my favorite game to play it's got everything a good survival crafting game can offer. Also not to mention there is so many items and enemies that I could play for a week and never be bored like it's so addictive.
is, game, pixelated, it, Love how it is a 2d pixelated game with an open world, customizable character, world editor, and many bosses, tools, and cool thing like the "Eye of Chulthulu" or something like that.
's, thing, greatest, it, I like Terraria and I really wanted to play and now I just don't want to play it I want to literally get inside the game and Crush myself I mean by being stuck inside wait forever I love this game so much is the best game ever it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you mad at you are the best game ever and I now have to said this is the best game ever but I care that has how much I like this came it's the best thing ever

is, game, awesome, It, It is a awesome game
's, port, decent, It, It's a pretty decent mobile port, though I kind of wish the google play achivements were re-linked so they'd be obtainable again.

is, version, ported, This, This is a really well ported version of terraria, I miss the tutorial version though
is, game, favorite, It, It is my 2# favorite game
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing survival game, especially once you activate hard mode, I recommend this to people who want a difficult challenge or a just something to do to pass time.
was, kid, stupid, I, I'm sorry about my old review I was a stupid kid with a bad phone that messed up my saves I love this game again sorry
's, buuut, good, It, It's a good game buuut if it is possible or can be possible can there be mods in the game? If not then thats ok
is, record, new, that, What's not to like? It has 4 out of the 20 things i desire in a game and that is a new record for me in terms of games.
's, game, good, it, Well, it's a good game overall. But the problem is it's hard to play with my friends..I wish it was easier to host and join even they're away from me...
was, game, favorite, This, This was by far my favorite mobile game. Untill that is, the update. Controls are unrecognizable, and I cannot play at all.

was, fun, much, it, I love this game I played it on my Xbox through the Xbox game pass ultimate and I was amazed with how much fun it was. Plus Minecraft and terraria both are good games. One time Minecraft had a splash text saying "go play tarraria too" and terraria had a splash text saying "try playing Minecraft too" so I think they are both excellent game's.

's, game, cool, It, It's a pretty cool game, I like it. Even with Journey mode i still have plenty of fun Myth-Busting things!
is, update, final, this, I love this game im very very sad that this is the final update i rember playing with my friend on this game.well Terraria goodbye
is, game, fun, It, It is a very fun game i beat it i have like 4 Zeniths now i feel great
's, game, fun, it, Four stars it's a fun game to play on and you can do many things, but there's some things that could possibly fixed(1) I can't exactly record videos on terraria (2) it only lets me play for about an hour until it crashes(3) the multi player thing is hard to use, but overall it's very great.
's, game, good, it, It's alright but it's still a good game
is, game, fantastic, It, It really is a fantastic game, but one thing that relly is getting on my nerves...WHY THE HECK DOES IT NOT WORK WITH BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE LOL REFUND
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game over-all. It took me over three months to fully see what the game had to offer, spending 4 to 7 hours on it a day. It's got enough secrets and gear to keep you captivated for a lifetime. However, there are many complications for multiplayer, especially for mobile. I actually came to the game page to try and download it onto my computer, only to have it not listed as an option. It really is too bad. I was really hoping to be able to upload my most played worlds my computer, so I'm not always trying to look into a tiny screen (which I fully understand is a given for mobile games). The point is, multiplayer's tricky; and cross-platform, forget about it. Other than that, easy 5 stars. Literally the best mobile game I've ever had the honor of owning.
is, game, good, This, This is a very good game but I am a bit sad how I couldn't save my data from my old phone to this, but still it allows me to do the challenge again
is, masterpiece, rpg, this, this is an rpg sandbox masterpiece. thousands of items, over 25 bosses, and TONS of things to do. the only real complaint i have is the massive ui on this mobile version, makes it real hard to see.
was, space, enough, it, I deleted you and it said it was enough space so i try and download then need more space
is, game, vary, It, It is a vary good game but I wish they would continue updating the game though

's, game, good, It, It's a very good game but i can't summon a solar eclipse
is, game, gud, It, It is a gud game
's, game, great, It, It's a great game.
is, game, good, this, This is really exaggerating the gameplay is Soo fun its really good for people who have a bad computer the reason I give 4 stars is because you can't save data system in the game but this is a really good and fun game I definitely recommend it to all people who like this kind of games.
is, game, funnest, This, I honestly love this game! There are hundreds of critters and monsters to discover, and there are over 30 bosses to defeat. This is the funnest game I've had in months.
is, game, favorite, This, This is my favorite game ever
is, complaint, common, this, I want to see a way to change the resolution the game decides to use..  I don't Want to play the game cause its to zoomed in to  really see what is going on..  I'm kind of surprised  this isn't a common complaint?
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game and I think you must make more updates
's, game, good, It, It's a good game, would highly recommend to people who love fighting bosses and create a thriving town in their world.
is, button, literal, it, Why woulf you change the controls it is so much more dificult now (ex: a literal jump button you hust had to move the left stick before) im sorry it just dosent really work for me that much edit like 2 years after redownload I've gotten used to it
's, game, good, It, It's a realy good game you get to go on journey mode you get to go on classic mediumcore and hardcore mode you can do journey mode, normal mode, expert mode, and master mode and I got the zenith it's hard but I got my hard work and I am proud.
am, person, only, I, Terraria fails to install now I have updated to android 11. Will there be a fix for this or have I wasted my money. I am not the only person with this issue.
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game. I know your not going, but you should change up the world generation.
's, game, fun, It, It's just a fun great game and I love playing it with my family and it's a hard game which I think hard games are better

is, Game, Great, This, Note: The Reviews here aren't Bots. This is just a legitimately Great Game. The touch Screen may be Complicated for some people, So just use Controller :D Also- This game is for PC Xbox and 360, So obviously it's going to be worth it's price for Mobile. Buy it RN, You won't regret it.
is, game, good, it, I love this game a lot i think it is a very good game how every i dont like the phone version a lot. I like it on the xbox and pc tho but it is still a good game 😄😄😄😄😄

's, port, good, it, The game is great, and it's a pretty good port, but I just cannot find a good enough reason to buy it when I have better systems that can give me the same experience. Even though it's not my favorite version, it's still worth the money if you don't have a PC or a console.

is, game, fun, This, This is a fun game and all, but the controls are pretty hard to get used to, especially when I normally play on nintendo switch. Also, the game randomly closes on me and takes me back to my home screen and I don't know why. Also, I can't select any mode except for journey. Other than these issues, great game! I would also like to see Journeys End come to console (along with lots of other people.) Great job tho. Edit: PLEASE PUT 1.4 ON SWITCH! I WOULD LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game very well made. There are really no problems with it, and a mobile game everyone can actually enjoy! Thank you 505 games!!
's, game, fun, It, It's a very fun game I've played it on my sister's device but when I try to get in it tells me to retry I did every thing it wants but pls pls help me
is, game, good, It, This is one of the best, might be the best game I ever played. 10/10 worth the payment, extremely recommended game. It's hard at first, but once you did progress, you become very obsessed with this game and having fun with it. It is also a good game to play whenever you're free. It works excellent on poor devices
's, game, good, it, Make Terraria first person 3D bunch of people would play I was wondering if you could make a future where you can sync your account to your Xbox account in Terraria so you have all your progress on your mobile phone link it to your Xbox account you should keep on updating this game cuz it's a really good game please and thank you oh yeah there's a game on Xbox One there our copying your game it came out on 2020 and they I have a 2 star review 1
is, call, close, this, Its great multiplayer lots of boses this is a close call but its as great or even better than Minecraft and thats hard for a game the creators did a wonderful job but its not for under 7ns its prety scary at that age all in all great game
am, player, long, I, Hi I am long time player and this is a great game very fun and all the people that think Minecraft and others are better are wrong I think Terraria and Minecraft are equal and some of the other games are worse (others are equal) great game

's, game, good, it, I love this game but the controller's are not good but it's a really good game but i rather play it on my switch and if you don't like minecraft then try this game don't make fun of the creators they tried their best
been, experience, amazing, they, Games amazing I own this game on five different platforms and they've all been an amazing experience. Soon however there will come a time where I don't play on mobile anymore as the Steam Deck isn't too far away. It's been a fun time playing on mobile tho. Much love to everyone who worked on this amazing game, I feel like my live would be different without. Considering several days of my life have been spent playing this. Thanks again for making my favorite game.
