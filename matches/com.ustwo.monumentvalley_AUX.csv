was, experience, charming, It, Short and sweet or a good way to fill time. It was a charming and fulfilling experience from start to finish. A lot head-scratching puzzles to keep your gear turning. I am glad there is a sequel(I've already bought it).
's, game, okay, It, It's an okay game but it's not nearly as long as it should be for a paid app, and the fact that you're asked to pay for extra levels once you've already paid to download the game? I found that to be outrageous. Don't buy this game if you're expecting hours of fun. You get maybe one hour of game play and then have to pay for more.
's, thing, bad, that, Beautiful, peaceful game with some very nice storytelling. I agree with some reviews that it's not very difficult, but I don't think that's a bad thing, it's sort of a meditative experience.
's, gameplay, pure, It, I absolutely love this game I see no problems with it, there's no ads and no bugs from my knowledge. It's just pure gameplay and I find it really cool that the levels are set up the way they are, and how there are so many illusions included in one level! If you're looking for a fun puzzle game this is definitely what you want!

be, game, logic, This, This could be a logic game (if it is you can improve it) :D
's, time, confusing, It, It's confusing time. The illusions are killing me. You know sometime I have to rotate my phone to understand and solve the puzzle.
's, hours, few, It, Tranquil and challenging This is a relaxing yet slightly challenging game. Best played with headphones. It's a few hours of fun. Fun to go back and play again after a few months.
are, value, great, this, Simply brilliant. Simple and brilliant. I rarely pay for mobile games, but this and the follow up are great value for money.
's, experience, good, It, This is incredibly short and in my opinion barely a puzzle game until the last level. This may just be my experience because I downloaded this off of the "top puzzle games" page. It's a good experience but I can't help but walk away without thinking that this was just a pretentious game of "find the button to click".

's, truth, brutal, that, I am not a gamer, just a busy German Mother who does not take time for anything! But this game captured me, it's very detailed with the blowing skirt and dangling legs. I think the creators should get a reward for this outstanding game. Keep up the good work! I am intrigued by your skills! And that's the brutal truth!
's, game, relaxing, It, Really great, the music and art are wonderful. It's not too difficult; a very relaxing game. Completely worth the price, even for all of them- I only wish there more Monument Valley games!

is, time, 5the, it, This is a game puzzles it is my 5the time solving it i love that game
's, game, logical, It, It's simply just perfect. I love the calm soundtracks, too, all the ideas behind it, the story, the- the... everything. It's a logical game and it's nothing for the price! It's just so good!
's, game, great, It, It's a great game! I only wish it was longer.
's, game, amazing, It, It's such an amazing game, even tho most of levels aren't difficult but the styles and sounds very terrific
is, game, fun, This, This is a fun game! I would definitely say that it isn't for everyone but I do suggest it.
's, game, beautiful, it, i adore this game so much, it's definitely the most beautiful game i've ever played. it's so calming and it makes you think, and it's just amazing. 10000/10 recommend.
is, game, cute, This, This is such a cute little game. I could sit and play these all day every day. I don't know that I would pay for the little amount there is to do, but if there was a daily puzzle or a lot more chapters I would for sure pay a small one time fee.

was, game, best, That, That was the best game I ve ever played thanks for Makin it good and I will definitely buy the second version ❤❤
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game and really puts your imagination to the rest! I used to play this a long time ago but just recently re-downloaded it. Once you get the gist of it you can go through it quickly, but the fact that there are different levels with different difficulties is really great!
's, game, creative, it, An Awesome indie game you actually have to make part 3 it's so awesome a creative game and some much of thinking in my opinion in this 3D world liked the idea and the gameplay I'm actually a fan of this series right now i hope you make part 3 soon with more dlcs and levels and continue making games like this and more series you actually can do it
's, fun, much, it, Such a cool idea to build a game based on an optical illusion, and it's so much fun! Perfect level of difficulty all the way through, including Forgotten Shores. I can't even imagine conceptualizing and designing the levels; it must've been a huge challenge to make this game. I also love the atmosphere, the music, and the sound design. Looking forward to playing the second one.

is, game, AMAIZING, this, My Truly respect and congratulations to.the creator, this is an AMAIZING geometric game

is, game, stunning, This, I don't normally rate apps, but this is one really is beautiful. The advanced graphics and the simplicity of the concept to this puzzle game is an intriguing contradiction. The puzzles themselves are complex, so you're in for a cranial workout. This is a visually stunning game.
is, game, cool, This, This is such a cool game.
is, game, immersive, It, The game is truly incredible. It is a really immersive, challenging but rewarding game. Music is wonderful and it's very relaxing. Gave 4 stars because it's just kind of weird to pay $5 for a game that you can completely finish in one sitting.
is, franchise, great, This, Enjoyable! I completed the game in two days time including the dlc and the side story with a total of about 1 1/2hrs to 2hrs. Then I played MV2 and completed that in a day. This is one great franchise to continue on with, I will be looking forward to seeing MV 3, 4 and so on... I'm ready for a storyline with twins searching for each other as they use the elements. You could introduce an app where we could create levels that could be playable by others with each new game that's released.
is, sooo, peacful, it, It's one of the best relaxing game ever! I love how it is sooo peacful
is, game, favorite, this, this is literally my favorite mobile game of all time
is, game, mobile, this, this is literally my favorite mobile game of all time
is, definition, real, this, this is the real definition of mind blowing games. saying this one is a great game would be an insult, since this game was really well made. not to mention there is no ads in the game. that's just crazy. if i could give a 10 stars, i'd give 12.
is, game, favourite, this, Wow beautiful just beautiful this is my favourite game next to little nightmares! Its such a time killer and you can play it anywhere you want!!!! And its only $3 HOW CAN YOU NOT BUY IT
is, game, great, This, This is a great game, but unfortunately, as someone with experience with non-euclidean and perspective based puzzle games (Portal, Superliminal, and Light Matter) the majority of the levels were very easy. With the exception of the final level in both the base game and paid DLC, and the Citadel of Deceit (which I particularly enjoyed), no other levels felt even remotely challenging
is, way, grate, This, This is a grate way to work your mind just enough to sharpen it i love it
is, beauty, ultimate, It, It is the ultimate beauty. Good design.
is, way, short, it, While I enjoyed the game it is way, way too short for a game that costs $6. It has only 10 levels and while they are very pretty they are not overly challenging so you get through them very quickly. Disappointing.
's, experience, wonderful, It, I love this game wholeheartedly. It's a wonderful experience that's beautiful in every way, and the degree of challenge in the puzzles is perfect.
's, game, beautiful, it, it's a very beautiful game, was disappointed that it's only 10 levels, specially that it's not a free game. i finished it in one seating, i wish it could've been at least 20 levels.

's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game and it's priceless
is, one, only, this, What a gorgeous game. I rarely play games, and I think this is the only one I've ever paid for but it was so worth it. Thank you so much. Can't wait to pay the second version!
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but I completed it in a few days and now I'm bored. And I can't go any further because you have to buy everything
is, game, beautiful, This, This is a visually beautiful game but after a couple of times playing it I got slightly bored.
is, game, beautiful, This, This is a truly beautiful and ingenious game. The narrative is simple but warm. Some of the levels can be a little linear but they're so well designed it's hard not to appreciate. Its simple yet vibrant aesthetic and mind bending architecture bring the world to life. I just wish there was more of it. Edit: There's now more of it 5*
's, reliever, fun, it, A beautiful game, it almost feels like an interactive music box. Not much left to surprise you when you already know the solutions but it's a fun stress reliever to replay
IS, GAME, AMAZING, THIS, THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME! I've only played this for like 10 to 20 minutes and it's already super relaxing and cool!
is, game, best, this, Not exaggerating to say this is the best mobile game I've ever played. Certainly in terms of problem solving. So beautifully crafted - smart, imaginative and with a great atmosphere.

is, game, phenomenal, this, Great, awsome game but the amount of content is a bit lacking if you dont buy the DLC. But other than that this is a phenomenal game
's, experience, amazing, It, It's an amazing game experience with great atmosphere, pretty short tho and you must pay extra for accessing all levels.
's, game, made, It, Good but extremely short. Got through it maybe in less than an hour. Since head scratchers but overall very easy. Was hoping for something like "the room" series level of difficulty. It's a well made game, but really should be twice as long for the price.
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game I really like the graphics and how the controls work.
is, game, beautiful, This, This is by far the most beautiful and intriguing puzzle based game I have ever played. The puzzles are challenging and the solutions really fun. Thank you so much!

's, game, cool, It, It's a very cool, visually stunning game that keeps your brain working. However, for the price, I was expecting more content. Finished in probably ~2hrs total play time.

is, time, second, This, This is the second time I played it since it first came out. It's that good. 👍👍
is, 1.50, extra, which, Really enjoyed this - very relaxing and clever, though if you are used to puzzle games of any sort you'll find this far too easy. Only gets 5 stars for the add on pack which is an extra £1.50. The main game on it's own is good but it's short and finishes just as it seems to be going somewhere interesting. The add on is much more interesting, to me anyway. What there is of the 'story' is pretentious nonsense!
is, game, best, it, I love this game it has a great story line and the art is amazing the way you move around and the characters you meet are awesome the puzzles and monuments are hard but not to hard that you would quit all in all it is the best game you can get on the play store. I love it and I think you would to.
is, game, great, It, It is a great game but when you are finished and bored with it it is sad that you can't get your money back though
is, game, favorite, it, I love this game I have not played it in awhile so this will make my day i will play most it is my favorite game
's, game, good, It, It's a good game, but it needs more levels. As it is, I don't think it's quite worth the money.
was, game, beautiful, It, It was a beautiful game
be, game, second, It, I just played first game so according to this, very best game in mobile. If there will be a game that take the first place, It would be just second game of this. Very best.
is, game, bad, It, The game is absolutely gorgeous, relaxing and mesmerising, all of that is true. That being said, it offers close to no challenge and is rather short. It is not a bad game but it is more of an experience than it is a game in the strictest sense of the term. As long as you're aware of what you're buying you'll probably have a good time with it though.
's, experience, neat, It, It's a neat pocket experience with nice visuals and puzzles created for mobile play in mind.
is, game, amazing, This, This is an exceptionally amazing game! The solutions to the puzzles seem impossible at first, but are so seeming right there as you walk your path and manipulate the path to different view points. How some of them came together had me say "Wow, that's amazing!" on more than one occasion. This game makes your brain have to think outside of the box. One of the greatest games I've ever played. Will absolutely be looking at the developer's other titles. Brilliantly done guys and gals!
's, game, premium, it, By far the best optical illusion game I've ever played. Edit: To those people who rated this game 1 star because they had to pay money to play, it's a premium game. Most good games are pay to play. This is a great game, and if you have to pay, just pay. It's 5 bucks and you get what you pay for. It cost extra to play new levels because they updated it, just like how you still have to pay for DLC's, even if you already bought the game. You're paying extra, for additional content.

is, game, sweet, This, Clean, thoughtful and sacred. This is a sweet little game with a bit of general spirituality to it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and think the developers made this through a labor of love. Really well made, and part 2 is just as good, if not better. Thanks for making this game!

is, game, favourite, This, This is definitely my favourite mobile game of all time. I wish there was more than just the sequel. If you haven't played MV2 yet, go do it now!!
