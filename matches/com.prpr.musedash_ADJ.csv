game, easy, Would be an easy 5 star game if they didn't have every good song behind a paywall 🙃 which I wouldn't mind if the game itself was free, but it isn't, so. I wish I was just being stingy but being from SA makes just one pack cost a luxury. I had fun back when they made entire packs free weekly for covid though

work, AMAZING, Everything about this game like, the graphics, artstyle, gameplay EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL !!!!! IT'S SO ADDICTING!! AMAZING work for the people that made this game. <3
game, Great, This game is a pretty Great rhythm game. I enjoy the simple 2 tap controls and the colorful art style. I just wish the backgrounds had a little more detail or story telling elements. My last gripe with the game which is usually expected but not as bad as you think, the beat sync can be a little off even after manually adjusting. What I wish they would add is an automatic beat sync while playing. Overall I recommend this game.

game, amazing, This is an amazing game. Amazing graphics, music, characters, etc. But theres something I have a problem with. When I Uninstalled the app due to problems with launching the app, it reset me back to level 69 (I was level 101 btw). I lost several characters, several songs, several elfins, and several characters chips and illustrations. Mind you, i was uninformed that itd reset some of my progress. Vv disappointed. Other than that, I'd say it's a pretty good game! I'd 100% recommend to my friends!

time, last, I have this game on here and on steam and before it would let me sync my progress between the two however the last time I tried to play it on here I synced it as usual and it just put me back on level 1 even though both saves were higher level and I can't sync my progress again I'm still the same level on steam which is logged into the same account but level 1 on here now and there's no way to get my progress back.

twitter, official, Problem with cloud save and accounts right now, will update review when bug is fixed. In the meantime I would look on their official twitter or discord for updates
game, Great, Great game, I even bought some add on music. But can accounts transfer from Android to iOS and vice versa
data, lost, Chaged to one star after deleting my cloud save progress and forcing me to start from the beginning. Don't know how you'll restore everyone's lost data since it has been already overwritten. Hours of playtime wasted.
game, Good, My cloud save can sync normally now! Good game and team.
music, more, Love the songs it have, hope it get more music in.

save, local, Game forced me to delete my cloud save. I logged in to my account, and it asked which save I wanted to pick.. no matter what option I picked (cloud save or local save) it kept saying it would select the brand new level 1 account. I force closed the app and it deleted my cloud save. After clearing data and trying to login again, my cloud save is replaced with the level 1 save... Disappointing, it was a fun game up until now.

song, certain, The game is extremely fun if you like Rhythm games. I have 2 complaints though, sometimes when I go to play a song the game crashes or on certain song it will have a annoying static noise. I play on mobile so some of these problems may not occur on other devices. Other than that this is a great game.

game, full, I spend almost 30 dollars to get the full game and all of a sudden it won't let me launch, telling me it needs to update, and sends me to the app store to update. Except there is no option in the app store to update it, when I check for updates the game doesn't show up.
caro, adicional, um dos meus jogos favoritos, porém, o conteúdo adicional é muito caro, no computador estava 100 reais e na promoção 60, já aqui, é quase 150 reais (???)

people, new, Friendly for people new to rhythm games. Can be played with only 2 thumbs as it only has "up" and "down" which is excellent for mobile as it can be played to kill time in commutes or what not (if you are not ashamed of being seen playing an "anime" game that is) When you play the high level stages you'll have to use 4 fingers. Has a large free songs library and has a good offer on all purchasable dlc.

screen, black, Guys, hear me out. If you're stuck on the black screen, open your tab once, and get back in muse dash. It works for me. — oh and to those stupid f2p reviews, of course it's not f2p friendly, what did you expect? stop complaining we don't care if you quit the game

songs, nice, The game is nice, many songs to choose from, and is F2P friendly. I would give it 5 stars, however it seems that if you would like to play on mobile AND PC, then you will run into problems. Save progress does not sync between PC and mobile. Also, if you have bought a DLC on mobile like me, then you must also pay for it on PC, as there is no way to transfer purchases. Apart from this quite annoying issue, the game totally deserves 5 stars!

adjustment, offset, Just bought this game today, enjoying the gameplay and graphics so far but I am having some trouble with the offset adjustment. None of the values seems to work for me and I have been getting greats more than perfects lol. I didn't experience this issue in other mobile rhythm games I play so it is weird (maybe just a lagging issue??) Edit: okay, so I ended up setting my offset value to 0.211 lmao, it works fine now

update, last, I'm not sure if devs read these but I hope they do cause they broke my Tomodachi in the last update. I'll try and be specific, I main sailor suit buro. I'm not sure what happened but now when I hit a sequence note before a long note, she goes into it without an animation. I learned that if there are any other notes after this hold, she breaks her ability and doesn't continue the sequence . This only seems to happen with pink notes, haven't had this issue with blue ones. Please fix 🙏

game, best, This is the best rhythm game I have ever played! Good graphics, good music, everything is good. I wish the girls have more dialogues and voices, that would make the game more lively. I also recommend making a " make-your-own-song " feature so that people can make their own song and beatmaps. I also wish that this game have multiplayers and online battles so that we can battle with other players and friends. Very good game, 5 stars. Definitely would recommended to my friends... if I had one :'(

update, new, Love this game!!! The songs are great and the levels are quite challenging like osu. Also, in the new update I've been recently having a problem with sailor suit buro not hitting the notes that are marked. When I hold a note that is marked, it won't hit the long note after that. This never happened before. So I was confused.

game, fun, very fun game
account, same, I really like the music and have tens of hours in the game on Steam. But hey, devs, be honest with me. Is it really that hard to set up a way to track DLC purchases between platforms? Since I'm using the same account on both devices, and it saves my scores and favourite songs, it seems like a kind of ridiculous notion that it wouldn't be possible to set a flag in the account that tracks unlocks and purchases as well. I'm not suggesting it's easy, but surely it's at the very least possible?

problem, only, This game is so great that the only problem I have is having a hard time to stop. Also, there seems to be many complaints about only having BLACK SCREEN when opening the app, turning on the Fullsreen mode at Advanced Settings for the app fixed it for me. Hope that helps, developers should probably do something about it.

screen, black, The game is great, but for some reason when I try to open it, it won't load, just a black screen, I rebooted my device, deleted app data, but still won't launch, how is this possible in a paid game?

parts, best, I've been playing this game and have been seeing it since it came out and love how simple and yet how hard some of the songs are. The fact that you can play with only two fingers is one of the best parts I think at least. Love the songs and the design of the game in general.
dlc, planned, I have just as planned dlc on pc version but it doesn't show up on mobile even though I've synced my account. Help, please

game, nice, Been loving this game, it's a nice game to chill out to while chilling at work, or waiting for stuff to load.
friends, little, This game is wonderful!! I recommend it to those wanting to try out rhythm games, this one is really addicting, and worth the money. Leveling up can get you characters, little friends that help you, or cool illustrations you can view while the song loads! It's a beautiful experience, there are songs and characters you can purchase, I personally think it's worth it, most importantly, the songs, they're really good and challenging on the difficulties! I totally recommend!

game, good, it's a good game, i really like it. however, the game tends to like to not register my taps from time to time. i even had times where i couldn't move at all and just had to take damage because i couldn't do anything, i couldn't even pause. it's still a great game don't get me wrong, but i might switch over to the pc version. also I don't know why but it fails every so often with synchronisation to my pc, which is a right kick in the balls when you have allot of progress on phone but not on pc.

censorship, Chinese, Chinese censorship ruined this game. Vtubers worldwide were banned from streaming it for the horrible crime of accidentally(!) Acknowledging Taiwan's independence. Seems a little sensitive, no?

rhythm, straightforward, Nice and straightforward rhythm game. Smooth gameplay and graphics. Simple gameplay but can get pretty hard so it's cool. Some cool songs but that's up to one's taste anyway.

game, good, I wish we could play with sleepwalker girl normaly but we cant good game tho
time, long, I really want this game long time ago, and I finally bought it. Overall, the game is fine, there's a lot of songs that you can play but you have to grind lvl to unlock the songs, and surprisingly it's not hard to grind lvl which is great! And there's a lot of song packs too but you have to pay to unlock the packs 👍

game, amazing, A really amazing rythm game, I would even go as far as to say the best on Mobile, but then why a 3 star rating? Well that because I own the dlc on the steam version and similarly I paid here to buy the game too but now the game wants me to buy the dlc in the mobile version too, to play the dlc, that's just absurd, why do i have to pay for the same thing twice when I already own it and paid the game to buy here too, I really hope the Devs sort this out because without that I can't recommend this.

game, good, honestly, really good game besides the fact that it crashes at least 3 times before i can actually play it. once i start up a song, either the audio will completely break, or the game will just crash once i touch the screen. aside from those obvious problems, the art is amazing, the controls are simple and easy, and the songs are super catchy. everything unlocks pretty fast, but it's still fun :)

atmosphere, overall, I like the overall atmosphere of the game, but it feels like I'm getting lag between when I touch my screen and when it registers my touch.

game, pretty, it's a very pretty game with a cute artstyle and pretty characters! I downloaded this for the phigros Collab (I am a big fan of phigros lol and this game has a good reputation) and I liked this game a lot so I decided to buy some more packs. sailor suit buro's ability sometimes makes the game lag though for some reason... it can be fixed by lowering the quality but it isn't as pretty. and sometimes loading can take a while.... still a nice game though

music, cute, Very cute and colorful, great animation/music, BUT big flaw is the best makers are consistently out of beat with the songs! Played around on diff songs and it was noticably off beat on each, making it highly difficult to play properly, sadly.

money, much, Game is fun but theres no way in hell im spending that much money.
news, Good, Good news is, I can play the game the first time it opens. I found out how to make the game work better, so listen up. I turned off the sound effects, it saves the time of fixing the offset and the game won't glitch as much. The game also works better offline, so before playing turn off your internet or such.

boyyyyy, Yeahhhhhh, Yeahhhhhh boyyyyy i love this game so much!
complaint, biggest, The controls are simple and all the artwork is beautiful. You'll unlock everything quickly. idk if it's my phone or the game, but it is easy to accidently hit the home button in the middle of a stage, even with navigation lock on. My biggest complaint is I have to hit the pause button multiple times for it to register. All these waifus but I want at least one husbando XD

inch, missing, I love the game however I wish it could display properly on the Surface duo, vertically it expands fine but horizontally there's about half an inch missing on both sides of the screen, and that hinders the experience a bit. If only there was a way to adjust the ratio...
screen, black, It's a Great Rythm game. But I can't start. I only see a black screen. But it was fun on Steam
fun, super, I extreamly love this game its super fun and i love the songs but its still laggy

Thank you so much for making this game and makes us happy! (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤

Its really annoying when playing high levels. And then the offsets, the default settings are not accurate so you have to calibrate manually and the calibration website for newer phones are not listed yet.(I am on samsung a52 offset 0.050). I hope the newer phones will be listed soon, and the touch respond fixed.

amount, available, The game itself is great with the amount of content available for people who didn't buy any of the DLCs. However, the game only works for the first time you run it, whenever I try to run in a 2nd time, it gets stuck at a black screen. I've tried reinstalling the game twice now, the problem still happens.

game, good, It's good game haven't played much of it but the only issue I have is the song limitations it would be better if it had custom songs or if the game had a way of you getting songs without paying

phone, new, When I got a new phone it ran perfectly but if I had my old phone it probably would've still been a black screen after the loading. Overall I love this game and I hope no serious mess ups happen this time.

thing, only, Game's fun and all but there's a point where there's not much to do, keeping on playing doesn't seem rewarding since the only thing to unlock are wallpapers, and the fact you have to pay to unlock characters in an already paid game is really frustrating.

game, amazing, Muse Dash is an amazing rhythm game. Albeit it's not my type, I definitely had lots of fun on it! I might have a nitpick on framerate but, nothing too shabby. I have bought the Cytus DLC, but, I found out it was a little too difficult for my skill. Regardless, even if I played it a few times, I still enjoyed the game. There's PLENTY of songs to play with weekly free rotations to see which suits your music taste. It's accessible, simple, challenging, yet enjoyable! It's worth your money.

songs, upbeat, June /7/ 2021 I really enjoyed this game it has very upbeat songs. u are paying $3 for 61 songs as of this review which already is well worth your money. On top of that you can pay $30 for the season pass of this game which is another 220+ songs. I added the plus because this game release 6 more songs every month for you to enjoy if you have the dlc. If you end up liking the game the dlc Is really great value for money spent. the season pass also goes on sale regularly I got mine for $23 usd.

I bought all the dlc's and it was worth it. I got good at the game and it's quite easy to learn. One of the best mobile rhythm games out there👍

game, full, Wronly assumed to buyung a full game but it's understandable since the price was low. I was also under the impression that all the songs are Japanese weeb songs but no, there are Chinese ones, and Mandarin really sounds rough (compared to Japanese) because it's a tonal language. The music is still many times great compared to the wipespread tiktok garbage mumble rap "songs" tho

offset, right, When i got the game to stop crashing all the time i couldn't even play like i want because of the lag and the could not calibrate to the right offset because the way that you calibrate is trash and when you get it right its wrong anyway because off the lag
game, good, Very good game I own this on PC and play it often. unfortunately, it's unplayable on mobile with Bluetooth earbuds. The delay caused the feedback sound to be delayed excessively (>300ms). Which will mess you up. It can be turned off but the satisfying tap tap sounds is half the fun.

phone, new, I really love Muse Dash, enough to buy it on Steam. So, I even bought Just As Planned there on Steam and now, with a new phone, I got mobile version again. Im pretty disappointed that I have to buy Just As Planned AGAIN for mobile, despite my account being linked to the Steam version. I payed that ammount, why must I pay it again? And it wasn't a small amout for my case.

And some character that i have already owned was also reset collecting fragment. Can you please check this problem? thank you. IGN:Maxfact

game, Great, The rhythm game I've been waiting for ages to find. The timing on taps is a bit wonky at times, but that may be a combination of both my phone and my earbuds. Great game, catchy tracks, and cute character designs.

game, good, It's a pretty good rhythm game. Fun, kinda pervy character designs with a ton of charm. My main problem is that the game is just a little lacking in depth. I'm playing songs at Level 6 now and it's starting to feel a bit repetitive. Great for killing time here and there, though.

Already tried searching for solutions on google and reddit, there are many having the same problem but there's no fix for it.

game, fun, I don't even remember how much I paid for this but this is GREAT! I'll test it a bit more before giving 5 stars but so far it seems a pretty fun and catchy game
updates, New, Nice! New updates?
graphics, outstanding, Addicting gameplay, outstanding graphics, and a well running engine. This is the perfect tap to the beat game. I have it on my laptop as well and i am obsessed. Highly recomend. Most songs are Japanese and weird but there are also song with just a beat and even some with english lyrics. You will not regret trying this game.

gamesters, favourite, One of my favourite gamesters 100%. This is my 3rd purchase, I have it on switch & pc. Simple yet hard, beautiful and sweet. A little bit of skin but not too much to be inappropriate for under-age! Totally a time vortex, watch out! :)

game, Great, Great game and the concept of how to play is really unique to other rythm games. It would be better if the developers provide more free songs to play.

asf, lit, lit asf
spot, sweet, Had you asked me if I liked rythmn games a month ago, I would've said no. But Muse Dash hits that sweet spot of easy to pick up and still having a very high skill ceiling. I only really have two complaints: It's a bit straining on your fingers on mobile, and there's definitely problematic characters from a design standpoint. Other than that it's great

game, Nice, Nice game! I really love it
time, same, They have no business making something so cute and so fire at the same time
thing, other, I love this game! I debated on getting it for so long because of the purchase but hey 1.99 isn't THAT bad. Only two things that I have an issue with, is that when I try to open the app up it sometimes crashes and takes me a minute or two to reopen it without it crashing. The other thing is that sometimes it is delayed, I even messed with the settings to see if I had it wrong but it's just a thing that sometimes happens. OVERALL I love it 100%, music, characters, and the rhythm base gaming.
game, good, Ahhq good game play . Ilove it That character's like anime so i like it
game, overall, This game is awesome, graphics are very impressive, overall very good game, its a rhythm based game and im most certai ly good at those types so this game is is perfect, although some characters are pay-to-win.

songs, several, I like this game. I actually have it in nintendo switch first. So when it came to mobile, I was excited. But I noticed something odd about the game in my mobile (Huawei P30). At first I thought it's just one song but it's several songs - the beats and song DON'T sync. It's a few milliseconds too fast. I tried running the offset but it's still the same. Please rectify the port at least.
music, many, Preety fun, I enjoyed it. There are many music that I can choose. But maybe it will be perfect if you give 60fps to make the game more smoothly.
songs, hololive, You should put more hololive songs.... i think
game, Great, Great game very cute art style

game, fun, Overall a pretty fun game, art and graphics are extremely on point. But the lack of storyline(s) and some hypersexualised characters kinda drive me off, so here's a tip, put the age minimum at 15+, as 12 year olds might get a wrong concept about this game, other than that it's pretty good game at around a 7.5/10.

girls, cute, Ah yes, a rhythm game but with cute girls. The ecchi theme and everything, it's splendidly perfect. The graphics, and everything about this game is just wonderful. Even though I couldn't get perfect scores cause' I suck at it, it's still great.

girl, caricatures!especially, It's really nice!I love the music and the caricatures!especially bunny girl.😏
time, sane, Purchased this plus the DLC after getting it on sale on the Switch. Kinda upset I bought the game twice. At the sane time this is the kind of game you might buy twice just so you can play it more often. Wish I could link my progress here with my Switch but that just means I gotta 100 it twice... Which normally would suck but this is a fun game so I don't mind.

songs, popular, very fun and simple to play, just wish there are more popular songs that i know in the game
inerface, laggy, I love this game no bug's just about no laggy inerface apart from some very sexual themes but I don't care about that the game is worth all the money you spend on it.

game, mobile, I've thoroughly enjoyed this game on switch for a while and got the mobile game as well because I enjoy the game so much.
problem, main, Game is fun and the songs are good, but my main problem is that the game is laggy at times, leading to multiple missed notes, ruining your combo. Once this is fixed this would definitely be a 5 star game.

games, best, Amazing!! One of the best rhythm games out there. I highly recommend getting the bundle that includes all current and future song packs as it is very valueable and so worth it. Update: So one year later the game is still awesome, tons of fun, and is still easily my favorite game on play store. I'm still getting all the song packs and characters from the music pack bundle I bought 2 years ago. And I still highly reccomend especially if you're a fan of rhythm games!!

banger, absolute, An absolute banger of a game! If you like rhythm games, cute anime girls, and that bubbly electronic music you will love this game. I've played the Steam port far more, but the mobile version is still a great experience! I would like to see controller support added though, that'd be cool.

while, long, I love this game. I initially got it on Steam a long while back and loved it since. As someone who constantly needs to be doing something with their hands and desires visual stimulation; the game is challenging, addictive, and the graphics/designs are beautiful. The music selection is outstanding and varied. The devs are wonderful and humorous, and it doesn't go unnoticed.

app, Chinese, If you have a Miniso chain of stores in your country, you will realise that the business model is very similar. It is a Chinese app pretending to be a Japanese one marketed to a English speaking target audience. The product is very much like those in Miniso, competively priced, some misses but more hits. At less than $3, it is worth picking up. Hopefully, the developers will add more content in time to come. Edit: After having this game for about 3 years, what I can say is, buy this game!

headset, wireless, Like a goofball, I tried playing this with a wireless headset that has a 700ms latency. Of course the game doesn't support a delay that bonkers, but that's an extreme case anyway. Great game.

game, Best, Best anime-themed rhythm game, even better it can be played offline so i can still play it when im out of internet! Gameplay is pretty much similar to taiko overall, but more innovative, you control over a character that will run and beat enemies following the rhythm. There is in-app purchases, but the default one have plenty lot of musics and free characters. Very worth the price, especially if you love rhythm game, anime-themed game, and looking for a good game playable offline.

time, long, I've been eyeing on this game for a long time! I'm not playing it much, but I'm really amazed by the visuals (I didn't expect this years April fools illustration would be my favorite!) My only problems were the double tap needed to pause midgame and the difficulty to rotate the screen. Other than that, this is amazing. A must try, worth the money!

Songs, free, Game Is Good In my opinion, But as of now ive completed every free (Default) Songs, and with this you are resorted too spending real money in order to have some sort of fun (Mostly All rhythm Games) Sure you Can Go back and do Hard/Master (difficulty) But That is all there is too this game (The Songs) The Game is Small From what Ive Seen from other Rhythm Games, Alot of things could be expanded on, Such as the topic for this Review (Default/Free Songs) its lacking and I want to see more of it!

gripe, only, Highly recommend. I absolutely love the character designs for the muses, the levels are designed amazingly, everything is just so good. The only gripe I have about this game is that you need to buy packs to get more songs but even then it is still worth it. The songs in the base game were more than enough for me to play hours.

dollar, best, I found this Game through the collab with Cytus 2. And i absolutely love it. It's so different yet so similar, it makes you really work on improving your hand eye coordination. I absolutely love the character design, although its a bit...q u e s t i o n a b l e at times. I think this is the best dollar ive spent.

system, sorting, This is a great rhythm game imo. Though I'd like to report a bug with the sorting system, that seems to have changed in the few months since I last played this, in that if I have it set to only show the default music, some songs from other music packs get filtered in anyways.

style, unique, Everything in this game is made perfectly, with it's unique style. Worth to buy and play. Other music packs inside are given fair price and of course, real good. The difficulty of the game is pretty challenging but not too insane so it would be nice for those who just want to enjoy the rhythm. Thank you PeroPeroGames!

music, good, At first for me it is not interesting but when I saw someone playing it live I immediately downloaded it and when I tested it out I was so happy that it is fun. Finally another good music game.
forums, online, The app would not install on my tablet. Support reached out finally. Although their suggestion was unhelpful, I was finally able to get everything working after reading online help forums.
screen, black, Game doesn't work. When I launch the game I only see a black screen. My money is gone for nothing!
u, best, The best game u can ever play!
game, fine, This is just fine game for me. Quite stressful enough, not enjoyable. Note design and timing of the notes are not quite related to the songs. As a "rhythm" game, notes have to be shown before I hit. But I found that several notes come out all of the sudden. You should remember all notes if it's possible. And offest option is quite strange. I cannot understand what it represents exactly. Well, but some of the contents like game designs and songs are pretty neat. So, your choice to play.

music, simplistic, Great simplistic music games that I can really enjoy playing. A huge plus for being able to play it offline. If there is a majore complaint, it is the inability to turn off sfx when playing while having ot enable in the menu screen. This is due to the delay in audio cause by TWS bluetooth headset due to newer phone not having audio jacks.

Generation, 10th, Unable to play on my Chromebook. I have a Samsung Chromebook running Intel i5 Processor (10th Generation). Most of the time, premium games purchased from Google Play Store will work. Was hoping games from the Play Store could be compatible with the processor. Could not give it a 1 star if I can't play it.

reason, big, So, I give it 4 stars for one big reason. I don't know what causes this to happen, perhaps it's because I only have wireless headphones, but the beats are just a tad bit off from the max I can go for the offbeat. I'd change this to 5 stars once it'd be fixed, otherwise a well developed game, addicting for some music lovers, and good songs all around.
