is, game, cool, this, I love this game please play this this is a cool rhythm game and I love it so much!download muse dash pls
is, game, amazing, This, This is an amazing game. Amazing graphics, music, characters, etc. But theres something I have a problem with. When I Uninstalled the app due to problems with launching the app, it reset me back to level 69 (I was level 101 btw). I lost several characters, several songs, several elfins, and several characters chips and illustrations. Mind you, i was uninformed that itd reset some of my progress. Vv disappointed. Other than that, I'd say it's a pretty good game! I'd 100% recommend to my friends!

's, way, nice, It, One of the best rhythm games on mobile, my only problem being that you can't sync Just as Planned from the Steam version. It's a nice way to play the game on the go but I just wish that my purchase carried over.
'm, level, same, I, I have this game on here and on steam and before it would let me sync my progress between the two however the last time I tried to play it on here I synced it as usual and it just put me back on level 1 even though both saves were higher level and I can't sync my progress again I'm still the same level on steam which is logged into the same account but level 1 on here now and there's no way to get my progress back.
's, game, great, it, Very fun tap rhythm game! I love the cute characters and each song seems to have such a impactful rhythm when you play! Only issue is that I can't sync my account with my steam one at the moment but other than that it's a great game!
was, game, fun, it, Game forced me to delete my cloud save. I logged in to my account, and it asked which save I wanted to pick.. no matter what option I picked (cloud save or local save) it kept saying it would select the brand new level 1 account. I force closed the app and it deleted my cloud save. After clearing data and trying to login again, my cloud save is replaced with the level 1 save... Disappointing, it was a fun game up until now.
is, game, great, this, The game is extremely fun if you like Rhythm games. I have 2 complaints though, sometimes when I go to play a song the game crashes or on certain song it will have a annoying static noise. I play on mobile so some of these problems may not occur on other devices. Other than that this is a great game.
is, time, first, This, This is the first time I ever paid my money to buy a game on phone and I do not think that I will ever regret my decision.
's, game, good, it, Not much else to say other than it's a good game.
is, game, good, This, This is a good game my sister is getting good at it üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüëç
is, dollar, best, This, This is the best dollar I have spent.
's, game, great, It, It's just a great rhythm game
is, game, good, this, Can you pls add controller support devs? but still this is a pretty good game, definitely worth buying!
is, game, worth, this, Can you pls add controller support devs? but still this is a pretty good game, definitely worth buying!
is, game, best, This, This is the best rhythm game I have ever played! Good graphics, good music, everything is good. I wish the girls have more dialogues and voices, that would make the game more lively. I also recommend making a " make-your-own-song " feature so that people can make their own song and beatmaps. I also wish that this game have multiplayers and online battles so that we can battle with other players and friends. Very good game, 5 stars. Definitely would recommended to my friends... if I had one :'(
is, game, best, This, This is the best music game at mobile
's, experience, better, it, I really love this game, I play it almost everyday never getting bored. So far great experience I have not experienced lag or other things that I have read in others people review I've had the game for over a year now on my LGk1 worked great I've upgraded to the Samsung galaxy s21 plus and it's a even better experience!!!
is, fun, much, this, Sorry for not saying anything...this is so much fun !!
's, screen, black, it, I can't play cuse it's black screen
's, game, good, it, Basically what it's telling you it's true. Most of the music is fire. Kinda hope they add more characters though. But it's a good game.
's, game, nice, it, Been loving this game, it's a nice game to chill out to while chilling at work, or waiting for stuff to load.
's, experience, beautiful, It, This game is wonderful!! I recommend it to those wanting to try out rhythm games, this one is really addicting, and worth the money. Leveling up can get you characters, little friends that help you, or cool illustrations you can view while the song loads! It's a beautiful experience, there are songs and characters you can purchase, I personally think it's worth it, most importantly, the songs, they're really good and challenging on the difficulties! I totally recommend!
's, game, good, it, it's a good game, i really like it. however, the game tends to like to not register my taps from time to time. i even had times where i couldn't move at all and just had to take damage because i couldn't do anything, i couldn't even pause. it's still a great game don't get me wrong, but i might switch over to the pc version. also I don't know why but it fails every so often with synchronisation to my pc, which is a right kick in the balls when you have allot of progress on phone but not on pc.

ca, game, good, we, I wish we could play with sleepwalker girl normaly but we cant good game tho
's, screen, black, it, i play this on my old phone and i freaking love it but when i try to play on my new phone, it's just black screen.. great game but idk what's going on lol
's, game, nice, It, It's just a very nice game with very good and catchy songs
's, game, pretty, it, it's a very pretty game with a cute artstyle and pretty characters! I downloaded this for the phigros Collab (I am a big fan of phigros lol and this game has a good reputation) and I liked this game a lot so I decided to buy some more packs. sailor suit buro's ability sometimes makes the game lag though for some reason... it can be fixed by lowering the quality but it isn't as pretty. and sometimes loading can take a while.... still a nice game though

is, game, good, this, I'm new to games like this but this is a good game to learn.
been, player, big, I, I've always been a big rhythm game player I play games like beatsaver and tap tap revolution and I enjoyed musse Dash very much. From the Q characters and the bright colors and the wonderful soundtrack I think it's all top-notch

's, glitchy, super, it, I want a refund. I have had this game for 2 days. 2 DAYS. And i want a refund. It was great the first day, amazing, quickly became one of my favorite games. But now it's super glitchy. I did not pay money for a game that crashes constantly and has audio that clitches and buzzes so bad it trigers my fight ir flight response and gives me a horrible headache. I esentually baught a game that was only playable for a day. SOMEONE GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!
's, game, great, It, It's a great game! Just a little laggy at times.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game, but I lost 50 lvls when I updated it, I was at lvl 110+ then dropped down to lvl 67, whyyyyyy, was bout to get bunny girl rin too..........
's, game, fun, It, It's a really fun game to pass time just kind of hard sometimes a glitch glitches but it's fun
's, game, good, It, It's good game haven't played much of it but the only issue I have is the song limitations it would be better if it had custom songs or if the game had a way of you getting songs without paying
been, screen, black, it, When I got a new phone it ran perfectly but if I had my old phone it probably would've still been a black screen after the loading. Overall I love this game and I hope no serious mess ups happen this time.
is, idea, fantastic, which, A very good rhythm game especially the art on this one which is totally cute. On the other parts like the DLC which is a fantastic idea paying Just as Planned will make you unlock all songs and later dlc coming for free which is fantastic........ (Truly a masterpiece)
was, screen, black, all, Sorry to leave a review like this. I have been eyeing this game for a while now and decided to give it a shot, but when I opened the game all I got was a black screen? I'm not able to play something that I paid for :/
's, game, great, it, This game is amazing there is only one thing that I wish I could add and that's to add songs and chart them are selfs like something kinda like GD but other than my crazy idea this game is amazing and challenging it's a great rhythm game for people who have never played a rhythm game to easily get into rhythm games and I love all the songs and it sold me when I saw that mope mope was a level so congrats because I'm keeping this game for a long time
's, label, unbeatable, it, Like the game but it's basically just unbeatable [white label] but worse and not free try that game on pc first if given the opportunity

's, game, good, it, App not installing. It used to work on my other phone but now, when you open it, there is only a black screen. I've checked the obb folder and there is nothing in it. Other than that, it's a very good game. You'll definitely get your money's worth.
is, game, great, this, Wow, I LIKE THIS GAMES. well, in my opinion, this is great game. It's side Scrollers combine with rhythm games, it's worth it man, i play this game with each difficult. I play hard, but most people is hardest game ever, hell, even on master mode is hard than i thought on other games. Man, it's a best games ever!!

's, language, tonal, it, Wronly assumed to buyung a full game but it's understandable since the price was low. I was also under the impression that all the songs are Japanese weeb songs but no, there are Chinese ones, and Mandarin really sounds rough (compared to Japanese) because it's a tonal language. The music is still many times great compared to the wipespread tiktok garbage mumble rap "songs" tho
is, game, great, this, Best Rhythm Game for Mobile, Especially with the well designed stages, characters, elfins. Overall this is a great game, I'll support this even more!
was, amout, small, it, I really love Muse Dash, enough to buy it on Steam. So, I even bought Just As Planned there on Steam and now, with a new phone, I got mobile version again. Im pretty disappointed that I have to buy Just As Planned AGAIN for mobile, despite my account being linked to the Steam version. I payed that ammount, why must I pay it again? And it wasn't a small amout for my case.
's, love, great, It, It's great love the best rhythm gaem I've ever played would recommend if I can
's, gaem, best, It, It's great love the best rhythm gaem I've ever played would recommend if I can
's, game, good, It, It's a pretty good rhythm game. Fun, kinda pervy character designs with a ton of charm. My main problem is that the game is just a little lacking in depth. I'm playing songs at Level 6 now and it's starting to feel a bit repetitive. Great for killing time here and there, though.
is, UwU, amazing, it, (ÔΩ°ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•ÔΩ°)Ôæâ‚ù§Ô∏è Buy it is amazing UwU
is, tap, perfect, This, Addicting gameplay, outstanding graphics, and a well running engine. This is the perfect tap to the beat game. I have it on my laptop as well and i am obsessed. Highly recomend. Most songs are Japanese and weird but there are also song with just a beat and even some with english lyrics. You will not regret trying this game.
is, purchase, 3rd, This, One of my favourite gamesters 100%. This is my 3rd purchase, I have it on switch & pc. Simple yet hard, beautiful and sweet. A little bit of skin but not too much to be inappropriate for under-age! Totally a time vortex, watch out! :)
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but the hits are way to early. Fix this or your off the data of my phone (!__!)
's, songs, several, it, I like this game. I actually have it in nintendo switch first. So when it came to mobile, I was excited. But I noticed something odd about the game in my mobile (Huawei P30). At first I thought it's just one song but it's several songs - the beats and song DON'T sync. It's a few milliseconds too fast. I tried running the offset but it's still the same. Please rectify the port at least.
's, game, good, it, Overall a pretty fun game, art and graphics are extremely on point. But the lack of storyline(s) and some hypersexualised characters kinda drive me off, so here's a tip, put the age minimum at 15+, as 12 year olds might get a wrong concept about this game, other than that it's pretty good game at around a 7.5/10.
's, game, lovely, It, It's a very lovely game, I've been enjoying it and getting better and better at it
's, game, easy, It, It's not an easy game but that's what I like about this. Didn't regret every peso to buy this game. Hope you still continue to update. More power!
is, game, fun, this, Purchased this plus the DLC after getting it on sale on the Switch. Kinda upset I bought the game twice. At the sane time this is the kind of game you might buy twice just so you can play it more often. Wish I could link my progress here with my Switch but that just means I gotta 100 it twice... Which normally would suck but this is a fun game so I don't mind.
is, app, Chinese, It, If you have a Miniso chain of stores in your country, you will realise that the business model is very similar. It is a Chinese app pretending to be a Japanese one marketed to a English speaking target audience. The product is very much like those in Miniso, competively priced, some misses but more hits. At less than $3, it is worth picking up. Hopefully, the developers will add more content in time to come. Edit: After having this game for about 3 years, what I can say is, buy this game!
's, case, extreme, that, Like a goofball, I tried playing this with a wireless headset that has a 700ms latency. Of course the game doesn't support a delay that bonkers, but that's an extreme case anyway. Great game.
's, reason, only, that, Anime, that's the only reason.
is, lmao, unpopular, that, Didn't really have a good experience with it on Mobile so I'll just stick with it in PC instead. Giving three stars is fair to me and that is basically an unpopular opinion lmao
is, dollar, best, this, I found this Game through the collab with Cytus 2. And i absolutely love it. It's so different yet so similar, it makes you really work on improving your hand eye coordination. I absolutely love the character design, although its a bit...q u e s t i o n a b l e at times. I think this is the best dollar ive spent.
was, time, first, This, I got fooled by their April Fools joke. Those damn devs really know how to strike me down. This was the first time I ever fell for an April Fools joke. I now hate the devs and myself.
is, imo, great, This, This is a great rhythm game imo. Though I'd like to report a bug with the sorting system, that seems to have changed in the few months since I last played this, in that if I have it set to only show the default music, some songs from other music packs get filtered in anyways.
is, game, best, this, amazing game would definitely recommend if you are a rhythm game player actually this is the best rhythm game in my opinion
's, style, unique, it, Everything in this game is made perfectly, with it's unique style. Worth to buy and play. Other music packs inside are given fair price and of course, real good. The difficulty of the game is pretty challenging but not too insane so it would be nice for those who just want to enjoy the rhythm. Thank you PeroPeroGames!
is, game, fine, This, This is just fine game for me. Quite stressful enough, not enjoyable. Note design and timing of the notes are not quite related to the songs. As a "rhythm" game, notes have to be shown before I hit. But I found that several notes come out all of the sudden. You should remember all notes if it's possible. And offest option is quite strange. I cannot understand what it represents exactly. Well, but some of the contents like game designs and songs are pretty neat. So, your choice to play.
Is, Game, Good, This, This Is a Good Game... But.. Can You Fix the Black Screen Bug???
is, game, fun, This, This is such a fun rhythm game
is, screen, black, All, All i got is a black screen i rate 2 stars cuz i got my monney back tnx for that / lol fix the bug !!
's, game, overall, It, It's an overall chill game. You can just play casually or try to get perfect. Great songs and visuals.
's, game, amazing, it, Overall it's a amazing game,I play it everyday ,also it's fun and the animations are amazing so are the songs
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game, usually play it to kill time.
are, note, useful, they, I have so much fun playing this game, but one problem is the elfins, rabot-233 can't hit mashers and hold note, they are a useful note because it will not interrupt the combo, but if you're not catch ghost and blue note you will not lose your combo, only if i hit them two only get a point, please fix the elfins
is, option, atleast, It, It is 2021 many phones have high framrate now, please have atleast 120fps option.
is, game, bad, This, This is a bad game you can't even pick the music you want you can't even import it
