version, original, I have been waiting for FOREVER for this to be on mobile! Just like the original PC version. Not 5* because the UI is a little wonky and there are some relics that aren't working correctly.

state, current, I own this game on steam as well and it is great but the port is very mediocre. There are tons of issues with the user interface. It makes it very awkward to play and you are constantly making moves or choices you don't intend to. With hope they eventually fix it but as far as I'm concerned it on is a waste of $10 in it's current state
game, Great, Great game, always a challenge
nuace, more, A deck building roguelike that has more nuace than you'd expect looking at it from the outside. And as you play it unlocks more content, so it keeps you playing

mechanics, Phenomenal, A must-play! Phenomenal game mechanics and replayability. The game is really good at giving you a chance of feeling very powerful but still punishes your choices on certain fights. When you finally unlock the end-game you'll realise you weren't prepared at all for what it brings. Time to rethink your deck building strategies!

name, save, Start up crash involving Google Play, or Google Games, or whatever it is. Prompted to choose a Google account to play with twice, save slot buttons barely respond, and when they do I'm prompted to pick a Google account again, and then it crashes before the keyboard can come up to type in a save slot name. No idea what to do about this, enjoyed STS on console but thoroughly disappointed at the moment, as I can't even begin to play it here. Also no dev response that I can see? What the hell?

screen, syncing, I love the game, but I am often stuck for minutes on the "syncing" screen. Considering the fact that I only ever play on one device and don't need this feature, I am rather frustrated 😒 It would be nice if this feature could be either disabled, made to work in the background or simply run faster..

game, based, Wonderful turn based strategy rogue-like (yes it's a luck based thinking game). Great mobile release. Worth the price, replayability is high. There are at least over a dozen knockoffs of this game out there, but this is the one that started it all. None of the knockoff games capture quite the same balance in the cards and relics interactions. Would recommend!

game, good, Extremely good game, but I would not recommend playing it on this platform. The load times are the worst of any phone game I've played.
game, amazing, amazing game
character, green, Love the game but the game crash everytime I reach the heart with the green character. Please get this sorted
port, enjoyable, Very enjoyable port, but card unlocks are bugged. I've gone far past the point all cards should be unlocked and 3 cards for each character are stilled locked. Please fix this bug.
idiot, absolute, Whoever decided to make this require an internet connection and constantly sync data is an absolute idiot. There's nothing else to say. I love the pc game but this is just stupid.
Crashes, amazing, Crashes and loses progress :( otherwise amazing

gripe, Big, The game seems to be a port from PC/Console. Yhe issue I seem to always have is that the game says Syncing and saves but when I go to load the save another time/day, the data seems to be erased. Big gripe as I have been seriously far into runs and save and quit to continue at a later time to later try and continue to have to start from scratch again. Definitely a dev issue but I don't expext a fix anytime soon. Way better on the PC/Console platforms.

game, Great, Great game, but very difficult
difficulty, reasonable, It is pretty engaging. With reasonable difficulty ramp up.
issue, only, The port to mobile is almost perfect. The only issue I have seen (and as some other people pointed out) is that it is a little easy to select the wrong card to play. But this issue isn't a big deal if you are aware and careful. Slay the Spire is a great game and one that I have played for dozens of hours across a number of platforms. I would definitely recommend it.

card, Bad, Bad card selection, and when you try to cancel it may play the card anyway. Don't buy it's a trap compared to the pc
finger, fat, Very disappointed in the port... This game is unforgiving yet the cards are sticky, play when not meant to be played. The events have no confirmations. You fat finger something once or get unlucky with a sticky card and boom, your entire run is ruined. I'm not sure why you haven't fixed this yet. I've waited a year to buy this thinking you would have had the time since then. 0/5 do not buy the phone version you will be frustrated. What a shame for one of my favorite games of all time.

experience, same, Syncing is insanly slow. Not the same experience as iPad or PC. Same on wifi and mobile.
lot, replayable, I wish I could give about 3.7 stars, but I'm rounding up. On PC, this game is an easy 4.8 though! If you're not gelling with the mechanics on tablet, try downloading it on PC and see if you like it better there. Highly replayable, lot of fun play options, deckbuilding without stress. However, the Syncing issue is a SERIOUS drag and took an entire star off my review. Additionally, the card manipulation took me a little while to get used to - though it's not insurmountable by any means.

port, great, It's a great port, however, I currently have an issue where the game force closes every time upon reaching the "Victory?" screen. I still see it for a second, then the game force closes. This happened twice now, and when I go back to check if the run was saved, it wasn't. This means that I can't win. Please resolve this. Thanks!
games, favorite, One of my favorite games of all time, and an excellent android port. I play like 300 hours on the PC. Honestly I prefer the touchscreen controls.

game, original, The original game is great, but this is a sloppy port. Card selection is sticky, so it's easy to select a card you didn't intend, and all the dialogs are clearly designed with a mouse in mind

gestures, new, Hoping for an update to support the new Android back and home gestures better. Currently own the game on steam, Xbox and now android. The game is top notch worth the buy many times over. Mobile version with touch control and smaller screen makes for a mild annoyance but not enough to take from the game overall. The only thing I'm not sure about is the daily leaderboard doesn't seem to show my name when I look for it. Overall I'm glad it came to mobile so that I can play anywhere I am.

game, Best, Best game on Android, Until Dream Quest gets a port.
reason, Only, Game is amazing as it is on PC. Only reason I haven't given it a 5 star is because I've maxed out The Silent and completed/won a run and I still have 3 cards locked for her. Everywhere I've looked says it's a bug and I have had no success trying to resolve it.

game, Great, Great card game with lots of replay value. Loved it on the PC and was glad to see it on mobile.
game, based, Slay the Spire is a turn based card game. I enjoy that it gives you a challenge. There's a lot of variety which gives it replay value. I would describe the game as a rogue like where each run is unique. This game falls short on some gameplay mechanics; enemies continuously get stronger after each turn while you get weaker which just ends up feeling frustrating and unfair rather than fun, making it overall an unsatisfying game to play. Controls are also finicky. Hard "maybe" for recommendation.
game, Amazing, Amazing strategy game with rng fun
game, great, Tried playing the game, but it just doesn't work on the Chromebook. Try creating a file, place the name, and the game just stops. It's a great game that I've played on PC platforms, but I guess the game isn't compatible for Chromebooks at this time. What a shame.
left, silent, It's fun. I am on ascension 10 with the silent, and am still missing 3 cards, all of which are locked. Says there's no unlocks for the silent left. Really disappointing, one of the cards is a catalyst, which triples enemy poison. I feel like that would be such a nice card to pick up but I guess I will never know until this bug is fixed.

misplays, constant, Card deselection with touchscreen doesn't work and causes constant misplays. Hopefully the refund will go through. Will buy again if it gets fixed.
game, Awesome, Awesome tactic card game that is insanely replayable!
version, mobile, I love this game so much but the mobile version has a few infuriating glitches. Mainly it constantly deletes progress. I've beat the game like 7 times and it never saves my unlocks. Crazy frustrating. Gonna have to stick to the PC version.

issue, Main, Love that this is on mobile now. Main issue is, it loses my game on boss fights. I play this at work and sometimes get called away, losing my progress. Also a lock in feature for card selection, like pick one of 20 cards would be nice. I have accidently clicked a wrong card just scrolling several times. Others wise great game.

amount, decent, The UI for the card selection is so bad that it makes it almost unplayable. Especially if you have a decent amount of cards in hand. It really needs to be reworked.
fun, much, It's so much fun that I had to uninstal it before my wife divorces me.
game, full, Amazing , text could be a bit larger but it's the full game
irksome, little, I love this game, before it came out on mobile I'd played 100+ hours on pc/switch. The game itself is fully intact and literally got me into deckbuilders. One or two things are a little irksome for me - firstly, I have the bgm muted and the sfx low as I play on my commute while listening to a podcast, however I have to wait for the game to sync before the music actually goes down to 0 so every time I open the game I need to wait and pause my podcast. Second, it get a bit freezy when you win/die
game, best, The best deck building game I've ever played on mobile, and on PC, love to support humble bundle.

fun, great, The game is great fun. The android port is unstable with crashes and losing data. If you play through an entire run it will likely be fine. If you do a run and try to come back to it the run will likely be deleted. Unfortunate for such a great game.

review, full, I LOVE this game, but I cannot give it a full 5 star review. There are so many issues with loading and data syncing that are immensely frustrating. I'm super happy that there is a mobile version, but man it's so annoying to deal with these issues. I just want the game to turn on and work every time. And it just doesn't. Please fix these sync and loading issues and I'd gladly give a full 5 star review

builders, best, Definitely buy this one a 5 star game and one of the best deck builders of all time with a nice rogue-lite elements. 4 star rating as it crashes everytime the phone goes into battery saver.

sync, online, The card selection and online sync is wonky at times, but apart from that it's a faithful port. Mod support would be awesome.

replayability, endless, I've got 300 hours on Android and 2000 hours on steam. This game has endless replayability. The android version chugs a little when syncing saves at the start, and also when you die (moreso in long runs). Not game breaking by any means, just a little annoying.

game, Great, Great game but the controls could be a lot better. You'd think it'd control well with all touch controls but it really doesn't in this port

issues, slight, There are some slight issues with card selection when you have a massive hand, but I imagine it's less problematic if playing on a tablet due to more screen size. Overall, I'd say it's a really good port, my biggest issue is properly selecting things on the top bar, but that could be due to my fat fingers. Pro tip, if you're trying to deselect a card, drag it down to one of the bottom corners of the screen, this will take the "cursor" off of the cards and nothing will be selected.

complaint, only, Love this game. I was so exited for it to finally come to mobile. So I bought it again to have on my cpu and my devices. My only complaint is that I often use it while listening to something else and no matter my settings that initial synch always has sound on, rather than being muted. And it takes a good 30 seconds to synch. Other than that, I love this game and the in game controls are great, nothing else negative!

game, Great, Great game but the data syncing is terrible. Why does it take so long to sync data each time it loads?
purchase, third, This is my third purchase of STS, so I knew what I was getting in to. Game is great, and touch controls work fine, but (on my phone at least) there are a few fiddly bits, like selecting a potion or trying to view your deck from the small icon at the top of the screen

thing, wrong, I have hundreds of hours in this on steam, got it on the phone so I could play on the go or with one hand only. The app seems incapable of saving an in-progress run between sessions, and the interactions around card selection are painful. Lots of playing the wrong thing, or choosing the wrong card to upgrade when trying to scroll. For such a successful game, you would have thought they'd be able to put more love into the mobile port.

port, bad, So off the bat it's not a bad port the core game is there a tad expensive for a phone ap, custom options are a little gutted the problems with the game are. -Game doesn't always save your run -You can press continue only so many times(3-4max) before it deletes your save Selecting cards us very annoying as it will legit close the game on new devices since it's low your phone will think you did a swipe to close. -the game randomly kicks you out of the run sometimes and doesn't save your progress

review, Original, EDIT Oct 2021: Devs haven't fixed the game bugs yet. No game update since MARCH. The lack of support for a game this good is heartbreaking. Original review: Super fun, looks great, really addictive. A few initial release bugs: tapping cards to see info/effects during combat is super finicky, sometimes the card description gets cut off the screen. Tapping through them to select/deselect isn't very smooth at all. Nothing a software patch won't iron out! No complaints otherwise, love this game.

games, better, Way better games out there. Don't waste your money.
game, Super, Super fun game, but unplayably buggy. If you hold a card to view what it does, them click away it just plays the card anyway.
time, syncing, Seriously need to do something bout the syncing time when the app starts and also my game stutters when i die in game. The whole game just stops there and need about 5 to 10second to come back before i can continue to main screen. ( Redmi Note 10 pro )

pile, draw, Game is still fantastic, even on mobile. But the data sync slowness and some UI being awful like it's impossible for me to check my draw pile because my camera punch hole is there, I keep opening the window tab trying to pull a card, there's no option to stop this from happening and it's very easy to accidentally use a card as you cannot unselect. But it sort of makes up for this by making it so tapping and holding certain options and cards will give you details on what the cards and options do

Sometimes tapping on a different card will even cause the currently selected card to cast itself. Game is a solid 6/5, UI/UX in battle 2/5...

game, Awesome, Awesome game! I've got almost 100 hours on PC and mobile, sand I definitely recommend you picking this gem up. It's a great single player PvE card based Roguelike, with tons of content. Every character can be played in lots of ways, which makes the experience even better. All this port could use is a bit more polish. Notably, in the Lagavulin fight, the health bar glitches out and gets too wide. But besides some graphical stuff, and occasional crashing, this is a solid game, I recommend it!

app, Awful, Awful app. Love the game, but this apps sync feature wastes time and constantly loses my run saves. DEVS, PLEASE REMOVE SYNC FEATURE!
control, terrible, Absolutely terrible port control wise. Continually screwed over because selecting a card to see it better usually ends up accidentally playing it.
others, many, As many others have said, great game, poor Android app. I was willing to overlook the card selection problems, load times, and battery usage, but one I haven't seen mentioned - I just completed a run at A:16 and died to the Heart, which should still allow me to move to A:17. But it didn't. I've had the same problem before, but it took me about 8 unsuccessful runs to get through A:16 and having the rug pulled out from under me is, to put it lightly, unappreciated. Play it on PC.

problem, same, As many others have said, great game, poor Android app. I was willing to overlook the card selection problems, load times, and battery usage, but one I haven't seen mentioned - I just completed a run at A:16 and died to the Heart, which should still allow me to move to A:17. But it didn't. I've had the same problem before, but it took me about 8 unsuccessful runs to get through A:16 and having the rug pulled out from under me is, to put it lightly, unappreciated.

farce, regular, Apart from the regular farce of trying to deselect a card it's great.
port, Terrible, Terrible mobile port, buttons are unresponsive, if you have a screen that wraps around the edges of your phone you won't know what the top bar says or does. Dungeon Tales and Rogue Adventure are the same concept but don't cost $10 and you can actually get smooth gameplay because they were actually made for mobile.

menu, drop, I love this game on PS4, easily have 200 hours in it, but I had to request a refund on the play store. The UI is not suitable for mobile, I can't even select relics or potions without misclicking or opening the drop-down menu on my phone instead.
games, favorite, One of my favorite games of all time. Can easily play it for hundreds or thousands of hours. Can feel unfairly difficult, but it's just a very long learning process.

systems, other, Plays fantastically on mobile, honestly better than on other systems. I have seen the game stutter on Nintendo switch, but not on my old Samsung G6. This deck builder is the bees knees!
janky, little, I mean the controls are a little janky, but nothing that bothersome. Same great game and good experience on Android.

building, Excellent, Excellent deck building roguelite, I've not had issue with the controls like some people have.
cards, cool, very cool cards and gameplay
issue, Only, Love it like the PC version. Only issue is that whenever I go to smack the heart it freezes then kicks me from the game. When I relog the character run has disappeared (not even in the run log). Once that issue gets fixed I'll change the review
game, good, Pros Its a good game Cons Successful start-up~50% of the time Constantly asks you to pair with a mobile profile Sometimes clicking cards and letting go will keep that card 'held' so you have to slowly click out of the 'held' card to choose another card The card is displayed too small and is hard to select Unlike on PC, you cant see card upgrades through rightclick Overall the cons ruin the game experience. The controls/UI were not designed for mobile and the experience suffers as a result.

games, best, One of the best deck building games out there. So good I got it for my phone and PC. The UI isn't the best on mobile but it's still very fun.

issues, other, The game is pretty fun and worth 10$, but the user interface is nowhere as good as Hearthstone's. Picking the card is such a hassle because you have to deselect the card each time you let go. A lot of other indie game company issues as well. Saving is a big issue. When you press "Save and Exit", it doesn't freakin save. It just tells you it auto-saves and exits. It doesn't always auto-save each action you do. Also, I lost a few runs because I quit for a break and came back to a lost run.

game, Excellent, Excellent game, but the android implementation is garbage. The seed system does not work (it gives the incorrect seed code to your runs), the UI is very faulty, it's a battery drainer, and it takes forever to load. The actual game is fantastic and I would recommend playing it on PC via Steam.

issues, big, 2 big issues I have with this otherwise great game. 1.) The inability to look at the upgrades of cards unless they are in your deck. It's in the pc version and definitely needs to be here. 2.) Stop making the game remember what card I touched last. The amount of times I try to put a card back in my hand instead of playing it only for the game to decide that I have to play it anyway is infuriating and honestly kinda game breaking (cant safely check actual dmg). Plz fix these and itll be perfect.

syncing, constant, For a pay app, they put nothing into optimizing for android. Very difficult UI, constant syncing causes high data usage, way too high on battery usage. For Daily Climbs, it never shows my scores like mobile users don't count at all. It will not link to steam account so be prepared to start all over. I'm sad i paid for this on mobile. PC is 5 stars, mobile is 2 stars. Very dissapointed with the developers.

shame, complete, Awful UI and UX on Android. This is a complete shame as I love Slay the Spire on Xbox and PC and wanted to really enjoy it here. Unfortunately UI just killed it for me.
card, wrong, Not worth it on Android. The game is full of bugs. Sometimes you finish the run and the game doesn't save. At the beginning of the game if you have internet the game gets stuck syncing forever. Sometimes you select a card and the game makes it very hard to deselect and you end up playing the wrong card. Very bad experience for the price

price, tall, After sinking 50+ hours into this masterpiece of a rogue-lite CCG, the one that 'started it all', I can honestly say this is well worth the tall asking price. The music just accentuates the gloomy atmosphere with a whimsical fantasy vibe, that ties in with the dream theme throughout. Easy enough to pick up, but difficult to master the many, many synergies between cards and relics. Just picked up the beta art for cards, easily my favourite time spent on the game by the developers. 5/5. Perfect.

run, entire, Sync problems make you lose your entire run and happens all the time. I don't care about the garbage UI because the game is turn based, I can deal with it, but after the sync issues started the game became unplayable. Don't buy.

game, favorite, My favorite Android game. I've played 100's at this point and this is the one. Highly recommend. Deep character strategy and daily climbs provide 100+hrs of entertainment. Great Game. 1 note to the devs: recently I've noticed that the unlocks aren't syncing right. I've had to re-install a number of times and I can't unlock the full deck. At the end of a run I don't see any progress towards the character unlocks, but then I look in the compendium and I see I have more unlocks for that character.

time, Fifth, Fifth time uninstalling and reinstalling to save my run. Hoping it works again. Why why why is this a game that needs to be connected to the internet. It's like you are encouraging us to pirate the game so that it works correctly. I love the game so much, but the Android port is hot garbage. *update* didn't work this time. Thanks a lot for getting me so invested in and enjoying your game then ruining it. I even had convinced other people to buy it. This port is complete trash. Stay away.

sessions, quick, Awesome card game with tons of replay value! If you've been on the fence, you won't regret the purchase! It's a game you can pick up and put down easily (quick toilet sessions on work breaks ^^), but you can also spend an hour or more as well (without even noticing).
cards, Deselecting, Unplayable and riddled with bugs. Deselecting cards is finnicky and deck button cannot be pressed to see what cards are remaining in the deck due to front camera cutout. App needs more polish.

port, solid, It's a pretty solid port. Everything's there: the music, the graphics, the insane card combos, it's great. I only have two problems. 1) choosing what card to play and who I want to target is surprisingly tricky. By no means impossible, but it can be annoying at times. 2) every time you die (and you die a lot, it is a roguelike), the game freezes for upwards of 30 seconds.
run, current, There is currently a bug in the game where your current run can be lost after choosing save&quit and closing the app (or even simply changing apps).
game, fantastic, Slay the Spire is a fantastic game, and this is generally a great port. The only major issue I have is that on winning or losing a run, the app freezes for a while, presumably because it's submitting the run to cloud servers. It'd be nice to either have a way to turn cloud saves off, or to submit the runs asynchronously without blocking the main game. Still a very (re)playable and enjoyable game, will update review if that issue gets fixed.

reason, whole, The game is great, but the whole reason I got the mobile app was because I wanted to be able to pick it up and play as I go. Everytime I play a game though, if I want to save and leave that run where it is, next time I play the game won't have saved correctly, and my run is gone. No record of it. Sometimes it even puts me back midway through previous run that day that I already finished. The saving just doesn't work.

bugs, frustrating, This is a 5 star game, but with some frustrating bugs. I've been playing for two months and I've just realised that some cards stay locked and do not appear ingame even though I've fully leveled up all the characters. This does not happen in the PC version. Hoping for an update in the future that will fix this issue as some of the locked cards are extremely important in higher ascensions.

game, Great, Great (addicting) game and contains all features of the full game for about half the price on android. Hundreds of hours of fun, never the same twice. Some small issues with server syncing, it's not always fast which causes hang ups in your play experience sometimes. Small potatoes for such a great game.

runs, many, This version of the app is a disaster. Honestly, I've lost so many good runs due to the terrible UI. Many other people have already mentioned the flaws, so I'll not bother listing them all here. I would expect for the price of this game there would have been some actual work put into making a good android version, but it's clear it's just been directly ported over from the PC version with nothing done to make it a true mobile app. Very disappointing. If you're going to bother spending the money, I'd pick up the PC version. You'll save yourself a lot frustration when it again chooses the wrong card for you. The game is 5 stars, the app is 2 I'm afraid.

pagos, micro, El mejor juego de cartas. Punto. El más equilibrado de todos los que hay. Lo mejor, que no es pay to win, que no hay pase de batalla, que no hay micro pagos. Esa no es la filosofía y se agradece. Lo peor, que "sólo" hay 4 personajes y una vez te los acabas con los 4, no hay mucho más que repeticiónes más difíciles. Le falta algo más (personajes nuevos, zonas temáticas para ascender, enemigos nuevos y quizá mecánicas de varios personajes)

game, good, pretty good game except for the jaw wurm. I cannot for the life of me understand how the devs put out patch after patch without nerfing this ridiculous enemy. you might as well put the final boss of the game on the first floor. runs are won and lost based entirely on enemy rng. butr otehr thanf that, quite good, love the graphics.

game, Great, So far haven't had any sync or save file issues as others have stated. Game runs perfectly fine. Never tried the game on Steam but I can see how this game is so popular. Great game.
experience, good, Card descriptions are cut off on Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. I love this game on the switch, but it's not a good experience for me on mobile
game, Favorite, Favorite game turned Early Access. I've played over 400 hrs on the computer. I love it and the game literally brought roguelite card builders onto the front page. However, this port to my phone feels like an early access game. The buttons are too small and the touchscreen/hit boxes seem really off. The worst, however, is the game's random non-saving. Not only does it NOT SAVE AT EVERY STAGE like regular Slay, it frequently doesnt save anything at all.

game, best, Literally the best game I've ever played, and I've played hundreds of games for over 40 years. The android version has a few minor annoyances (for me, the problems saving daily runs), but having a mobile version is incredible. I bought it for my switch but there the small screen was too painful, on my tablet its fabulous.

garbage, absolute, The game is great on Steam, but the memory management in this version is absolute garbage. It will just forget that you were in the middle of a run. And despite it syncing data all the time, you lose all progress if you uninstall and reinstall. Games have had this figured out for years. Not sure why a super successful game can't get it right.

syncing, slow, It's great to have slay the spire on mobile. That being said, the incredibly slow syncing and the tendency of this version to lose save files can make this a frustrating experience. Not sure why they did the saving the way they did but it is clearly a mistake Also i ran into a horrible bug that makes the game refuse to start up. Apparently this has been unaddressed since july

game, Great, Great game, but giving it 3 stars because seeds behave differently from desktop and are more limited.
minutes, several, This game itself is amazing, but as others have said, the port to android is terrible. The game routinely lags for several minutes(!) on syncing, and occasionally the save corrupts and wipes a run, or reverts to an earlier point in the run. Also, the UI often freezes/lags when selecting cards until you tab away and come back.

game, great, great game, but only an okay port. the problems I have are annoyances, but they add up to take one star off an otherwise 5 star game. if you turn the music off in the settings it will still be playing music while it syncs with the cloud, the text is very small in some places, the touch screen controls are awkward when you have many cards in your hand, you frequently lose small amounts of progress, and there is no way to disable fullscreen or display the real-world time while playing.

port, Terrible, Terrible port of a good game. Spends forever "syncing data" every time you start the game and then when you reinstall it there's nothing saved. Garbage and not worth buying, like 99% of all mobile apps that get abandoned with major issues.

menu, main, I enjoy this game on my pc a lot, but the app is very buggy for me. I often have to restart the app on start up because it freezes or crashes before getting to the main menu. Card controls are a bit finicky and some actions freeze up for a few seconds like ending a run or killing a boss. Using a Note S9.

illness, other, As everyone else stated, the UI is awful. It doesn't event take into account displays which might have on-screen notchs, make some items unclickable (I can't even see what on my draw pile???). Worse, there's no way to rotate the screen to make them clickable in any way. The other annoying, chronic illness is the boot up time. I know other users are having trouble with endless and continuous "syncing data" message throughout the game, but mine only appears on boot up. It takes the game more than a whole minute to load, what the heck? Devs, if you can contact me I'd love to work alongside you to help you fix these issues. Sadly, and since no more updates have been issues since APRIL, it looks like they sent the thing into the store and decided not to spend a any more time on its development.

It doesn't event take into account displays which might have on-screen notchs, make some items unclickable (I can't even see what on my draw pile???). Worse, there's no way to rotate the screen to make them clickable in any way. The other annoying, chronic illness is the boot up time. I know other users are having trouble with endless and continuous "syncing data" message throughout the game, but mine only appears on boot up. It takes the game more than a whole minute to load, what the heck? Devs, if you can contact me I'd love to work alongside you to help you fix these issues.

time, long, Well I've played the game for a long time on ps4 I love it, good game, however it crashes constantly when you die or try to load up the game im on a new phone too. I really hope yall can fix the crashes. EDIT: thanks for fixing the crashes runs beautifully

game, Great, Great game, but need to fix a bug that will not allow any user action once opening the app. The phone recognizes that the app is frozen, but when trying to send feedback the game kicks back on and the feedback screen is lost. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, which did not fix the issue. The game is unplayable in this state.

phone, Blu, I really want to give this 5 stars, but I can't even open the game without it crashing. I've submitted bug reports, asked on reddit, tried clearing storage, deleting and redownloading...nothing works. Blu phone running Android. If I can get this fixed the game is fantastic, definitely worth buying on console or PC.
app, great, 1 star just so I can raise a bug (otherwise great app), my ascension levels keep not working. I've got 5th ascension like 4 times on ironclad and it doesn't allow me to progress past 4th.

ooze, primordial, Slay the Spire is a card collection, rogue like, dungeon crawler where you face monsters, bandits, primordial ooze and giant concrete heads to the death. With cards. It looks great on mobile. Interesting enemy designs throughout, attack animations better that Pokemon. Also, it's fun as hell. Once you get the itch you will be buying this on every platform you own.

option, perfect, i adore slay the spire, and having it available on mobile seems like the perfect option! unfortunately however, it's still kind of buggy and glitchy, and the resolution of the screen has been squished vertically. i also cant flip the direction the game is (it faces left as opposed to right) on my phone, which isn't really something i've encountered before in other games. i'm being generous with stars because i love this game and it has good port potential. please fix the bugs + issues though.

game, Great, Great game until it force stops the day after its installed
issue, syncing, The syncing issue at the start is a major issue. Other than that, the game is great and just like StS on PC.

settings, saved, Was working good until recently and now it just gets hung up everytime I lose, or load the game. The game also doesn't load settings until after it fully loaded, so it's loud as hell until it loads then it goes quiet to your saved settings
game, fantastic, StS is truly a fantastic game! I've played hundreds of hours on PC, and I was willing to put up with some of the minor bugs on mobile but after some syncing issues the game won't load to even the start screen at all anymore, it just crashes as soon as I try to open the app making it impossible to play at all now.

lite, Great, Great deck building rouge lite. Have over 100 hours and all been entertaining. Card drags have to be payed attention to, but if you're not careless you hardly notice it. Did have one game sync issue had to replay one game. Been a blast to play
roguelikes, best, one of the best roguelikes of all time, has some syncing issues but ultimately doesn't bother me much, 100% recommend, though you should definitely play a different version if you can.

star, worthy, I keep losing runs due to a sync issue when the game was in the background. This game absolutely slaps but the sync issue is a big sad. Easily 5 star worthy if this issue is fixed.
game, Best, Best card game ever! 7 hours in and no lost runs or crashes. You gotta play on a tablet to get the best experience. And as far as playing the wrong cards goes, I have yet to do it. People also complain about start up syncing, it takes 5 seconds lmfao. Don't listen to the negative reviews!!

game, incredible, Slay the spire is an incredible game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes deckbuilders, roguelikes, or really just anyone who likes good games. This implementation is mostly fine with exactly one flaw - tapping on and casting cards is very clunky. Somethng about the touch detection is off. With a simple fix this would be a perfect game, but right now it's a big enough flaw that I need to dock a star. Please fix clicking on cards in your hand.

product, working, Frequently hangs when communicating with server. No its not my connection causing this. Daily leader board doesn't work properly it never shows my score. Game is fun, too bad the developer doesn't care to make a properly working product.
game, Amazing, Amazing game but currently saving is unreliable. If they fix that, then it's 5 stars.
cards, Deselecting, Love the game on PC, Xbox, Switch. Android? Finish runs and the game crashes, losing Ascension unlocks, but runs appear in Run History. I've had all characyer unlocks reset twice as well, but still had Ascension levels after I completed runs with each... Deselecting cards is difficult and not intuitive. Port needs work, but base game play is as usual awesome!
killer, balanced, I absolutely love this game and I'm very happy that it's finally on Android. I have played over 200 hours on PC, this game is a well balanced and engaging time killer. On Android I have put over 300 hours. Nothing has more replay value.

saves, overwrite, PC Game is great but this is just a mess. Sync Issues overwrite saves, so I lose progress on ongoing runs all the time. There are no options for sync or google play, let alone the possibility to manually choose a save location. Changing languages seems to mess with sync also. UI controls are also not good. It's very hard to deselect a card and easy to accidentally play the wrong one. Controls are often clunky. It's like you can still feel the leftovers of PCs mouse control working against you.

game, saved, I love this game & I've wasted 100s of hours playing it, but the Android version is unreliable because saving is so hit & miss. When I try to resume a saved game, it's a crapshoot. Sometimes I load in with no issue, but a good majority of the time I either load in to an old file with lost progress, load into a whole different file (sometimes not even the same character), or there's no data to load & I have to start a new run. It's very frustrating constantly losing progress and starting over.

gameplay, Super, Game is 5/5, app is 2-3/5. Super solid gameplay and definitely worth the money but the app itself is dysfunctional and slow. If the devs keep up the good work then it could be pretty much perfect soon enough. Edit: Just got a TMobile revvl 5g and the game doesn't want to even boot up. Contacted support but I doubt they will be of much help. I still recommend the game but be aware that some hardware may not be compatible.

kinks, few, Love this game and I would say it's a must play if you are a fan of Roguelikes. Sadly it has a few kinks and bugs so it'll stay four stars for now.
builder, Exceptional, Exceptional deck builder. I have it on steam as well and literally lost my marbles when I realized it could be purchased for mobile! Screw all the mobile garbage! I can finally play a GOOOOOD game on my phone!

issues, syncing, Game is great. Love being able to play it while I'm away from the PC. But it only gets 3 stars because the syncing issues are pretty terrible. I've been halfway though a run, and then come back to have it sync up with a run that I did 3 attempts earlier. Or it will just lose the run altogether. Very strange.
cards, correct, I love the game, BUT the controls are horrible. I am struggling to play the correct cards and have multiple times lost a run because of them

game, Great, Great game but cloud saves are forced and they're broken. Takes forever to "sync" when you load the game (like 30 to 60 seconds of nothing)... then it might load a save/run from days ago. Fix this, guys. I'm sick of that stupid syncing screen.

runs, multiple, Multiple save losses that have ruined multiple runs. I feel like I wasted my money on mobile and should have bought the PC version instead. I hate rating games this low but it is incredible how a game published by Humble cannot handle single player save data. Cloud syncing takes forever and yet cannot seem to work correctly. I just want to play the game that I bought with money. The last update was in March too? I should've checked before dropping money.

runs, entire, Works well enough on pixel 3a; unplayable on wife's pixel 5a. Generally refuses to save progress and entire runs are often erased for no reason. Fantastic game but this port has some serious stability issues for the saves.

signal, spotty, Gameplay is 5 star Minus one star because it has lost my progress on 3 occasions when I had spotty signal. When I had no signal it worked great, and when I have good signal it worked. When I had spotty signal it would revert to a save from a few sessions ago very often.

menu, main, This game is incredible but the performance on phones is atrocious. More than half the time it crashes before I even get to the main menu because of "Data Syncing" failures. If you want to play this I'd recommend any other platform. This is a miserable port, not worth the money at all.

The game itself is gold. The port has two massive issues. Syncing sometimes glitches out nd it reverts you a couple of moves back if you save & quit. My biggest gripe nd this is why Im dropping a 1 star is whenever I start or finish a session, 1/2 the time the game locks up and I have to force close it. Thn problem 1 happens

cards, select, This game is really good and clever, but the touch controls on my phone are really bad. I keep trying to look out select cards but instead another card gets played and messes up my game. It's very frustrating. I was expecting better from a 15$ purchase...
controls, mobile, The mobile controls are a bit awkward compared to PC, but this is one of the best strategy games of all time.

flaw, simple, not really fun, simple design flaw ruins this game really, and that is that you have to beat the game with all 3 original characters and if you have trouble with one of those progression is over on the others too, until you win with the character your having problems with, which after 48 hours with ironclad lossing 187 times i am uninstalling, beat the game with silent and defect in less than 10 hours each, another 20 on the watcher (whose about as bad as the ironclad). rng is terrible.

game, Super, Super good game, love the progression. Absolutely hate all my runs getting wiped for no reason. Having to start the game over after being 6 hours deep is frustrating. I cant believe they are charging $10 for a game that wont even save your progress reliably in 2021. Hope they fix the game but until then dont buy it.

port, mobile, Love the PC game, console version is good, and the mobile port is great .... except for syncing errors. App closes, runs are lost, and even after winning a run my game freezes. Really kills me that after spending all this time winning an ascension run, I have the game freezes on me. So I don't even get to advance up my ascensions. I love the game so I am happy I paid for it but please fix this. Don't forget about your mobile players 🙏

time, more, Buggy mess, avoid this version, not worth the cost. Sometimes trying to pick a card makes me question my ability to use a touchscreen. I have spent more time waiting on "syncing data" than I have playing the game, and when I look online for a fix, I see it's been a problem since February. It's a shame cause the game is good when it works.
game, Best, Best game in the universe!
issues, worth, The game works just fine. I've had no issues worth reporting
lame, Super, The game lost my ascension level for the defect. Super lame.
plateau, same, I can count on one hand the amount of PC game ports that are equal or better on mobile, and STS is one of them. The level of addiction and time this game game kill is almost on the same plateau as FTL: Faster Than Light.
game, Amazing, Amazing, genre defining game with a complete trash port. Syncing takes 5 mins every time you start up the game, UI is tiny, the game freezes and crashes every time your character does their dying animation. Extremely disappointing since I adore slay the spire and always wanted a mobile port. It's bad enough that I wish I could refund. At least SNKRX works!

file, save, ive played the game before on xbox and my iphone and it works fine but I cant even start a save file on my pixlebook without this game freezing :/
game, great, Its a really great game and super enjoyable, giving endless content for you. The reason I give 2 stars instead of 5 is that the game crashes on death a lot and now when I try open it, it stops my whole phone from working then after 2 minutes finally says it crashes. Its a little annoying not to get to play considering I bought the game.

game, amazing, This is an amazing game on all platforms but for the love of God fix it from crashing on start up and death scenes. It used to not be like this and I don't know why it's so prominent now.
locations, multiple, I love this game but syncing is extremely unreliable. Even after save and quitting from settings I was sent multiple locations behind. What a joke lol. Can't rate a 10$ mobile game that can't even save progress more than 1 stars. Sorry.

game, Great, Great game. Great replay value, addictive too. Only con is the touch control can be off a little. I play it and the Nintendo switch too and it's better there. But overall it's still a fantastic game on Android, highly recommended.

amount, large, The game seems fun with a large amount of content, the reason for the low score is the controls. Deselecting a card just straight doesn't work and attempting to do so might result in playing that card or just selecting some other random card. If they fix that the score will increase.

loop, great, Really great gameplay loop. The controls are a bit wonky on mobile compared to pc but can highly recommend this game
part, top, The game is a lot of fun, but a strip on the top part of the window was cut on my device (Motorola Edge). Couldn't find any settings that helped with that, so I requested a refund... Will definitely buy again on PC!
platforms, other, Core game is just as addictive and solid as on other platforms. Shame this particular port is let down by constant syncing, frequent freezes and occasional crashes, potentially losing your progress entirely.

price, full, A bit of time to load, but I'm not sure what problems people are talking about. The game saves and syncs correctly and is extremely smooth!(my phone is old) Nice buy even at full price.
boss, 3rd, Gamer crashes after beating 3rd act boss and does not save run so i make no progress in the game unable to unlock anything

port, executed, Poorly executed port of the excellent PC title. Expect to lose your progress if you can't sit through a 30+ minute run. I've experienced bugs in this version that were absent on the PC version. So frustrating that I don't want to play. If these issues are fixed it would be 5 starts.

fix, major, The touch controls need a major fix, why is it so difficult to deselect a card?
model, upgraded, Worked fine on my Moto G7 and now doesn't work on an upgraded model, Moto G9. Other bugs like sync issues were over lookable but now it seems like the release was really hamfisted. Refund requested. Try it out after the developer has ironed out some of the issues.

Don't build towards anything specific build to fill every need and be open to repeating yourself the replay-ability of this game is amazing and it is well worth the challenge. It took me 38 hours to get my first win with over 99 loses that on my 100th game I won. Determination and well thought out synergy is key to victory. 10/10

controls, simplest, I really liked the game on Xbox so I wanted it on mobile. but for a game that's entirely about clicking and dragging cards, they somehow managed to mess up the simplest controls. cards have this awkward floaty animation that can make them block your other cards. misclicking on one can leave it selected and make you accidentally use it when you don't want to. the gameplay itself is the same as anywhere else, but the abysmal controls make this a terrible port

roguelikes, best, one of the best roguelikes ever is on mobile. granted this port is among the worst ways to play the game, but it's still the same game. better than basically any other app as far as depth of strategy for a roguelike goes.

game, Amazing, Amazing game so badly let down by the syncing.
games, most, This is basically a rogue-like which takes a lot of influence from board games like Dominion. All the decks are well balanced and the difficulty curve, while steep, is almost never unfair. As is the case with most card games, sometimes you might just have bad draw after bad draw and the loss might feel cheap but that's just the nature of all such games. The artwork is beautiful and the cards' special effects are also well done. One negative - The game has inconsistent touch recognition.

I mean just general replies to let people know the port is still being worked on (or not).

bugs, lazy, I love everything about the PC version, but this port has some lazy bugs. Please implement disabling cloud saving, since it is STILL a mess on the Android version. Will improve my rating when this happens.

complaint, only, The only complaint I have is that when playing with a phone case the potions are hard to click. Should be an option to put them more on the center of the screen.
cards, last, Can't seem to unlock the last three remaining cards as the defect... I hope there's a fix here. Thanks.

release, original, Everything I loved from the original PC release now goes everywhere with me in my phone. 10/10 would climb again.

boss, 3rd, Very unhappy after playing a playthrough for 2 hours having the game crash when I beat the 3rd final boss resulting in all progress being lost... unacceptable after paying $10 for the game. It's also really annoying to choose your cards in battle. It often will play a card when you're trying to select a different one. Either fix game breaking issues, or don't charge $10 lol

menu, main, The main menu will not load. Syncing data is always in the corner. Game is fantastic on switch and PC but it looks like this port is not ready.
second, first, I really enjoy the game but ever since I had to factory reset my phone, I can't even launch the app without it crashing within the first second. I'm completely unable to play the game and I have no idea why.
games, best, Honestly one of the best games ever made, I comeback to it again and again. This is my third time buying it and I'm just as happy doing so as the last two times. My only regret is the effect having it on my phone will have on my sleep and productivity. Also this time around has really made me realize how well balanced this game is, as I have beaten it once in all 3 characters and defeated the heart as the silent before I was even max level on any character! Really lets me know how far I've come

I hope the next game these fantastic developers make, they steer clear of this company.
recognition, Awful, Awful touch recognition, takes 30 years to save data. Just get the pc version and cry that there is no good portable way to play this. Also no data syncing between platforms? Like really?

play, same, The same great game play found on other platforms. However, there are a few issues. 1. The syncing takes way too long upon launch. Then what's with the constant pulsing of text in the top right corner. 2. Selecting cards can be irritating. Deselecting after you let go of the card would help. 3. My scores on the daily challenge aren't being added to the leader board. Great to have a portable version of one of my favorite games, but could still use some updates.

game, Amazing, OG decl builder. Amazing game.
platform, preferred, Super good. Mobile is my preferred platform for this game, my only gripes are that the text is a bit small. Otherwise it's just super good, I'm not usually one for card-based games, but I always end up getting sucked back into this. Recommended for sure.

Months later.... Still unopenable....... And when I contacted to get a refund I got a run around from both the company and the play store. Completely unexaptable....

way, only, Kinda annoying that the only way to unlock the last character is by beating the game... Kinda like buying a game but you can't actually unlock all the material.

hours, many, I put so many hours into PC version i don't wanna play the mobile one... I wish there was a steam synchronisation. I'll come back when there is one, for now, i refunded
game, good, While this is a good game the mobile experience is pretty awful. It's not optimized for mobile at all, often times selecting wrong cards. It also has a problem with just losing your in progress run. Pretty disappointing, hopefully this will get fixed

game, Great, Great game, port is meh. I accidentally hit things I don't mean to, a lot.
game, Good, Good game. But the Google play integration is really bad. I hoped this would work offline like the pc version. Also expecting some work on the controls. It's by no means unbearable, but sometimes it leads to a loss of control.
game, Awesome, Awesome game.
levels, unlocked, Act 4 bugged. I've beaten the game with every character and unlocked ascension levels and still can't access the keys to go to act 4 and fight the heart. Will change if fixed.
builder, best, Still the best rogue-lite deck builder. The port is good too.

games, actual, One of the actual best games I've ever played and it's on my phone (?!). I had over 600 hours with this on the Switch and now have a similar amount on Android. That's an insane amount of quality, engaging, varied gameplay for such a small amount. Megacrit have created the definitive deckbuilding roguelike here. It simply cannot be beaten (literally if you're playing for a heart kill at A20 with the Silent).

game, great, A great game, a not so great port. It's quick to get used to the horrible touch recognition but it's always present. You have to actively work against the game so that you don't cast a wrong card accidentally since it has a really hard time recognizing just what card you're trying to select, and once that selection is made getting out of it to select another card is also a pain. Three stars because the game is just so much fun for me I can get through it, but man what a misstep of a port.

things, good, Had only heard good things about this game, and I see why. I feel like it lends itself really well to the mobile platform as well. Addicting, drop-out whenever, roguelite, no mtx, no stamina. A rare 5/5

take, paid, A paid take on the standard rogue like card game, with relics, random events, and 4 classes. You have a terrible starting deck regardless of class that cannot be customized, and you are at the mercy of RNG to be able to even play the game. A single lucky pull will have you effortlessly run over the game, and a poor streak will render any amount of planning obsolete. Controls on mobile are screwy and you get half minute long load screens while the game tries to sync to server. Overall meh 3/10

time, much, The game base is really good (I play the game on console too), but the Android port is really bad. "Syncing data" to much time when you open the game (you cannot see the main menu until it finishes) The cards and buttons are too small. Changing the selected card of the hand it's troublesome. It's needed to aim at the enemy for an attack, it will be better if you can permanently select an enemy that it will receive all your attacks. Sometimes the app freezes when you die.

bugs, Minor, Love the game. Minor bugs: defragment power for the defect is not an "exhaust" card but exhausts itself anyways. Fighting the champion as the immortal and got a 3 card limit on my turn without having anything that should limit it.

card, Fixed, Mobile UI is poor - too fiddly to select cards, and easy to make mistakes. Fixed card positions would work better than the floaty way they're handled now. Game frequently saves incorrectly. Music plays on title load even with sound off (so annoying!) Game itself is fine. I personally don't find it quite loves up to its hype - it has a lot of junk in the system and a lot of time wasting, and the build options are limited by constrained class selection. Entertaining enough, but not the best RL.

game, fun, Extremely fun game, literally the worst UI on a phone game I've ever dealt with, basically the cards don't like to be dropped back into your hand, so you'll swipe a card 10x trying to get it to displace down, very frustrating for an overall incredibly fun game. The interface is so bad it knocks it from being a 5 star game down to a 2 star, I would suggest it, but damn is that annoying

Only issue with this version is the controls for the cards I'd like to drag any car but for this game it feels like it wants you to click on cards then enemies but im so used to the pc version I like the dragging way

game, Great, Great game. Mobile version is awesome! Just wanted to mention that my silent character is at ascention 10 and yet 3 cards are still locked. Im wondering if it's a bug? All my characters are at LVL 5.

card, different, The game is great, port is awful. The touch controls are terrible. Some reviews mention it being fixed, not for me. When you touch a card it stays selected, even after releasing the screen. It's hard to select a different card or use any part of the UI without playing the selected card. You will lose games because of the controls. The game saves to the cloud, and messes up regularly. One time I put my phone for 5 minutes mid-run. When I came back the game 'synced' and my run was gone.

page, past, It's always a gamble whether the app will crash before it opens past loading page, or it will take five minutes to finish syncing data and then load, which is a real shame because I love the web version of this. Please fix it.

reviews, other, Never played the PC version but I enjoyed this game a lot on my switch. I've had no issues from what other reviews have said. It runs better on my phone than on the switch :(
games, best, 5 stars for one of the best games I've ever played. This game created an entirely new genre (roguelike deckbuilders), and is incredibly balanced. The touch controls could certainly be better, mostly in terms of how you select/deselect cards in your hand, but otherwise its a really solid port. I have over 190 hours now in this Android version, and even after all that playtime, I'm still only at Ascension 11 or 12 (out of 20) for all of the characters. Strongly recommend this game.

game, fun, It's a really fun game, I'd say the gameplay works even better for quick mobile sessions than on PC. One big problem though is that your progress is deleted sometimes when you save & quit. That kills all the fun, especially if you had a good run and lose all your progress. With better saving options it would be 5 stars! Update: Downgrading my rating. It's just no fun when you had a great run and the game didn't save it. Also apparently Run History doesn't sync across devices.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game I've put many hours into on PC. This mobile port isn't great, but it's not terrible. It isn't unoften that I play a wrong card or choose a wrong item from inaccurate controls. The game also sometimes forgets saved data, erasing current runs. This is not a huge deal but worth mentioning: the loading time when you open the game (syncing data) takes a long time. Besides these things, I am still happy to be able to play conveniently on the go. :)

way, possible, RNG is always against me in every way possible.
game, fun, Love this game. I'm addicted!! Such a fun and challenging game. I will always enjoy playing this. It will never get old for me. Well Done!
games, best, The misclicks are very real. UI bugs need to be fixed. Otherwise one of the best games ever created.
game, great, A great game and love it on the PC but this port is not great. Takes long to start the game, crashes, and is hard to select the cards to play
problem, large, So as much as I'd love to give this a 5 star, there is one large problem I and others run into. The problem is the sometimes wonky selection of cards, and I use my phone's stylus BECAUSE I read the other reviews, so it's not a "fat finger" issue. It's mostly happens when you select a card to use or read the description, but it won't easily let you select a different card; It kind of "sticks" to the card you have selected. This often results in misplaying cards.

days, few, Crashes on startup now after working for a few days. Tried clearing the app data & cache, as well as completely reinstalling. Bummer, wish I could refund.
port, OK, If you've never played StS before it's a must buy - 5/5 game... but its an OK 'port'. While I have not had most of the issues mentioned in other reviews (slow loading, crashes and corrupt save data). I have had some lag during death blows and the controls are sometimes janky. (I have had to turn down my sensitivity on android gestures because it kept doing that over card movements). Played on S21Ultra.

location, same, Plays just like the desktop version and is still just as fun! Even better considering it can be while on the go! Why there's no 5/5: I have a Pixel 5 and the camera punchout is in the same location as the deck icon, so I can't even tap to see the deck. Rotating to the other side would be a nice bonus. Also the fact that I cant sync with my desktop version to have Ascension 10+ already unlocked; gotta play the game again - which isn't too terrible of a tradeoff but would be nice to have.

times, random, Just too random loading times. Sometimes it takes a second, other times it either takes 10 minutes or just freezes forever

game, Awesome, Awesome game. Easy to get into and lots to learn to get good along with great pacing. Really love the game and would love to dive deeper, but unfortunately the controls are so bad that I can't recommend it. How prone you are to accidentally playing cards and making irreversible moves combined with roguelike mechanics is just game breaking. Half my runs come to a stop cause I misplay a card while trying to read what it does then I get annoyed and move on to something else.

game, Amazing, Amazing game I have for the PC, switch and now on the phone! However on the phone when casting to a TV it tends to freeze and crash my phone ;-;
game, Great, Great game, but very glitchy. Run wins sometimes don't register. I got up to Ascention 19, and then due to a sync error, ended up back on Ascension 1.
game, good, Very good game, it's the same as the PC version. it's rare to see PC games getting ported directly without dumbing it down and adding micro transactions/ads. 10/10
ads, micro, Very good game, it's the same as the PC version. it's rare to see PC games getting ported directly without dumbing it down and adding micro transactions/ads. 10/10
fight, latest, This game is absolutely amazing, however this version is not very optimized for mobile. If your game gets minimized there's a chance you'll have to re-do your latest fight or instance, or worse your ENTIRE RUN! I'm not too keen on playing this when there's a chance I'll loose it all... Again... I was doing so well too! :'(
card, different, I loved this game on pc very glad its on mobile now too but the system to play cards need some work because I'll try to play a card and sometimes a completely different card gets played instead but other than that it's very enjoyable and smooth
difficulty, high, Finally in app form! Surprisingly relaxing game considering the rouge like high difficulty and intense art.

history, entire, This game is amazing except for a game breaking bug that prevents me from finushing runs. The "sleep" button after act 3 crashes the game and the entire run history isnt recorded. Like it never happened. I can't keep playing this amazing game that i happily paid for until they fix this.

game, incredible, This is a port of an incredible PC game. The PC game is my favorite roguelike, hands down. This is the exact same game. That makes this a fantastic game worth the money. Sadly, it's a direct port. The UI is phone-unfriendly and works poorly. The game is still 10/10, but the controls are awful. You'll get used to it, but it's a shame nonetheless.

problem, new, Leaving a 2 star review because I really really like the game but it's currently bugged with no way to fix it! Every time I die the game freezes and needs to be restart and the resets to 10+ rooms earlier if not more. If I abandon the run and start a new one same problem happens with all 4 characters, please fix this so I can enjoy the game and I'll come change this to the 5 star review it deserves!

support, troubleshooting, I wish I could play it. I did a factory erase of my phone and now it won't let me download the game again. I've don't all the troubleshooting, contacted support, and I still can play.

loading, intial, Fix for the long intial loading time, when the game is syncing data, try going to home screen and come back in, works for me! Brilliant game, needs a few minor fixes like sometimes the game freezes at a win and player will lose the entire run, and the constant "saving" messages are annoying. Otherwise 5 stars. Minor issues really, also wish there was more content.

dang, pretty, The game itself is phenomenal, but the phone version is unstable and unreliable. I've been playing this pretty dang frequently over the past couple weeks and it's super fun, but I've had significant progress deleted twice due to the game's subpar cloud save system and poor performance on both my note8 and Galaxy 21 ultra. Lots of game crashes, corrupt save files ruining progress and deleting statistics. Buy the pc version

complaint, only, After reading reviews I was really doubting to buy this game. But I did it and don't regret it. Haven't had any problems with data synchronization. Controls are okay, but not 100% accurate, and that's the reason I give it 4 stars. When you try to look at a card, they kind of pop out a bit and stay there. And when you try to drag another card to play, you might accidentally play the one you looked at. That's my only complaint, otherwise great game.

game, Super, Super fun game, but very hard to play on a phone, WAY too easy to select wrong cards and severely affect your run. no way to go back or undo, one wrong tap and you're done. Sync and loading can be an issue but not bad. Some sort of confirmation would be nice and make the game more playable

run, abandoned, It's playing well on my phone, but for some reason the watcher character isn't working right. When they collapse on the floor (sleep when winning, defeat, or abandoned run) the game crashes. Other than that though it's doing fine.
game, played, I have to edit my review 😓. I had 5 stars because this is my most played game on PC. I've been playing it almost daily since release. Then.. the syncing issues started. Sometimes I want to just hop into a quick game, but I have to sit at the main screen waiting for sync. Finally done syncing. I play 30 minutes, beat a boss or two. Come back an hour later and boot my game up.. waiting for sync.. ok.. I'm back in the first act. Please fix this. Reducing stars every time I lose progress. This sad.

bugs, many, Too many bugs. Crashes every time i die
port, bad, As everyone else, love the game, don't like the bad port. The game just freezes after winning a run and every other tap triggers a data sync with accompanying annoying text. I haven't found a convenient way to put down a selected card since a two-finger tap doesn't do it and moving it back to the bottom is a 50/50 on whether it'll be played instead. Which is too bad, because selecting the correct card is very inconvenient when your hand is full. Hope this'll be improved some day.

run, current, Forgets current run when switching away from the app. Controls are not perfect. Pita to deselect a card
card, worst, To be clear, I absolutely love Slay the Spire and when it came out on mobile I was super psyched. The controls, however, are so clunky that for me it's almost unplayable on mobile. As much as I try not to, I often end up playing cards I didn't intend to play. There's also often no confirmation messages. Just now I ended up accidentally duplicating the worst card in my deck by a mistouch. Please fix the controls devs and I'll rate this 5 stars easy.
characters, first, Love this game. I've beaten ascension 20 on the first three characters, but every time I beat ascension 6 on watcher, the game crashes and I can no longer progress. Samsung galaxy s21 note ultra. Keep up the good work guys.

version, mobile, I adore sts but the mobile version just has to many annoyances for me to want to play it. I can't even check my draw pile because that's where my phone has the camera holepunch. How come I can't tap a card I enlarged to make it return to small size? Etc.

phone, small, Could you please add scaling options? Things can be difficult to read on a small phone. I'd appreciate it a lot.
game, Great, Great game, shame how the port was handled, shocking how long syncing data takes, I paid so make it offline. The controls are horrendous
game, fun, This is a fun game and is enjoyable. However, it would be far better if it didn't crash every time I die... Not to mention I lose progress when I load the game back up and try to continue the quest. I wouldnt be upset had I not paid $10 for this game, If it were free I could uninstall and move on. I'd really like a refund but I'm sure that will never happen.
game, good, Please speed up the synching. It's ridiculously slow. Otherwise a really good game. But it's so annoying waiting for the synch.
lagging, bad, 4 star, 1 star missing due to the bad freezing/lagging when data is synching. This happens after a win or when launching the game
game, Great, Great game but the mobile controls are very poor and theres a glitch preventing you from raising ascension levels.

difference, Only, It's just like the PC version that I hired back when I had a PC.

bugs, little, I absolutely love this game. However, code got messed up for mobile. Deleting runs and the app just freezing and getting the 'app is not responding' message consistently. Pls fix these little bugs so i can enjoy this game on the go. Right now it's hard to when things get deleted or the app just crashes.
eggs, easter, Fun and full of easter eggs and different strats. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the card selection mechanism sucks and cards will stick to your fingers but it's still a 5 star game even with that.

ability, bad, Devs haven't touched this game since March. Meanwhile, we are constantly calling out how horrifically bad the ability to deselect a card or potion is. I'm always inadvertently using a card I didn't want to or a potion. Hit me up devs. I have plenty of suggestions to help remediate this.
hours, many, So many hours in this game! Worth every penny
port, good, This game is clearly a 5/5, and I've sunk hundreds of hours into it on PC and mobile, but I have to dock a star for the Android port. It's just not a good port; it doesn't handle well, there are several bugs and glitches that can easily frustrate you or cause you to play the wrong card, and the "Syncing data" message is leading to absurdly long load times. It's still the best game on the Play Store.

issue, slight, I absolutely adore this game. I've played a couple hundred hours on my computer, and finally had to buy it for mobile so that I could play on the go. There is one slight issue, though: when I switch to another app to do something else (check emails, turn on Spotify, etc.) it will occasionally totally forget the current run. There's no longer a continue prompt, and the run isn't in the run history. I'm unsure if this is an issue with the game or my phone, but it's the only issue I've experiened

game, Great, Great game overall but like other bad reviews on the mobile version, the game takes waay to long to load initially. Not too big of a deal, it's like a minute for me. But what bothers me is that during this tine the game is supposedly synching and saving your gameplay...which is definitely NOT the case because I came back from taking a break playing a 50+ minute run and there was no option for me to continue it.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, but garbage Android app. For fans considering getting the game to play on their phone, I recommend using steamlink instead. Reasons the Android app sucks: (1) Insanely slow load. (2) Extreme battery usage. (3) Poor syncing issues--be prepared to lose entire runs. (4) Almost no UI changes. No, I'm not kidding--it's the same game UI as designed for a large, desktop screen just shrunk down on a phone. Trying to click the options menu without hitting deck or map is pretty freaking hard. Also, in some scenarios, like when you have a full hand, you CAN"T target your left-most card when target-card-in-hand effects play (like choose a card to discard). So, you know, the game is 5 stars, the app is 2 at best.

Reasons the Android app sucks: (1) Insanely slow load. (2) Extreme battery usage. (3) Poor syncing issues--be prepared to lose entire runs. (4) Almost no UI changes. No, I'm not kidding--it's the same game UI as designed for a large, desktop screen just shrunk down on a phone. Trying to click the options menu without hitting deck or map is pretty freaking hard. Also, in some scenarios, like when you have a full hand, you CAN"T target your left-most card when target-card-in-hand effects play (like choose a card to discard). So, you know, the game is 5 stars, the app is 2 at best.

version, mobile, This game is the GOAT of card building games. The game itself is excellent. However, the mobile version kinda sucks and here's why. - UI could be vastly improved, by this I mean room for vertical layout, bigger buttons, confirmation when selecting once of cards (eg. Library). - Game crashes so so often. Examples include: I received a text My battery is low notification I plug in my phone to charge I get a call Ad Infiniti... - Crashes can wipe out your entire run - Syncing takes 25 secs avg

port, Amazing, Amazing port, plays and runs great
floors, few, I want to rate this better. I really do. But it's so frustrating when the game doesn't save your progress. Sometimes I only have time to play a few floors. The game data says it's saved, but when I open the app back up my game is no longer there and I have to start a new one. Why say "game saved" when that feature only works 25% of the time?

controls, better, Fun but picking cards out of your hand is very difficult. Needs better controls.
time, first, The cloud syncing is just a nightmare. It has been deleting my saves since the first time I bought this game. PC version is the way to go, this is just an awful port.

time, whole, Game is excellent! It's mechanics are very well thought out and easy to understand, and has me absorbed the whole time!

boxes, hit, Love this game on PC, but the interface is terrible on mobile - the test, buttons, cards, hit boxes, etc are all far too small.
roguelike, best, It's the best deck building roguelike. Wanting more is plain unreasonable!
stuff, other, Fun but not complete. It's a copy and paste to andoid from PC. So if you play it on PC first you understand that somethings needs to be revamped to function on a phone. The issue I ran into the most is the potion would glitch out and not do its effects when use. There's other small stuff that glitches too. If they fix that, the game would be 5 stars for sure!

port, Terrible, Terrible port. Playing cards from your hand is a nightmare, choosing cards from your deck sometime picks the card you're scrolling past, some of the soundbites are glitchey (e.g. settings select sound, or the deselect target sound), sync saves take a bunch of time. UX is great on PC, terrible on android. Requested a refund :(

games, favorite, Slay the Spire is one of my favorite games of all time. That said the port has some issues. These are the major ones. 1. The app 'losing' runs when you close midgame and randomly finding them again several games later 2. The app occasionally not recognizing when you beat an Ascension level. This has happened to me at least 3 times, including my first time beating Asc 19, which was very frustrating. 3. it is very difficult to deselect cards or potions if you decide you no longer wish to use them

8/10, awkward, Quite nice but the control can get awkward 8/10
port, mobile, I love this game so much, but the mobile port is terrible. It randomly doesn't save progress when you complete an ascension, and will crash randomly. This is on a new note 20 as well. I'd just like to be able to progress rather than play the same difficulty over and over.

option, Bigger, Issues with auto save. Try this, exit a game midway, continue run, and exit the game again. Your auto save will be lost permanently. Also if you exit the app for a sec, the app closes (I hv 6GB RAM). Bigger text option is still relatively illegible even on my 6.2" screen, touch controls are a lil' clunky, can be improved further (e.g instead of tap to select card, let it preview card. Drag card out of hand to use instead of the current method.) A little disappointed at lack of updates from Devs.

hours, many, Love the game and have spent many hours on it. Does freeze once in a while upon death. Hasn't ruined the experience for me though. Update: I often don't get credit for my completed runs. It'll say I've unlocked the next ascension, but then I don't have it. Quite annoying.

port, android, The game is great but the android port has some issues. Specifically syncing issues and controls for selecting/deselecting cards. These aren't gamebreaking but for the price, its disappointing. And I see many users reporting cloud saves aren't working, which is really really bad. If these issues are patched then its easily a 5 star app. Thank you.

port, android, Love slay the spire and the android port is awesome! not sure where to report bugs but ring of the serpent gives 7 cards every turn instead of 6
music, loud, Even with all sound and music muted, plays incredibly loud opening music when loaded up. Not to mention the frequent freezing after a win that other reviews have mentioned. Come on guys, this is basic stuff.

ascension, new, I love slay the spire but I keep having an issue where I'll beat an Ascension and it will tell me I've unlocked the next one but then the new ascension isn't available to play.
times, many, No matter how many times I win I keep coming back to this. Best phone game on the market!

games, few, One of the very few Android games that don't suck, probably because it wasn't originally developed for Android. It is a little annoying that I can't preview my deck on my Pixel 4a due to the stupid camera hole punch though. But that's more Google's fault.

game, entertaining, Reviews are too harsh on this title. This is hands-down the most entertaining mobile game I've played and deserves far more recognition. Nothing else has kept my attention for hours. It has some annoying quirks in the control scheme - card deselection is particularly painful. Why not tap to select/deselect, and drag to use? A very faithful port that could do with some tweaking.

release, recent, Twice that I have won now, the game has neglected to save my progress. And this is not a very recent release either, so I doubt that they will try to do anything about this.
exists, anti, Game takes 30 seconds to boot every time you open because it's "syncing data". When I uninstalled and reinstalled later, my save was gone. What exactly was syncing, and why did I have to wait so long for it, exactly? Why can't I disable it? It's not syncing with Steam which would be cool, it's clearly not backing up my progress, I am completely baffled that such an anti-feature exists. Game is great btw.

experience, smooth, Love the game but the sync is awful. Hope this gets fixed. I have it on iOS and I hate to say it but iOS port runs like butter. This needs to be on par with iOS. I love my pixel 4xl and it's why I came back to android. Glad this game finally released on Android was excited. It just needs to get sync fixed. Shouldn't be so slow. I have this game on switch as well so I'm supporting the game. So please give us android users a smooth experience as well.Thanks for your work game developers.
problem, specific, Four stars because of one specific problem. I've had the game freeze upon winning multiple times, usually after seeing your damage to the heart but before unlocks/breakdown of your score. It also just deletes your run. Normally you can just restart the game and continue where you left off but instead (since the run is "over") you lose an hour of time and don't get the win. This is not a rare crash. Small sample size but I'd say 1/4 wins will crash and not get credited. Pretty lame

deck, great, With any card game there is rng and luck involved. This one is no different. You can build a great deck from advancing just to get to the boss and be completely I'll equipped to deal with it. Some of the cards are just a complete waste to pick up and often you will do runs where you get to the boss and only have one additional card to your starting attacks and defense. That simply isn't powerful enough to defeat a boss or sometimes even an elite. Addicting though..

cloud, saving, The game is excellent but not this version. The saving system / cloud syncing is broken and it directly breaks the game. Buy another version of the game in PC or a console.
time, first, Game worked two times. The first time I got three characters unlocked. When I came back the game deleted all my saves so I started again. Now my game will not even open. Looking to get a refund game as game is unplayable.
game, great, It's a great game but so frustrating to play on mobile. You can't even see the damage values of the cards without selecting it. It's so easy to misplay a card with the touc controls and de-selecting seems more difficult than it should be. It's too bad it's so frustrating to play as I have spend hundreds of hours on this game on PC.
game, Solid, Solid game. A few bugs on initial release seem past. I've dumped more rime than I'm willing to admit to this game.

times, Long, Generally good. Hard to choose cards at times. Long times waiting for the game to sync and load. Can you seriously not allow for local saving?! It'd be much faster. Would be nice if the save data doesn't get corrupt every now and then too.

port, android, The game is excellent but the android port is terrible. I keep hitting "End turn" when reaching for cards to the right on my phone and as hitboxes overlap, runs often end with a misclick. Move the button out of the way please! Also syncing is slooooooooow, expect 30-60 seconds for the game to "boot".
time, poor, Very poor performance / loading time at the beginning due to syncing issue. Steam version is much better. Other than that, gameplay is about identical to Steam version.

hours, many, So there is a bit of getting used to the touch controls, but one you get it it feels right at home. Spent too many hours on the toilet playing this game.

games, best, 100+ hrs no freeze no crash. You can accidentally play a card time to time. Still best mobile games I've ever played. Highly recommend.

love, Great, Great game love this game so much
game, abandon, Nearly perfect! However sometimes the game stalls out and crashes when a run is over (Victory,Death,or even abandon game). Even so, enough fun that I just close the app and start again.

reason, main, Gets a 1-star for one main reason: tapping Save & Quit will let you pick up a run where you left off if you DO NOT close the app. If you save and quit and close the app, your run is deleted. Doesn't even count as a loss, just gone completely. I have over 500 hours in this game on PC alone. This port is laughable.
game, Great, Great game, sometimes the synchronization with Google Play is a bit laggy but other than that great port to mobile!

controls, poor, Could have been great. But marred by bugs and poor controls. And saved games are randomly deleted making it almost unplayable.

game, original, The original game is amazing but this mobile port is horrible. Crashing after every defeat, taking forever for the game to load and the worst one yet is saving the game only to come back and your save is gone. I love the game but this port needs to seriously work to become enjoyable

freedom, less, Good, but maybe not as ridiculously good as others harp about. There is less freedom to builds than people indicate, and less than other similar games have. Still, it set the bar early on and it is enjoyable.

joy, same, I love the game on PC and you definitely get the same joy on mobile but there are some frustrating issues with the app. Every time you start the app it needs to sync for an unreasonable amount of time. If it's just some save states it really can't be taking that long. At least on my phone it's very difficult to deselect the active card potentially leading to game losses by playing a card you didn't want to play. Maybe there is a way I didn't figure out yet

game, great, The port for touch devices is not very good, but is playable. Other than that, this is a great game as the internet already knoes.
game, Great, Great game. Been loving it on PC in the past. Only problem I occurred is, that when it said it unlocked ascension 2, it didn't unlock at all. I'm still at Ascension 1.
loss, Constant, Constant loss of sync and reset issues
loop, unplayable, Game keeps crashing and reseting a run when I win or die. It is an unplayable time loop of a port. Support told me they couldn't do anything. Waste of my time, waste of my money, buy it on Steam instead and save yourselves some grief.
version, mobile, The game is great on PC. The mobile version fails is constantly synching yet fails to synch. This leads you to think you've saved your game only to lose all progress. Don't waste your time here.
controls, bad, Amazing if not for the bad controls. This is conceptually the perfect phone game. It is great. The only issue is the user interface wasn't rebuilt to work with touch. Accidentally opening menus, choosing cards you didn't intend to, and tapping stuff that won't work because your other hand is brushing the screen are common and frustrating issues. Devs, go play a few rounds of hearthstone on mobile and straight copy that feel. Otherwise your great game is just meh. 3 rounds lost to bad UI.

menu, main, The game is good (have pc version)but there are issues with the app itself: - Launching the app takes ages to get to the main menu, it says it is synching data (dont see an online component here to be synchronisation, unless for the daily ladder?) - Card picking - when picking a card, it really is hard to unpick it, there are a lot of times when I send the wrong card because I cant unpick it) - Crashes - there are two places where I get app crashes, main menu when synching or when I die in game.

score, low, The game itself is incredible- Mega Crit created a masterpiece. The low score is due to the terrible state of the cloud saves. I installed the game on a new phone, and not only did it fail to sync my hundred+ hour save over, it overwrite my progress on my old phone with my new 0 hour save from my new one. Normally I'm pretty forgiving about development, it's harder than people think, but come on. At least throw up a prompt before you completely nuke an account.

game, favorite, The game itself is 10/10, currently my favorite game when it's on Steam. But here it seems like so little effort was put into this project because the interface and motions are...exactly the same. And you will misclick things constantly. Choices, cards, paths, items, anything. Its a pain physically play and therefore is also a distraction from the mental aspect of the game. It is servicable sometimes, but I also kind of hate it. But again, you should play Slay the Spire on some platform.

version, android, This game is one of my favorites. I have over 200 hours in it. However, this android version is poorly ported. On my Pixel 4XL, if you lose a run, the game crashes. If you win a run, the game crashes. If you abandon a run, the game crashes. If you try to continue a run, the game crashes. The only way the game works is if you have a new run, no run to abandon or continue. Otherwise, you can not play. I have reported this to the developers three times, and it has not changed.

Avoid at all cost and play on literally any other platform instead. It is almost insulting that they would *sell* this. Been 4 months since the last patch as well. Safe to say its been abandoned.

game, Great, Great game, the problem is the app is terrible. Never played it on pc nad I still have fun, but many things are making my experience way worse. When I abandon, the game crashes 70% percent of the time. Sometimes, the game randomly goes to somewhere I barely remember or sets me back 30 minutes I've already done. Without those issues, this would be an easy 5 stars for me, but until then, I can't.

game, good, Can no longer use on Galaxy S20. Glad I paid for this. Crashes on startup every time. But obviously is a really good game.
issues, several, First off I love the game itself. However, I've run across several issues. Cloud sync does not work for me, at least not between my Note 20 Ultra and my Tab S4. Makes the delays from "syncing" seem pointless. The other issue I've come across is after finishing a run snd closing the game it will start me back at the last fight. It counts them as 2 separate runs so you could end with 2 losses from the same run.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, but this app version of it is terrible. It constantly freezes and crashes, the touch controls are irritating, and it takes a really long time to "sync" your game data when you first start it. And this phone is 2 months old Samsung Galaxy. Do yourself a favor and play this game on any of its other platform options, not this.

When it finally syncs and you can play it's incredibly buggy. Sometimes it saves, other times it doesn't. Sometimes cards don't load artwork. Devs need to give this game an ounce of attention and start stabilizing it.
days, past, Let me preface this by stating I absolutely adore this game and it's mechanics. But the game has just plainly stopped working in the past few days. I was without warning unable to start it, and once I attempted to reinstall it, the installation failed every time. Untill these issues are fixed I cannot give this game a good rating

game, Great, Great game nonstop playable action. However 2 things to note. 1. Had to re-download like 10 times to hopefully fix the saving issue during a run and 2. When picking which enemy to attack it is a huge hassle. So be very careful when picking your enemy the game just assumes some things some times. The golden rule however is never leave the game during a run otherwise you're basically guaranteed at least some lost progress when you return.

The golden rule however is never leave the game during a run otherwise you're basically guaranteed at least some lost progress when you return.

game, Great, Great game but this port has serious problems, most notably if you will often lose progress when the game fails to synch data. As of 7/19/21 it still hasn't been fixed.

game, Good, Good game but a terrible port. The constant data sync sucks. If you play offline then play online after, you lose your progress. Game usually crashes when the enemy kills you, when you try to abandon a game, and when you win. Literally cannot play right now because it keeps crashing when I press abandon game, and I'm abandoning the game because I already died but it crashed when the enemy hit me. Will change review once fixed.

cards, deselecting, The game is just like i remember with the pc version. It even feels better being able to take it on the go. However i do have at least one complaint. The selection system appears to have not been well optimized for mobile as i consistantly have issues with deselecting cards from hand. There should be in place some optimization where if a player takes their finger (or touch utinsil) off of the screen, any card that is touched and held should return fully to hand. Otherwise the game plays well.

game, phenomenal, Slay the Spire is a phenomenal game but this port has so many problems. It works fine most of the time except I am physically unable to unlock all the characters as they have re locked themselves. I have played on ascension 4 as ironclad but I can't play any other character. Out side of that the game constantly crashes, and resets my runs back to the beginning when it does. I'd you ever save and quit, just assume the run will not pick up where you saved it. Great game, terrible app. 2 stars.

data, syncing, A "syncing data" bug has rendered this game unplayable for many, and since the game hasn't been patched in four months, it's borderline abandoned at this point. Play it on a different platform.

run, normal, Encountered a bug? after beating a normal run where i could still continue in the main menu where it would take me straight to the heart and "beat" the game. Also the game hangs whenever i die or reach the heart and die?

game, Good, Good game on PC, but you lose all your achievments and progress if you uninstall on android. Please take this into consideration progress is slow.
issue, biggest, The game is really fun to play but the app keeps crashing regularly. Syncing is the biggest issue and this is where the app crashes most of the time. Hope they will fix this soon
issues, few, This game is awesome. Had a few ui issues on mobile but other than that no complaints.
port, mobile, You need to get your priorities right! I played the pre-release on computer (800+hrs total). I like the idea of games on the go, play when, where and how you want. But the mobile port is horrible. Not that the original is perfect. But instead of balancing the game, improving the user interface, fixing frequent input lag bugs and horrible delays on the menus, they decide to patch out minor bugs that have no negative impact to the player like closing the app several times causing a run to reset.

games, greatest, Slay the spire is one of the greatest games of all time. It's such a perfect mobile game and I have hundreds of hours in it both on Android and on Switch. Easy to jump in, addicting gameplay with a ton of replayability. These devs put so much love into the game. Only reason for 4 stars is 2 major issues: 1. It has some problems and delays when syncing data. Sometimes startup takes 15-20 seconds while it "syncs data" for example 2. Sometimes completing ascension doesn't unlock the next level.

issues, crashing, The game is fantastic but there are constant syncing and crashing issues... I have fought time eater with the same deck 3 times because it keep crashing constantly. If they could fix the crashing issues I would give it 5 stars. Until then I would avoid.

complaint, Minor, Minor complaint is the size of the text. Even with the newest update the text is still tiny. But my biggest gripe is trying to touch a card, more often than not the card gets accidently played. If the Devs can fix this card issue the game is a 5 stars for sure!

port, great, Is this a great port? No... The controls are finicky, and as a Pixel 4A user, the draw pile button is inaccessible. But it's still one of the best games you'll ever get on the Android. It's an absolutely stellar roguelite. One of the best.

review, low, I truly love this game. I've played the desktop version for years so it saddens me to give such a low review but until the Ascension glitch is fixed I've stopped playing it. If you've not experienced it, often times when you defeat an ascension rank the game will tell you that the next rank is unlocked but you won't be able to select it. Closing and reopening the game works most of the time but often you are just left to redo the run at the same rank. Not a 'feels good' moment

card, best, One of the best card games you can buy - on PC. I give the Android port a 4/5 because the save data syncing is completely broken. It routinely forgets your progress and the syncing *always* makes the app hang, and sometimes freeze entirely.

issues, serious, I love slay the spire on pc. This version has some serious issues though, mostly with syncing data, as others have mentioned. Some other bugs I've experienced: I have unlocked ascension 6 with the silent twice now and yet it still only goes up to 5 when I start a new run. Almost every time a run ends, it can take up to a full minute to return to the title screen (if it doesn't crash). Unfortunately, much as I love this game, I can't recommend buying it until these issues are resolved.

card, sticky, This is ridiculous. This port doesn't seem to care about selections you make on screen, instead playing cards at random because you weren't precise enough because of BS sticky card selection. Also, the sync data feature lost all of my data, which is a literal step down from the version of this game on console and pc.

app, developed, The game is great. The app is the worst developed app I have ever used. It crashes regularly. Worst of all, it randomly sets you back. I had to fight the heart 3 times for it to crash on the victory screen each time only to be reset to half way through the run. I've had it set me back multiple runs before. I recommend slay the spire, but play it on the computer. This app is terrible. It's definitely not worth $10 until they fix the significant issues it's dealing with.

game, brilliant, Not happy about giving a 1 star rating to such a brilliant game, but if my progress gets continually wiped on invididual runs & the overall campaign then there is no point in playing. I will revisit if they resolve these issues but the game is unplayable in current state. Stay away.

animals, mindless, As of writing this review, this app has a 4.3/5 rating due to the dedication of mindless herd animals. In reality, the fact that so many issues/bugs exist still with no update since March shows how little the developers really care about customer experience. It shows that their dedication lies with expanding their trove of gold by releasing a subpar mobile port as quickly as possible to extract wealth from another platform.

experience, best, I have 600 hours in the PC version. This is a port of that, and if you want the best experience, play on PC. Minus 1 star for constant data sync issues. You lose 30 seconds to a full minute every time the app starts to sync with something else. Why? There is no online component, this is a straight single player game. I hope I'll be able to play this in airplane mode, which is the whole reason I bought it. And then it wants to sync during each run, randomly, which causes card selection to hang. Speaking of: Minus 1 star for terrible card selection controls. If you pick a card, it is almost impossible to "unpick" it or put it back into the hand. Cards almost play themselves if you mistakenly chose them. For new players unfamiliar with all the cards, this is terrible.

player, single, I have 600 hours in the PC version. This is a port of that, and if you want the best experience, play on PC. Minus 1 star for constant data sync issues. You lose 30 seconds to a full minute every time the app starts to sync with something else. Why? There is no online component, this is a straight single player game. I hope I'll be able to play this in airplane mode, which is the whole reason I bought it. And then it wants to sync during each run, randomly, which causes card selection to hang.

time, Second, Dont get me wrong, this game is amazing. But this port is rubbish. Second time I've had to uninstall it because it keeps freezing at the start screen. Unless you have the patience to make it work, you're in for a rough time. I, unfortunately, do have the patience. Mostly because this game is amazing. But that should still stop you!!

mode, offline, I love this game so much on PC, but the Android port has a lot of issues. There's no offline mode, and syncing takes way, way too long when either loading the game initially or when a run ends. Selecting cards to play can sometimes be a bit finicky too. A fully offline mode would make this a 5/5 mobile game, but the massive delays with syncing data make this tough to recommend

port, Horrible, Horrible mobile port of the PC game and wipes all you progress if you played offline the previous session. Spent a few hours unlocking all characters only for it to sync with google play the next time I opened game and everything was locked again.

builder, best, The best deck builder on the market (arguably one of the greatest) Only frustration is it's frequent crashing on victory screen. Hoping it will be patched out soon.

game, addictive, A very addictive and well made game. Lots of fun to be had, quick and intuitive controls. The game runs smoothly, and I haven't experienced the long synchronising issues others have reported. I have come to write a review after saving and exiting the game, coming back to it 5 minutes later to find that I have gone back a couple runs which meant a few hours worth of gaming has just disappeared. This just isn't acceptable in a game charging £8.99, which is why 2 stars deducted. P30 Pro.

load, first, Cannot turn sync off. Wait 30 seconds on first load. Lose hours of progress the next time you boot up. Fantastic game though Update: Game freezes on winning/losing, sometimes I get two wins because it resets me to right before the victory screen, sometimes I win and the run just vanishes! Sync!

game, Great, Great game, however the syncing issues are present, I was really disappointed when it deleted my save file just when I had all characters unlocked. I'm going back to the switch version

game, great, Mediocre port, great game. We all know slay the spire is great, but this isn't a good port. It's the exact same UI as on PC and the touch controls really don't work that well with it. Prepare for TONS of mis-inputs. Be very careful scrolling thru cards if you need to make a selection as the scrolling often gets misinterpreted as a selection. Pretty frustrating that they didn't learn anything from the switch port. It had the exact same touch control issues.

issues, syncing, I loved it on Switch so I got it for Android, but it has a lot of syncing issues. The game often freezes when I either die or beat the game, and I lose my progress in the process. This happens too often and if it doesn't get fixed, I would like a refund.
rougelike, single, Literally every single "deck building rougelike" is a clone or some form of a copy of this game. This game is the O.G. of deckbuilders in a rougelike format and is on steam and almost all of the other platforms maybe besides the switch. However many consoles it drops on doesnt matter; because i buy it on every platform i can. Its way worth the money, and id be surprised if this didnt appeal to you. It does have some issues with annoying touch functionality so a patch for controllers is needed!!!

cards, new, Pretty much the exact same as the PC version. Only trouble I had was that when viewing new cards to add to your deck I wasn't sure how to check the upgrade. But the PC version has that feature.
progress, run, I have over 800 hours in the PC version of this game. Needless to say, I really like it. The reason I'm giving this port 4/5 stars is because of the number of times this game has completely deleted my run progress after I close and reopen it. Sometimes it crashes and there goes my perfect run. Maybe it's just my device, but that sort of thing should just never happen. I mean come on I had 3 upgraded aparitions :(

screen, syncing, The game constantly hangs and goes unresponsive when you're loading in given the "syncing data" screen. It's a gamble if it's actually going to open, give you a black screen, or crash. No restarts, or even reinstallations of the game have fixed this issue. Now when I redownload it from the play store, the game tries to download the rest of it's data from within the application. Except it just crashes every time. The app is completely unusable. Devs really need to fix the game. 0/5 as is.

games, Other, Bought bc I enjoyed on Switch, but super frustrating to see how poor of a port this is. Touch controls are wonky, and even with clicking to save before closing the app runs are often lost. Other card games that followed in the path Slay the Spire made are able to handle these basics with ease. Why not this one?
issues, bigger, The game itself is great. The port however isn't. The UI is the same as in PC so everything is quite small. But it has much bigger issues as well. The game freezes often freezing the whole phone in the process. Consistently freezes on "syncing data" and after killing a boss or dying.

game, amazing, This is an amazing game that has become trash due to and awful user interface. I LOVED this game on steam on PC. But due to the current unfriendly interface, which makes me constantly play cards unintentionally, even when I'm being carefully....makes this game unplayable. I want a refund. I feel like I got screwed over.

port, mediocre, A mediocre port. Enemy sprites sometimes don't show up. Syncing is slow. Touch controls are horrible. It is especially difficult to deselect a card, which leads to a LOT of misplayed cards. Event choice buttons are too small, leading to frequent misclicks. I would have given a 1-star rating were it not for this game being one of my favorite games.

platform, other, Straight to the point okay here we go 1. The game is just like how it is on every other platform. 2. There are a few slight changes for optimization. little subtle differences that do not change the gameplay whatsoever. And it's just from what I've noticed slightly less or no animation on small things. 3. The controls can be a little wonky just like everyone else said but I'm sure that we'll get better in due time with a patch hopefully. Does it really hinder the gameplay? No,no it does not.

skill, biggest, Unfair, unbalance garbage game. Enemies rapidly accelerate at a pace you can't possible be expected to match. As a rogue lite it's expected to be difficult but the biggest skill involved is your ability to get good cards which are randomly doled out. By the end of the second level enemies are healing, block, and hitting for 40 per turn all in 1 turn. Waste of 13 bucks.

games, due, This game spawned a hundred clones. A testament to its quality. However, I gave the phone port 4 stars. This is because it contains some interface problems. I've lost games due to occasional misclicks. The two main issues are; + Buttons are too small. + The card selection and targeting system is too imprecise. Also it has too many ways of selecting options. Fixes; + Remove the hand that shifts and use arrows either side instead. + Toggle drag and drop. + Clear place to deselect card.

app, best, This is probably the best app you could have on your phone
cardbuilder, first, I can't convey just how much I enjoy this game and that it's not pay to win! This is the first cardbuilder I've gotten into and I have sunk about 20 hours into it this far. 100% worth the money. (Slay the Spire came recommended from a friend)
screens, certain, Currently the controls make it difficult to switch between cards in combat. It can be a little slow to load certain screens sometimes, and certain UI popups can be a little small, but overall it's about as fun as the PC version so far.

game, previous, Half the time I try to continue a game, all of my progress is lost and I'm inserted into the middle of a previous game; sometimes two or three games back.
issues, mild, Love the game. Just came to say that lately I have been having mild sync issues. I'll close the app part way through one game and when I open it to continue it'll sometimes load part way through a previous run.

times, few, 10 dollars for it to crash every time I beat the end boss ... into crashing every few times when I re-launch the game. :/ it's a good rouge like game but the crashing hinders the game experience. Waste of money to buy mobile, would stick to pc.

days, first, It was playing fine for first 3 days.. now stuck on synching data
crashes, many, Love the game, but having so many crashes/not responding at the end of runs. Also lots of times syncing causes issues and lose game on progress. Hope a fix soon.
pile, draw, Touchscreen controls need a lot of work. Very hard to select your draw pile etc or to select your cards properly. Straight forward port from PC with no consideration to new touchscreen environment on mobiles.

runs, whole, Fun game, although the save system needs work, as it regularly loses progress and sometimes forgets whole runs when its booted up.
time, 5th, Played it 5 times through. Little sad that I beat the game after the 5th time as this seems a bit too easy (I may have just gotten very lucky so can forgive this). Mostly though, I am annoyed that the game will no longer open and infinitetly says 'syncing' so I can't even get back ointo the game to unlock more things. I think a refund is in order as I have now paid nearly £10 for something that won't open. Just to add - the controls are atrocious and a glitchy mess as well. It was playable like this but I can't recommend this game to mobile players.

downside, only, Well, the PC game is awesome and the port to mobile is well executed, the only downside I have is some syncing with the cloud problems (i.e. Game tends to get stuck while syncing and it tends to freeze sometime, mostly while syncing), being able to disable auto syncing would be nice
runs, multiple, Game is having issues syncing game data. I've had to refinish multiple runs. I'll tap past the credits and then once I'm on the main menu it gives me the option to "continue" again which puts me back at the credits to finish the run. I've even finished a run and had the game put me back a couple fights before the final boss after hitting continue again.

times, numerous, The game itself is fantastic. The data syncing is atrocious. It has wiped my save file numerous times and even syncing from Google Play doesn't work consistently. I cannot keep restarting. BUT the game is absolutely worth the money even just to play through a few times. Very frustrating to have it reset again and again though.

port, ok, Just an ok port of this otherwise good game. It desperately needs a UI overhaul: an improved card selection system and a bigger size in cards and general text are the main aspects I'd like to see revised. I'm playing on a Oneplus 8 and eye strain is considerable.

port, great, Not a fan that you always have to wait for the game to sync to the cloud. Could've been a great port if it wasn't for this.
game, Good, Good game, but very bad port. Handles like it was being emulated instead of actually being on a phone. There are no ui changes, and some options are missing?

card, deep, Still the same great, deep card game from the PC space. Perfect for mobile as you can pop it, climb some floor and then put it aside for another time. The BEST mobile game by FAR. My only gripe with it is that the initial load is a bit lengthy and the control can be clunky (you'll get use to it though). Get this!

run, entire, Truly difficult and challenging. The difficulty allows the need to actively engage your mind and make decision that impact the entire run. Great game and very glad it came to mobile!

times, mentioned, The game is great, but as mentioned before(several times) the port sucks. You'll definitely have issues more than half the time opening the app.
complaint, only, My only complaint is that I can't give this game more stars. Thank you StS for yet another addiction I didn't need. Why get hooked on drugs when there's another run through the Spire to be made?

game, Good, Good game, buggy port. Sometimes it crashes or freezes when dying or abandoning a run. I've run into cards becoming invisible every once in a while. My scores don't show up on the daily leaderboards. Takes forever for data to sync on the title screen.

problems, same, I own this game on PC so I love it and know it's great, but it simply doesn't work on my pixel, and from what I've read, it has the same problems with android as well. You play for a bit, and despite the difficulty deselecting cards, it works fine. But after I completed my second run, the game froze and crashed, and when I went to play it got stuck on the loading screen saying "syncing data". I uninstalled and reinstalled, which reset my save, only for the same thing to happen next run.

fiddly, little, I'm not much for card games. I'm not much for roguelites. Yet somehow, somehow I can get lost in this game for hours and hours. It's fantastic no matter where you're playing it. That said, the touch controls can ve a little fiddly at times.
menu, main, Cant get past the main menu. Freezes when trying to add the name. Have restarted and tried 4 times, please refund.
games, complex, If you like roguelikes or complex card games, then this game is easily worth the price of admission. As for the quality of the mobile port, while it can take a little bit to load and the cards can be a bit tricky to select from time to time, these are pretty easy to get used to and the accessibility and portability make this version easily worth it if you simply want to play the game on your phone. Wpuld recommend.

week, last, I really love the game, but it's been glitching badly since the middle of last week. It won't load the daily challenges, and it won't synch with my devices. (I've tried it on several, one running Android 10, another running Android 11. Same thing on both.) I am going to have to switch to the PC version until multiple issues are fixed. It seems like a *lot* of players are having problems. I knocked 2 stars off my rating here, due to multiple problems.

experience, new, Amazing! Every run is a new experience with you having to improvise and adapt your play style based on what's available to you; be that cards, relics, or potions. One second you feel like a bad arse, the next you barely cheese out a win or get yours handed to you. Knowing that you are not likely to win makes this a great solitaire game that you can get better or worse runs each attempt.

boss, final, Love this game and cannot recommend it enough, but there are some issues with this port and saving. I'll save and quit after fighting boss and when I load I'm fighting the enemy I faced before the boss again... I've had runs I've finished that I can continue from an enemy before the final boss. Deselecting cards could use a little work as well. This is a 5* game and I would love for that to reflect in my rating when these issues are fixed.

I'll save and quit after fighting boss and when I load I'm fighting the enemy I faced before the boss again... I've had runs I've finished that I can continue from an enemy before the final boss. Deselecting cards could use a little work as well. This is a 5* game and I would love for that to reflect in my rating when these issues are fixed.
versions, other, The game is very good but the port can be frustrating. It's difficult to deselect cards & it won't be uncommon for you to unintentionally play a card because the game has it highlighted while you were trying to click something else. If you enjoy the game on other versions then this one is still fun, but it's not a replacement.
run, last, Had issues with syncing for some reason and when i loaded it back up i lost 2 months worth of play along with achievements i earned along the way. Gutting, the game thinks my last run was april 2nd
game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, somewhat steep learning curve but a good way to sink in 100's of hours quite easily.
curve, steep, Fantastic game, somewhat steep learning curve but a good way to sink in 100's of hours quite easily.

battlers, modern, The port itself is mediocre, not very polished, but playable. The game is archaic, compared to modern card battlers.
game, Great, Was looking for a card game, have been trying out a lot of games, but only Slay the spire was the best out there. The comments about the controls being clunky is let's say a bit 1/4 true. You'd still enjoy the game and you will get use to the controls, but, yes they can pretty much optimise it more that is why for now 4/5. Great game!
game, best, The best game on android, worth the price.
game, great, It's a great game, but if I exit the application after saving a run and then reopen it there's no "continue" option. I have to start a new run each time... Basically none of my progress is saved unless I sit down for over an hour to finish a run without exiting the app

game, Great, Great game. Controls are pretty poor though
way, better, Desperately needs a better way to deselect cards without accidentally using them. Great game.

kinks, few, I'm so happy to finally get a version of this game on mobile. Very good overall, though a few kinks need worked out like the medical kit relic not actually allowing "unplayable" cards to be played, as well as some issues with choosing cards in the hand to play. It's somewhat clumsy on my phone (Samsung J7) though I would expect that to be easier to deal with on a larger screen.

gripe, only, This game is adapted perfectly to Android and touch controls. My only gripe is that often the action of dragging your cards up from the bottom of the screen often also triggers the Android function to return to the home screen.
game, Great, Great game! I really love it but i have a problem with my save file, something is causing my run to delete its self, it happens when i exit the game, when I return the run I was in, its gone! So to be sure i have to complete the entire game to finish it! I would give 5 stars even with this bug/problem (and i did), but i cant play it like this its frustating so i hope something will happen.

port, mobile, I love Slay the Spire and played about 100 hours on PC. I've played ~10 hours on mobile and lost 4 save files. This is very frustrating to encounter in a $10 mobile port.
complaint, only, Loved it on pc, love it on android. My only complaint would be that when you have a full hand of cards, sometimes selecting the correct card gets fuzzy.

problem, Only, Been waiting for this to hit mobile to play, and it's sooo good. Master class in the genre. Only problem is it doesn't keep my saved runs if I go a few hours without loading the game despite hitting save and exit. My progress is saved in unlocks, but not the run :(

game, Great, Great game, lost my data when I bought a tablet. For whatever reason the game decided not to sync my data to the tablet, then synced it FROM the tablet to my phone. My unlocks are gone, my account is gone, all my hours just gone. I've lost all desire to keep playing at this point, I refuse to get back to Ascension because the app screwed up. Would've rated it 5 stars previously, but wow.
systems, different, Own it one 3 different systems and play on all of them. Love the card synergy and the RNG is pretty fair

reviews, exaggerated, Extremely over exaggerated negative reviews about controls. The controls are fine, I've played this game for about 80 hours and I can say I've only misplayed a card handful of times. If you like the game or are interested in it, don't let the reviews about the controls make the decision for you.

time, ridiculous, I quite like the game but the "syncing" is definitely broken. Not only it takes ridiculous time but a lot of times it does not work - my acsencion level unlocks fail to actually unlock 20% of time, making progression frustrating.
time, Great, Great time killing game. The data syncing, crashing and sticky cards are notable issues. Cards can easily be unintentionally selected and played if you're trying to play fast. The game syncs often, so if you have a poor internet connection, it can cause issues. The game crashes at transitions often, but the natural autosaving feature of the game, plus seeded gameplay means that getting back to where you were, at most 1 fight before, is no big deal. Still a 5/5, despite the issues.

battle, single, Fun game. Really good for plane rides, but the length of a single battle fits into the typical time constraints mobile gaming is good for (coffee breaks, waiting for the bus). Beating the game isn't too challenging, but there's 20 levels of difficulty that you can unlock. This is nice because there's a lot of roguelikes where beating the game is a Herculean task; here beating the game at maximum difficulty is a real challenge but weaker players can still enjoy some satisfaction.

thing, only, I've put time into this game on PC and now mobile. I have Tha Note 20 Ultra so my phone is big enough that the cards aren't too small and I can use a stylus when selecting cards I think the only thing I can find wrong with the mobile version is that you can't view upgraded versions of cards before you buy them or when choosing them after a fight. If the devs were to add like a long click or something to allow that it would awesome. My favorite game on mobile. Buy it.

cards, Deselecting, This is like a 4.5 star game with 1 star controls. Deselecting cards is too difficult. Potions as well. You'll accidentally select cards as rewards when you really are just trying to figure out what a keyword in it means. I don't have enough space to describe the tricks of getting around such flaws, you'll just have to learn yourself and no doubt screw up numerous runs in the process Beyond that, it's a lovely roguelike game with a great aesthetic and huge replayability.

game, great, Slay the Spire in itself is a great game, but on the phone it's clanky and hard to move cards, maybe it's me but I like being able to swipe a card in one fluid motion and that's difficult if not impossible here, it's also only in landscape mode which isn't bad but I think there could be fun to be had in portrait mode

reviews, negative, I was skeptical on getting this with the negative reviews on controls but it feels like people are overly exaggerating. It does take awhile to sync which is annoying but the game plays pretty much like its PC counterpart. I've done maybe 9 runs and have only played the wrong card 2-3 times... I'd say any control issues would be from screen size and fat fingers anyways. Playing on S10+

hassle, true, Look. The game is really good. But the touch controls are simply infuriating. Things keep selected after you release them and switching between cards and targeting them is a true hassle. I just can't recommend this until these are fixed. edit: As clunky as it is, you get used to it. Great game, even considering the terrible port.

experience, amazing, An amazing rogue-like experience that I'd put up there with games like Hades and Enter the Gungeon. There's a bit of luck and careful preparation needed with each run, but it's very satisfying when you get a hand that stun-locks enemies and lets you beat their families into submission. 11/10.

port, Great, Great port for the most part. Sometimes selecting a card can be difficult and I've had some minor lag when playing on tablet. Other then that, it's a great way to play on the go.

controls, clumsy, I had previously reviewed this game, but decided it was still too complimentary. Do NOT buy this game. It is BROKEN. Forget the clumsy controls. Forget the extra long boot up time. You will completely lose hours upon hours of your life to this game, not from playing it, but from your game not loading properly. It happens CONSTANTLY. To not have any local backup is insanity. Slay the Spire is one of my favorite games ever but this version will frustrate you more than anything. DO NOT BUY.

runs, few, Love the game but have to agree with the comments. The devs need to fix the slipperiness of the controls. Cost me a few runs already. It can be very frustrating.
game, best, The best mobile game in existence, hands down. No ads, no in app purchases, just an amazing game worth 30 dollars. A steal at 10.

thing, only, The only thing I can think of to improve is to have a confirm button when clicking on a relic/key fragment in a chest and an easier way to see card upgrades

games, favorite, Before reading any further.. I'm using a Samsung S21+ at the moment to play this. First off I have to say this is one of my all time favorite games on pc and have dumped copious hours into it. I gotta say this mobile version is pretty much exactly what you would expect. Its the same game essentially just with touch screen, and I've been seeing a lot of control complaints in the reviews about the controls but I just completed my first run with not a single issue. I highly recommend this game! 👍

thing, only, Its on mobile now!!! SWEET!!!! I love the game, I made this a 4 star ONLY because I do not have my Mod the Spire, please note I do not think this game deserves anything less than a 5 star rating. By no means am I complaining of the game. But as a customer, I will always want MOREEE. So I hope mods come eventually! In reality the game is awesome. It is just like your card slinging app on Steam (or wherever you got it). The only small thing is cards tend to not de-select, causing uou to play them

reviews, other, Agree with other reviews. Game is awesome, hits all the right feels, but the way the cards stick out in your hand when you're trying to preview them makes it so you misplay so many times. It didn't really bother me until it literally cost me the final fight. Should be an easy UI fix

controls, worse, It's fine. Basically the PC version with worse controls, buggy saving and ascension levels that don't work.
game, Best, Best game ever. Relic/card interactions are weird at first to learn but their behavior is very consistent. Game is difficult but very rewarding to play and complete. Overall 10/10.
roguelike, fun, Very fun deck-building roguelike, has everything that's on the PC version. Controls are kinda bad, but if you get used to them, you understand their quirks. Controls still should be improved though.
games, favorite, This is one of my all time favorite games and I am so happy to be able to play it on mobile. I only have one problem with this port and that's that the game crashes after completing a run pretty often making it impossible to progress. That doesn't make me not like it though I'm sure you guys will fix this soon. Thanks for the great game.

platform, mobile, For being a 10$ app purchase it really fails to deliver on a mobile platform. The cards are difficult to choose and the game feels clunky to play. You can tell it was made for PC and converted as an after thought. It's not that slay the spire is a bad game. It's just a terrible mobile port and there are significantly better and more mobile apt rogue like deck builders in the market. Will update if changes are made

game, great, Played the game on PC, great game and fun. The controls are a little wonky, but it's not too bad. Don't let other reviews discourage you, try it.

game, fun, Really fun game that has been converted expertly to mobile. The controls take a bit of getting used to but once you've got them down it's barely noticeable.
time, long, The game itself is great, but takes an awfully long time to sync. It also has a habit of freezing on death.
cards, different, As others have mentioned, the game is amazing but the port needs work. The cards are not easily selectable, and once selected, it is difficult to change to different cards.
game, Great, Exactly like the PC game, so it is almost perfect. Great game. The touch controls are the tiniest bit dodgy at times, but other than that, it's fantastic. Worth $10 easy.

hopes, high, I had high hopes for this game. I was doing my research on whether to buy it for the Switch on my phone. I decided to buy it for the phone. Much of what people said regarding the touch controls is partially true. It can be a bit difficult to use the touch controls, but not much of a big deal. Very playable. The reason I'm rating it two stars is because literally after 48 minutes of gameplay it doesn't even let me load the game anymore. The cloud save isn't working. It gets stuck on the sync..

issues, significant, Slay the spire is a brilliant game - well balanced, addictive and replayable. The port however has significant issues. Run progress saves inconsistently and I've lost several autosave files in the sync at startup. The controls are a bit fiddly as well so it's easy to select incorrect cards at times, which is a big problem in a roguelite. The support has also been lacking as these issues have existed since launch. A couple of fixes are needed to give this game the port it deserves.

game, Awesome, Awesome game, but the mobile version is a little clunky. 7/10 in comparison of smoothness to the PC version, BUT, 5 stars cause its still ENTIRELY fine to play, but the cards can be a tad sticky.

side, right, I love the game and have done since playing on pc. I'm having issues with screen ratio however. Everything on the right hand side is just off screen so I can't press it. Hoping this is fixed soon.
game, amazing, Slay the Spire is an amazing game, but unfortunately, the controls in the mobile version are abysmal. It seems like your "taps" on the screen are just emulating a mouse cursor, which leads to some really annoying moments - card previews blocking half the screen, accidentally playing cards when you don't mean to, not being able to view upgrades for cards when adding them to your deck... Very clunky overall. If the controls are improved, I'll gladly change this to a 5-star review.

effort, little, As many have said, the base game is great, but very little effort has been put into porting it to mobile devices. My biggest gripe is how small everything is, especially the text. Hearthstone does it better.

time, other, Requires internet access to play the game, and yet every other time I go to load, my save is lost. Not just some progress is lost, the entire run is gone. Insane that they think this kind of system will discourage pirating. Haven't downloaded a game from the play store in many years, probably never will again. I've never lost a save using emulators.

reviews, Most, Most reviews dont truly reflect the games experience. Most negative reviews are people rushing the game and trying to just complete it while on the toilet. The controls while not perfect, are far better than some others I have encountered on other games. The bugs are minimal, a few errors here and there, but the developers are still patching bugs. Gameplay is fairly repeatable, since its rabdomly generated each playthrough, with scalable difficulty. Deffinetely recommend if you love crawlers.

game, Excellent, Excellent game very well done ty for bringing it to mobile! Only issue for me is when you win a run sometimes it doesn't count towards ascension
set, right, Already put over 20 hours on PC. Building the right set and experimenting with different builds is always very fun! Can't recommend this game enough for people who love other deck building games.

release, first, Massively improved since first release. Now almost no bugs.Only issue is that it can be really hard to change which card is selected and it keeps trying to play to same card rather than change selection. Other than that this is a brilliant version of the best solo deckbuilder.

hours, many, I have so many hours in the pc version of this game, and I adore it. Slay the Spire is easily one of my all time top 10 games, and believe me, I've played a ton of games. However, the mobile versions controls are in fact, abysmal. In some cases and situations almost unplayable or even unfair. I really, really want to give this game 5 stars and while it is a favorite game of mine, the current handling of cards in hand and selection in a few menus almost makes 3 stars feel generous. 5 stars if fix

game, Best, Best game!
ascension, next, The game is phenomenal! But the interface needs work for mobile. I've noticed that the next ascension doesn't always unlock when beating the third boss. I move on to another character and by the time I get back to the first the ascension has unlocked. The "Syncing Data" could be less obtrusive.

games, best, One of the best deck building games out there. So happy it's on mobile!
version, upgraded, UI needs work; cards don't move as expected and I couldn't figure out how to view a card's upgraded version
gud, Pretty, Pretty gud
time, incredible, Other than some misclicks and it taking a while to sync between 2 devices I've had an incredible time and I couldn't reccomend it more!
game, Good, Good game had fun playing There is one problem i cant progress my ascension. I gave 1-3-2-0 ascension levels on my characters respectively but i cannot ascned anymore even when i beat the game and the heart multiple times. Please tell me a fix about this. Thank you

game, Great, Great game but it has a small problem. Card selection (and some others) are hard to tap on or you have to tap on it repeatedly to select them

game, Best, Best card game ever made
cards, wrong, The interface kinda sux often play the wrong cards unintended
review, Updated, Updated review. Still love the game, very addicting. However, some of the enemies hit way too hard! The consistent damage they deal out is too high. You can have a great run with good cards and good relics just to be stopped by an overpowered elite battle. I understand the challenge but it gets frustrating sometimes.

version, mobile, The game itself it great, but the mobile version needs some work. Often very difficult to select a card, and more frustratingly, even worse to deselect a card accidentally selected without playing it. The save/autosave is terrible and does not work most of the time. If you are unable to play an entire game start to finish, don't get your hopes being able to resume the game at a later time after saving/exiting. For $9.99 I would have hoped it to be more playable.

cards, correct, The game is fun but the fact that I cannot select the correct cards is incredibly annoying. Also, keeping the bottom half of the card off screen is pretty dumb. I dont know how this is not priority number 1 in updates to fix this.

game, Great, Great game. I've been getting a bug while fighting bosses where the screen will flash white for a few seconds and glitch out. This is on a Pixel 2 XL Edit: bugs fixed - 5/5
controls, better, Playing on my Z Fold 2 is a joy. Prefer this version to the switch version due to better controls. If you have a big screened android device, you'll love this game!

game, Great, Great game, I have it on PC too and that version I'd easily give 5 stars. I can't do that with this version until the controls are fixed. I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally played the wrong card when trying to select a different one all because of the weird sticky controls. I don't know how they managed to make a card game difficult to control but I'll be darned if they didn't find a way. If/when that gets fixed I'll bump this up to five stars since it's still a phenomenal game.

boss, first, Razer Phone 2, game crashes every time I choose reward after first boss. It's unplayable, please refund or fix ASAP.
game, Great, Great game

reason, odd, The game itself seems to run decently, tough if i rotate my phone 180 degrees the app itself seems to crash for some odd reason.
work, hard, Crashes when trying to play Daily Run. thank you for your hard work!
choices, more, Its fun, but id like more character choices or atleast mod capabilities so other people can create characters like The guardian for the PC version.

reviews, other, As I saw mentioned in the other reviews it can be a little finicky with selecting cards and it can be hard to select potions. It is still the same great game though. Addictive, fun and just the right level of frustrating.

game, amazing, Absolutely amazing game, one of the most addictive and well balanced card roguelikes out there (and on of the most fun) Only minor gripes with the size of text, but I don't think that completely detracts from enjoying the game. Would be amazing to have a portrait orientation but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one.

game, Phenomenal, Phenomenal game and true to the PC version which I've sunk many hours into. Truly a game with unlimited replayability. Great to play on the plane or on the go. Occasional bugs as this just released but still usable and I'm sure these will be worked out.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, its very addicting (which can be a negative) and provides opportunities to develop very satisfying combos. I can see myself playing this for years to come. I was initially waned by the few negative reviews for this Android port, and whilst there may be some minor issues with control, I wouldn't let them put you off your purchase. Would buy again 10/10

game, Awesome, Awesome game. Not a fan of card games, but this game had hooked me up. Can't believe my first trial run was 45 mins length. It's one hell of a ride.

games, many, Sts is great and inspiration for many many games and while the phone controls are clunky, there are some graphical glitches, and I wish i could change how large the ui is I can see past it all beacuse its just a really good game. Edit: I did not have any issues saving my game, I have a samsung.
