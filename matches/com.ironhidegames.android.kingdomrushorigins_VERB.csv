play, for, fans, Best in the series. A must play for tower defense fans.

got, in, phone, First game that I've got in my first android phone. Now I bought this game to feel the nostalgia again..
spent, on, game, Great game for the phone. I spent a lot time on this game, time i should have used better.
get, with, combo, This game need somw serious rebalance the archer upgrades are so strong that you get by with basically archer+barrack combo… the druid towers are the least useful as it start off weak, and most of the horde type minions has at least higher health or lite armor the splash damage dont make sense, the ones that are weak to physical damage also has such high health the slow and splash mechanics is basically useless…
doing, in, life, If you haven't played any Kingdom's Rush game, you're doing something wrong in your life
pay, for, game, Love the series. Would've had a higher rating if it weren't for the money grab. You pay for the game and just get the basics even if you grind really hard it'll take forever to purchase a top rank champion. I paid for the entire game let me experience the entire game.

Reminds, of, guy, Another great installment in a great franchise. I'm using the tree hero and he's seems pretty strong. Reminds me of the bear guy from the first one.

live, to, expectations, Ah, I really wanted to like this game, but... it just wasn't my taste :/ I loved the original Kingdom Rush, so I'm pretty sad that this one didn't live up to my expectations. For some reason, the colours seem too garish, the stage layouts often look cluttered & confusing, and I'm not a huge fan of the towers in this version. But the dealbreaker for me has to be the amount of spiders 😭 The original had spiders too, but as an arachnophobe, the Mactans level was a nightmare. Couldn't finish it 😭

paying, to, download, It seems every kingdom Rush game on Android is the same you only get half the experience after paying to download, the rest is locked via 60$+ to get the full experience the game itself is fun but this is not good for the consumer

max, in, waves, KR series aren't fun at all. It's all about founding the right tower setup. You can't max upgrade your towers, just one or two in the last few waves. It's like they give us a machine gun with just 5 bullets. This is not a hard game, if you want to beat it just search for the right setup for each round. You won't have the ability to play with strategies, you will have to find THE ONE strategy and that's it.

looking, for, challenge, supper fun, small game to pass the time. it can be easy or difficult to fit your mood of either killing time or looking for a real challenge. great mechanics. my only issue is since im using chrome book and an android app. i dont have any hot keys so i have to scroll but i am still able to beat all of Kingdom Rush on normal (3 stars) and challenges so it has really hinderd my fun with the game.

thought, Of, games, Of all the kingdom rush games, i never thought this would be my favorite. Lilith does so good in combat
Played, in, past, One of my favourite games ever. Played it in the past, now I am playing it again. Never gets old.
keep, with, influx, Honestly I have loved playing kingdom rush. I just feel disappointed that at the extra levels they are too hard because I have only one hero so I can't keep up with the influx of enemies, my hero Mr A is tired from running to and frow! Anyways thank you for such a quality game, that is the only reason I rate it 4 stars.

add, to, press, Great game but didn't like the addition of environmentals, all they did was add buttons to press while making the game feel a little more shallow
look, up, solution, Suffers from the same problem as most TD games; fail or restart levels repeatedly until you find the "correct" tower placement or look up the solution.
crashes, on, time, The game crashes on the first time I get 'only counts as one' achievement.
engaged, in, game, Good challenging fun, Have to stay engaged in the game or you will be overrun
crashed, on, Neverwonder, Just came here to say I crashed twice on lvl 10 Neverwonder. Oh, and I like the game.
replay, through, four, I love all the kingdom rush games, have since i found them freshman year. I replay through all four every six months or so. After about the fourth time doing this, i went through on black Friday and bought all of the heroes/towers in most of the games, but i left out origins for some reason. I wanted to buy the full hero pack, but haven't gotten any offers in the last couple weeks, even though I've checked every day. Is there any way i could gain access to that offer so i can support more?

excells, at, dps, This is the wierdest kingdom rush, mages that fires 2 per shot, a MAGE that fires very fast but excells at single target dps, artillery that can stack 3 shots like the archmage and summons units, bladesingers that both excells at dealing damage and tanking despite its looks. Forest keepers which is only 2 units but is actually a support tower. Despite all of it its still high quality, i REALLY wonder where are the others in origins like blackburn, nivus, and the rest of the heroes in the series?

have, With, pass, In order to enjoy this game. You need the Google play pass. Because this version is miles harder than the other versions. With the pass you just have to grind and get upgrades because you will NEVER finish the harder levels without them. It's not possible and the developers know this. NOW... If you don't have the pass? STAY AWAY from this game at all costs! You will need to spend HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of dollars to complete this game on the harder levels. Pure BS GARBAGE. A money pit🖕🏿

did, for, PC, Great game, great series. In-app purchases ruin it though. Devs responded insisting it's balanced. In-app purchases inherently shift the balance of games to make them infuriating to play unless you pay up. Ironshide, please create an Android version without in-app purchases like you did for PC.
having, with, engine, Love this game. If you need help building levels let me now. I can see myself having alot of fun with your game engine and building wave after wave of fun!

played, for, year, I've played for a year. This is one of the best mobile games! Donated for supporting.
stuck, in, level, It's a very good game, but I put 4 stars because if you're a noob on the game, there's not any way to get better, so u get stuck in a level and u can't continue
played, in, time, The kingdom rush series are the best mobile games I've played in a long time.
Fun, for, family, Fun for the whole family )
pay, for, anything-, Great tower defense strategy game. No need to pay for anything- sometimes need to use the strategy guide and play all aspects of each level but you can do it all. I want more of them!
introduced, in, story, Great game but new heroes should be introduced in the campaign story before they become available for purchase. Or alternatively buying new heroes should open up more campaign content made for the heroes. Over all a great game. Keep the game alive ironhide.

compared, to, masterpiece, Kingdom Rush Vengeance is a greedy cash grab compared to this masterpiece
exist, in, PlayStore, It's one of the best games that exist in the PlayStore. I started out by playing Kingdom Rush, the free version. And I realized that the whole saga is worth buying. Also my congratulations for the developers, the game has very cute and cool graphics. It's an excellent game!
Thank, for, addiction, I spent a considerable amount of time playing these games growing up. Now I spend a concerning amount of time playing them now. Thank you for the most pleasant addiction.
gets, with, game, Just. Amazing, the kingdom rush franchise just gets better and better with each game (besides vengence) just like frontiers and normal ol' kingdom rush this delivers quite as well, if not better. Ironhide has a place in my heart as some of the best flash games I played back in the day and I can only hope they get better.

Reminds, of, plants, Very fun and challenging!! Reminds me of plants vs zombies, very fun game!!
carried, on, line, Fantastic game and carried on the kingdom rush line well
hooked, on, game, the game is addictive. i sought medical advice. The advice was that the medical professional was hooked on this game too, so advised to keep playing the saga
goes, for, games, Love the selection of hero's, same goes for all the KR games. They're very interesting and diverse. Wilbur is OP!
did, on, story, Just finished this game, what a great find! Devs did a great job on both story & game play, 5 stars :)
use, with, tons, The whole series is an absolute blast to play. Easily one of the most amazing and well made tower defence games out there. Each game has a distinct feel. There is replayability with difficulty increases and always an epic sense of accomplishment with each siege successfully defended. Multiple heroes to use (or buy) with tons of unique enemies. Great animations and slick graphics. Can keep you busy for hours.
messed, on, level, Great game as always the hyenas messed me up on the 3rd level tho
Love, from, start, Love the gameplay from the very start. Not just a tower defense, it also has RPG element and very attractive unit&hero development. And I won the game without buying any diamond. So, for the one who said it's a pay for win game, maybe you just need to hone your skill.

came, across, game, Hello Ironhide I don't know if you'll see this but I just wanted to say you people are Flippin awesome I've been playing this game since I was five.The first time I came across this game was in the public library I saw my brother playing this on the public computer boy did I fall in love with the game 6 years and I'm still playing second thing I want to point out the special offers in this game are absolutely crazy I got two ridiculous offers in ten minutes anyways this game gets1,000,000/10 :)

compared, to, rushes, Best game of the series imo. Pros: -Way more free heroes than in original game, -Graphics are definitely improved compared to other Kingdom rushes, -Very unique enemies, -Some actual story, -Great map events. Cons: -Isn't free (and this is a big con since it is a mobile game) -Doesn't take too long to finish a game. Even though there are challenges they're basically the same level with harder difficulty. Overall I'd rate this game 8/10
completed, within, week, I really wish y'all could update your games. This game is so much fun, but more worlds, more places, more side stories and art. More super powerful bosses. It's always so fun and it's challenging. There's a fair upgrade system and little Easter eggs, achievements, and great artwork. My only complaint is how short this game is. The levels can be completed within a week and it's disheartening to see it just finish. I know it needs to have a finish line, but the finish line is so close to the start
paid, for, Hero, What the hell!! I want my money back i literally paid for Faustus Hero and in-app purchased it ! My money was deducted from my account but i did not get my hero , either give me the character or refund please ,

work, on, tablet, All Kingdom Rush games do not work on my android tablet, i get a error saying no code to run, the game may be packaged incorrectly.
wait, for, Vengeance, Great game, character have they own unique skill. More challenging for most of Kr version, but still good 👍. Can't wait for Kr Vengeance after finished all stage 😉
revisiting, with, difficulty, This is an excellent tower defense game. No ads, no pay to win, no annoying popups. Extremely cheap, definitely worth the money. Else you can just play thenoriginal which is free, without ads. You can easily sink 10+ hours enjoying. It doesn't really feel worth revisiting levels with highest difficulty. Maybe that can be improved in future games. Solid 9/10.

have, on, phone, Even better than the first. It's bigger, prettier, and the strategy of which towers to use and when is mixed up a good amount to keep it fresh and new. If you were only to have one game on your phone, this is it.
need, on, phone, Even better than kingdom rush These are the only two games you need on your phone
have, for, fan, I love every game in the Kingdom Rush series. They are all worth playing. The game still holds up. A must have for a TD fan.
play, like, game, This is my 2nd favorite Kindom Rush game from Iron hide. Really fun to play like every other kindom rush game. They should have added more game themes like snow or something. You can look at the the enimes from a book in the game and look what they can do and how much heath they have which is unique. And you can spend your stars to get upgrades for your guys.

makes, for, me, This is the first Kingdom Rush I played that I actually stopped playing and deleted it. Who thought it was a good idea to have levels change up the path halfway through? Or allow people to go other routes of nowhere? I get you're trying to make it different but for me personally this makes the gameplay infuriating and not fun. I worked for 12 level and now everyone can pretty much bypass the defenses? How is that fun???

carries, through, version, I like the balance the game carries through each version.
Based, on, games, Based on the other games this one is good without even playing it.. I'd be saying that
freezing, on, device, The endless levels are repeatedly freezing on my device.
need, with, heroes, This is good I like how this is not pay to win because even with premium powerful heroes you still need strategies to win pls keep making games like this
buy, with, stars, Kingdom Rush is one of the better tower defense games, though I didn't enjoy it as much as their last one. One thing that was annoying; how some of the stages paths were jumbled and you wouldn't know which path to upgrade. It did add a bit of a challenge, which is good for any game worth dL-ing, but as I said, it was annoying. It'd be nice if there was a "5 more waves" option to buy with the leftover stars. On some stages, right when it gets really interesting, it's over. Good game overall.
Take, into, it, Take time into it and it's enjoyable
get, after, while, Had lots of fun though it does get a bit repetitive after a while
having, In, purchases, A truly great game. I love every part. Other than the game costing 3 dollars and still having In app purchases.
wrote, on, comment, addictive game, and I trust the publisher wrote on a comment here, that you can finish the game without any additional purchases

had, with, it, The veteran difficult (hardest difficulty) is the perfect difficulty for a game, had a blast with it!
got, into, genre, I never really got into the tower defense genre, but this completely changed my mind. It's very engaging, well thought out, just the right balance of challenge and reward. You really get the sense that your strategy worked when everything goes smooth. The heroes are also nice to upgrade and to play around with different styles of combat. The levels are a sight to behold and enemy types keep on changing appearances which keeps everything fresh.

earn, in, game, It's fun it's addicting but no way to earn the other heroes in game.
wows, with, graphics, This game always wows me with the graphics
compared, with, games, A fresh experience compared with the first 2 games, paid heroes are here as well, but for the starting price it's acceptable. I enjoy this game more than frontiers, fells like something different than the original (but in a good way)

Looks, like, this, Asking me to rate this game early on, after the third level, is annoying, but I gave it five stars because I liked the other Kingdom Rush games a lot. Looks like this will be a good addition to the series.
compared, to, Vengeance, (original 2017) The best entry in the Kingdom Rush Franchise! Go Elves Go!!! (2021 edit) Graphics still hold up and kinda nice. Even compared to Vengeance. Also better gameplay because branched towers is better than set of 5.
notch, from, Ironhide, Another top notch TD game from Ironhide. The story is a neat prequel, the free heroes are pretty good, and it can be a good challenge. It is well balanced... unless you pay for Phoenix. This flaming bird of death is truly an AoE damage legend that can incinerate damn near anything. I enjoyed it, and consider it well worth the $3.

outdone, with, writing, An amazing prequel to the Kingdom rush series! The people of Ironhide game studios have truly outdone themselves with writing, art design, and game mechanics. They added so many things that lead directly into the first game that it is genius! And they added a new hero ability mechanic which just makes the game that much more fun!

has, to, it, Fun mobile version of a classic. Campaign has a nice touch to it.
increases, for, seconds, Exactly the same as the free version, but worse. Diamonds cost the same as the free version, but tower upgrades are more expensive, the enemies take more to kill, towers can be destroyed, and the refresh time is longer; meaning more diamonds will be needed. Gold bags aren't a thing. Only this stupid over-priced glove that increases gold income for a few seconds. Just stick with the free version. This base game isn't expensive, but it's paying for a worse and ultimately more expensive product

outdoing, with, game, Absolutely fantastic, Ironhide keeps outdoing themselves with each new Kingdom Rush game. Completely new art, same tower progressions, new upgrade tree, and new hero power abilities for you to use. I love the new and old systems in play. Great job Ironhide!
played, for, that, Top mobile game ever in my opinion. I'm not a bot I swear lol, but these games are the only mobile games that I have played for like years. Def worth the money in my opinion

seen, for, this, I was a bit hesitant to try this, but it was 100% worth it. Great levels that balance enjoyment and difficulty, creative enemies and bosses, and post-game campaigns that are not only enjoyable, but require skill. I've seen a lot of one star reviews for this, but all of them are made by people who are outraged they have to make a choice to not buy extra heroes. Great game, excited for Legends. 😘
spent, on, DLC, I really love this game it's so cool seeing some the main story characters in their prequel-era. I also spent all my money on the DLC.
playing, since, 2015, Cool game. Been playing since 2015.
holds, to, roots, One of my all time favorite games as a kid growing up was Kingdom Rush and Kingdom Rush Origins holds true to its ancestral roots. Love the game!
compared, to, games, Very well done, just feels limited compared to some other TD games. The story adds a nice touch though.
pay, for, game, Great game, but I don't like that most heroes are money locked. I would rather pay more for the game, and then get more heroes, but for these pay-to-win times, this is the best case scenario.
hoping, for, part, But i'm sad 😔 because I finished all 3 parts it i'm still hoping for a part 4 😀. If you dont have this game you must have to get it its the best game ever!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁

paying, in, game, These TD series should not be in Google play pass. It's useless and difficult to play without paying in the game. This shows that obviously you need to buy gems to progress in the game.

payed, for, 5, You buy the game just to discover that you payed just for 5 out of 16 characters. Want to play with other characters? Pay 5+ bucks for each! Dev, if you are gonna reply to this the way you usually do, "the game is designed so that you can finish it with the 5 characters alone", don't bother... How about I sell you a car that is perfectly drivable with just one seat, but you pay to use the other seats? TL/DR: get it on steam in full for a fraction of the price...

beat, On, levels, It's a newer version of previous KR games, and I like the new towers powers. My only complaint remains the same: there's no fast forward button. On levels I cannot beat toward the end, 13/15, for example, I don't need to sit through the first 12 rounds. Please add this feature. It gets boring quickly when I have to sit through the same level forever just to try to beat the last two rounds.

listen, to, music, Nice but the problem is play the game while listen to my favorite music.. I can't listen my music at all while play this game
spending, on, it, Great TD game. Perfect for spending a few minutes or a few hours on it.
playing, since, 2015, Have been playing this series since 2015 (IIRC), recently bought almost all the games - they're cheap, fun and engaging! I don't usually get into games, but this is fire! Great sound effects too. :)

pay, for, game, Solid game, lots of tower strategies and customization. The champions cost money even though u pay 3$ for the game.
wellplay, at, level, Best TD game, but difficulty level is high, I cant wellplay even at easy level, so I cant relax my mind and even get pressure😑
balanced, for, difficulties, Pretty much SCAM of a game. Early levels are balanced ok even for harder difficulties but you REALLY feel the push to make you buy real money upgrades. Since it's P2P I was hoping this will be honest game. Nothing but trying to get the most money out of people. Sad
developing, for, price, My childhood ;_;. Thanks for developing game on android for reasonable price its fun as always <3
say, besides, this, There's nothing more I can say besides this is a great game and a great series.
Reminds, of, type, Fun game. So addictive many options and details make it really fun. Reminds me of a zelda type
installed, since, moment, It is absolutely a cute tower defense game! Love it, and since the moment I installed it, I haven't put my phone down a minute!
delivers, Like, games, Like the previous games Kingdom Rush always delivers.
distracted, from, game, i love love love this game. pretty challenging and very detailed. seriously, there are so many little details in the levels that i almost get distracted from the game itself.
challenging, in, way!I, The best of this kind all three of Kingdom Rush are entertaining, funny,and challenging in a relaxing way!I really raccomand them all!Also the ads are available if one wants to buy gems for extras weapons!
come, as, fun, Amazing game. One of the best games you can download. Played this many time and alwyas come back as its challenging, fun and not don't have to keep pressing buttons on the screen.

debited, from, account, I bought a hero, money was debited from my account but it still says I have to buy the hero in the game and I am unable to use it. Help?

Got, at, price, Got it at discount price, 1.29, would have puis up to $5 for it. Really good if you even simply liked kingdom rush

get, over, mechanic, It's okay. I just cannot get over the mechanic of enemies creating new paths leading basically to the end, or the enemies who phase around the paths and wind up near the end. It feels cheap. Oh, you didn't fortify the very end of the path? Well here comes 50 enemies who just phased around all of your defenses. Usually just ends in a restart and then prepping for it next time, but the point is it's artificial difficulty and I dislike it.

Start, with, one, The FUNNEST Kingdom Rush Game. I'm a huge fan of the series and this one is by far the funnest to me. Great heroes, great spells, I beat this one way quicker than the others. Start with the first one or Frontiers I would recommend. But once you get some games under your belt you'll love this one too.
pay, for, champs, This game has provided entertainment since I was a kid and still holds up. Having to pay for champs is kind of a drag and not having a fast forward option are the only gripes I have.
played, off, game, This is a very good game and I played all off the Kingdom Rush game's
deducted, for, dragon, Money was deducted for dragon, but it didnt unlock. Stupid game i want refund for my purchase
paid, for, this, Don't like the constant pop ups and also I paid full price for this, whats with the freemium stuff? Game is alright

is, of, KR, After playing this game I bought every other game there is of KR, its fast paced gameplay and its alot more unique which is what alot of TD games lack. I really love this game and i hope they can expand their games into something big :) From Big Donner Kebab

download, onto, device, Love the whole KR series. There's 4 games and I download all 4 onto each device I get. They are endlessly replayable, even if you start over. I love to play them on flights, it makes the flight pass quickly. Can't recommend enough!

Love, in, frontier, Best grapic in the series. Not my favorite but thats my opinon. Love the mech in frontier.But man it looks nice man.I liked the boat map in frontier but this is nice all way around.My only complain is the paid heros.but the free are fine.I did buy denas.
lounging, at, home, Played a few rounds so far and overall smooth and fluid game play. Enjoying it while I wait or even lounging at home, this is a good TD to enjoy
paid, for, game, Great TD game but most the characters are behind a pay wall and I've already paid for your game and that doesn't sit well with me
sit, with, me, Great TD game but most the characters are behind a pay wall and I've already paid for your game and that doesn't sit well with me
play, on, iPod, Super fun! You ever play that balloon game on your iPod? Yeah, this is pretty much the same idea just a whole lot more enjoyable.
needs, on, map, So far, it's my least favorite KR game. Too much that needs your attention on the map. Still, a KR game is better than most.
buy, with, money, Love it so far! Fun and way more challenging than I was expecting. Love the art and design of it too. My only complaint is that you're expected to buy additional heros with physical money, instead of being able to earn them as you play or buy them with an in-game currency. Feel like a game that you already have to buy shouldn't have very many in-app purchases... and I'm sure many others will agree.

closing, in, middle, I'm using honor 9x pro mobile and have some issues with this game always closing in the middle of the game wich is annoying becouse the game can't autosave in the middle of the game wich forced me to start all over and shutting again. I love the game and sorry for having to write about this issue here becouse i cant find any report button inside the game . If it's not fixible can i get a refund for the game and the charchters insid the game.

paid, for, app, The Kingdom Rush games are all excellent. I'm not wild about the IAPs for an already paid for app, but it's still SOOOO good.
forgetting, about, time, Definitely keeps you busy, forgetting about the time.
play, since, 13, Always the best game i ever play since 13, never get bored of the story. Good character with a lot of skill variation. Challenging levels and enemies with bosses. Fun tower combination. Very pleasant gaming experience. 10/10 cartoonie graphic.
make, for, fun, This is yet another classic TD game. I'm not wild about micro-transactions, so I'm glad that Play Pass includes all of the Kingdom Rush series. Since this isn't their first game, a lot little improvements make for extra fun, but without sacrificing much of the winning concepts in the earlier games.
Bought, on, sale, Bought it on sale. It was a steal
immerses, into, game, I love the clean art that immerses you into the game, which is much better than kingdom rush. Unfortunately, I didn't see improvements with starting new rounds since Kingdom Rush, because the button is often blocked by the escape button. But I still love this game and it's definitely worth a shot.

played, from, guys, So far every tower defense game I have played from these guys has been really good. Love how interactive the game play is instead of just building towers you have to use other things to pass a stage.
connect, to, store, Used to love playing this game and even owned some in game characters. Got a new phone and cant reclaim my bravebark, tells me i cant connect to the play store and all the prices are question marks. Once/ if this gets fixed for me I'll give it 5 stars bc i love the game.

looking, for, something, If you are looking for something after the free version this one is the right choice. Its the 2nd best one after Vengeance. Good jokes, well balanced

loved, for, years, Ive loved this game for years
played, for, long, It is a amazing tower defense game played the kingdom rush series for so long and I loved this game it has cool towers and and amazing heros but you have to pay for them but that's ok.

progress, on, level, Game is okay, the enemies have weird abilities and feels tidious to play (often you need to wait ages to progress on a level). Other KR games are better
try, for, thanks, I got to try the game for free thanks to play pass! I am giving the game 1 star because they charge $3 for it. There are other games that are better of the same genre that are free. Would gave given 3 stars otherwise.

expanding, with, details, Simple, yet engaging. I would suggest expanding the storyline with more details, so as to create more complex campaigns.
built, as, boost, Challenging without being too frustrating. Would be nice if one could get some credits built up as a boost within the game for having spent time here... Hmm? Mahalo, Auntie Sandy.
win, like, %, This game is awesome and not pay to win garbage like 99% of games on here. Highly recommended!
come, with, game, Love the lore or the KR series! Awesome prequel to the KR timeline, can't wait to see what new game they come up with next! Try to find all the easter eggs in every level BTW 😋

set, on, mode, First time td. I think I picked right one! Loads of fun, and not too difficult, when set on easy mode, to figure out. Recommended!
start, with, this, Another great game from Ironhide. If you like tower defense this is a top notch choice. If you've never played tower defense, start with this or another game from the publisher. Engaging game play, great aesthetic, poppin music. Not a deep story, but enough to bring some context and flavour. Never *need* to make any additional purchases beyond initial game to play through, but the option to expand choices is there for those who want some extra content. Lots of fun to be had here.
came, to, game, great game! I came to this game because of the original kindom rush. I am not disappointed.
came, because, rush, great game! I came to this game because of the original kindom rush. I am not disappointed.
thought, as, versions, It was nice but not as well thought out as the previous versions
take, on, TD, So far, I have really enjoyed the game. It's a great mythical take on old fashioned TD.
reached, after, weeks, It's a great game with different ways to play to make it challenging. However after only a few weeks I reached the end. Why are there not more levels? I see multiple other games to buy.
go, For, years, Consistently Fun tower defense. For years now every time I go to my play store library to check for games I end up installing one of these great story filled tower defense games. I don't know how to do reviews and the sounds cheesy to me so I'm just going to leave it at that.

listen, to, music, I love all the small details and reference the only thing that i don't like is that im not able to listen to music while playing
got, in, two, I was bored one night so i downloaded the first one. Not being a fan of tower defense games shows how bored I was. This game is a classic in the making. I have played the first 3 so far and its not pay to win. Sure you can buy heros but thats just buying a cheat code. All levels are easily winnable on all 3 versions I have so far, and I got max stars in the first two. Just gotta play smart. The extra heros are basically paying to cheat.
put, on, face, Absolute fun. Not designed to be unbeatable and yet offering some decent challenge. Little secrets and references to other material (games, books, films and comics) put a smile on my face. Big thank you to the developers. This little game is a delight!

looked, for, games, I originally played the fiest one on computer and loved it, then I found out it was on mobile, and installed it right away. After I finished it, I looked for other games by Iron Hide and I wasn't disappointed. This one is much better in most areas, like heroes, and things to interact with in the map, buffed the soldiers on the ground, and changed some things like how the wizard tower fires. I love these games and I always will. These games are the only games I take time and review. -Ron Man

found, for, device, One of the best Tower Defense games I've found for my mobile device. Good job!
Came, after, months, Came back after 3 months to look back at this game which will have a permanent place in my heart. Still the same, but i really enjoyed it! Had completed this game about 2 or 3 months ago, went for the original kingdom rush. Keep it up, good devs!!

knew, about, game, Honestly, before I knew about this game and played the more of, "future ish" type kingdom rush, I always wanted to know what made all this a thing? And when I found out about this game the one thing I wanted came true. I got to learn about how it happened. But aside from that, the gameplay was really good. It was just like the other game just a bit different. The style that you use for the characters is one of the things I like the most. I've actually used your character design for a few drawing

run, past, infantry, The defensive unit A.I which was perfect in the original game is absolute garbage in this. The enemies just run past my infantry as if the A.I is braindead
played, at, times, Beat tower defense game ever played at times hard to beat and at time funny with in game voice
adds, to, titles, The rush series are perhaps the best tower defense games around, although this is the weakest in the series the visuals are washed out pastel and the gameplay adds nothing new to the previous titles.
playing, since, instalment, Been playing Kingdom Rush since the first instalment I bumped into on Kongregate. Then it was on Android. Needless to say, I was a hardcore fan since day one and I am NOT exactly a lover of tower defense type of games. So yeah, it's that good. Props to the developers!

click, on, refund, Not giving me refund I didn't installed the app n click on refund but it didn't refund the amount which was deducted worst app so plz don't install Any aap of irongames OK Bakwas app developer
play, with, style, Very well made game, it reminds me of when I would play the OG kingdom rush when i was younger. No adds which is just a plus. It feels so magical and mistic to play with a very cool art style, worth the price!
beat, without, heroes, It it basically pay to win game. There is no way you beat the chapter 2 above without the most expensive heroes (it is cheap tho only $4). I have max lv phoenix but sill have difficulties beating the stage
spend, during, quarantine, Best game to spend time during quarantine.
playing, for, 10years, I have been playing this game for more than 10years since the fist kingdom rush. So much fun. Wish ironhide can created more games. Thank you.

kept, during, levela, Was my favorite. Recently redownloaded and the game kept freezing during the last Campaign levela. Disappointed.
