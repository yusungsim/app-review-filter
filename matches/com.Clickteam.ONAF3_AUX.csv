'm, game, mid, I, Very good game and I'm very happy with how smooth the game runs. I have no bugs except when I'm mid game and leave the app (to go text a freind and come back) when I come back it lags although I just re open the app so it 99% always works and so far 4 stars:))

's, game, last, it, Very cool game! I didn't know this game and that everyone was nostalgic to it until now. I'm sad that it's the last game, but I hope the community of the FNaF and ONaF will encourage and help you make more games of the ONaF franchise so that ONaF will be continued!

is, time, last, this, played the very first flumpty game back on 2015 waited for the second one bit more intense than 1 but after hearing news about new flumpty game being cancelled I became a bit sad but after hearing the story of why it was cancelled I respect that but now year's after year Finally a new Flumpty game sad since this is the last time we'll ever see him but what a great way to end a series on a good note hopefully we see merch probably not or maybe would love to have a Grunkfuss figure
