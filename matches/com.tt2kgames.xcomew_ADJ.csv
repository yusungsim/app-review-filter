NOUN, ADJ, 
game, good, Even though this was a good game to play on the pc and console, the problems with this game is you need some serious mobile hardware to play this. When i was playing this cutscenes were fine however at some points the game was crashing or other times stalling from granade explosions. The game was also crashing at random when i was just in the xcom hq managing things.

glitches, odd, I've had this for ages, and I'm playing through again on a tablet, which is going pretty well. A few odd glitches but overall still a great game. But I actually came here to explain to others that even though I also get the "no Google account" error, it's simply that it's trying to connect to Google+, bless its heart. Turns out that it still saves on the device itself just fine if I select a spot to save and hit "next." I do wish the devs would break the news about Google+ to it, though.

bugs, visual, I love this game, I just wish the developers just fixed the visual bugs, cloud save, and the bugs overall... it just needs one last update

game, great, Tries to cloud save to Google+, which predictably fails, given that it hasn't existed for 2.5 years now. Misregisters the location of your touches so you have to tap sightly above buttons, and you get stuck in one demo level because you can neither shoot or cancel your action. I'm sure it's a great game but it's been abandoned for years and is approaching unsupported obsolescence.

work, good, Gotdayum, why is this program so big? Did you just port it straight across?! Otherwise, killer game, keep up the good work
port, old, Honestly why does it need to access contacts, phone history, etc. Seems pretty predatory for an old XCOM port.
devices, current, Fun game but has been abandoned by the devs for another version. Avoid paying money for this as crashes are frequent due to lack of updates to current mobile devices.

minutes, few, As stated by others, even though I'm properly logged into Google Play, the game will not save on my Android 9 device. Also, it does not properly center on my screen and the button presses must be a little above each button. Epic fail... Got a refund within a few minutes of testing the game.
graphics, good, Far as iv seen no bugs or glitchs, solid controls good graphics and a solid ammount of content, great game!

maps, More, The game is great, but will there be any updates? More maps? Maybe some of the DLC's? Updated graphics? Even if I had to pay again, that would be nice for those who can't run Xcom 2 on their phones and being fair, this port doesn't really hold in 2021.

version, original, The game is close to the original PC version, just some minor animations are missing have some glitches near the end game, the game just suddenly exit and loading from autosave immediately does the same so I have to load previous save and lost around two hours of progress.

game, Overall, Overall great game. The only problem is the game is opted for a lower quality phone so sometimes the game will freeze then crash if you have a higher quality phone. The graphics look very poor and there's no way to change that in the settings

save, local, Can't even manual local save on device. Also no cloud saves . Avoid this game like the plague , no developer support and last update was over 4 years ago.

game, great, It's a great game but saving is impossible. I can't log into a Google account so my progress is never saved. Worked fine on the last phone had. It's just giving an error message. This game is unplayable without being able to save progress. Skip it until you see reviews saying its been addressed.

game, fun, It crashes when trying to load it resume game. It's a fun game but what's the point if you can't beat it. This problem is very common, the game isn't well optimized for mobile.
positions, elevated, Looks great, controls are glitchy. Getting into elevated positions is iffy at best. It errors when loading or saving because Google+ doesn't exist any longer.
cloud, other, Gameplay is quite awesome but left lil bit disappointing because unable to cloud saves using Google Play Games.. Unable to connect with other cloud saves available.. Maybe developer just didn't care about this game anymore..
game, good, It used to be a good game but it stopped working. On Xiaomi mi 10 miui 12.5 it doesn't let to perform some actions and it is impossible to complete missions.
game, good, It's a pretty good game after those years of release, I just wish that multiplayer had players like before
space, enough, I just bought a Samsung Galaxy A12 and was super excited to finally have enough space for XCOM again. Unfortunately it crashes on this phone too I guess. Such a bummer.

crashea, few, Only problem is it's a little zoomed in, making it more diffult to plan out an ambush without zooming out over and over. Everyone complaining about the elevation issue there's a camera button with an up and down toggle 🤦. Plays extremely well, only had a few crashea and those were only launching the game not in the middle of a battle. I'm honestly surprised how well This was ported over, and the price?? On steam and Xbox this still runs at $40, but here the exact game is $5. No brainer 💁

purchase, Pointless, Didn't even get 1 save. Crashes everytime you try. Pointless purchase that i can't get refunded for. Don't waste your money.

way, best, Device: one plus 7 pro The game runs and looks great. Works perfectly with touch controls. Except for the pc this is the best way to play the game. I've had one slight issue where because of my curved screen some UI elements don't quite display right, but it doesn't impact gameplay at all so it's nothing major. I haven't tested controller support but the touch controls work so well that I wouldn't use one anyway, might be worth looking into if you have an android TV though.

game, Great, Great game and a good port until you need to load. Mine crashes every time I load the game without fail. I literally can't play unless I want to start from scratch. It's a shame because I was really getting to like my squad.

game, good, Just the cloud save needs fixing. Really good game. Wish xcom 2 wasnt sooo expensive on android, id get it if it eas alot cheeper.
game, great, Crashes on any attempt to save. Get used to seeing "Failed to write save" and starting from scratch. The cloud save and Facebook login aren't compatible with the latest Android. Otherwise a great game but not the type you can play without access to saves. Please fix compatibility issues.
session, first, Bought the game, but it just won't install! After downloading 3gigs of data, it says, failed to install! Bought the game cause I have played xcom 2 and UFO after math and after light. This was disappointing. Edit: they fixed the bug, however, after my first session it seems the save file got corrupted, due to which I am unable to load it again. 2-3 hours of game save. At this point I have given up really. Just play it on your system guys, X-com just isn't working out for on the go

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game, but I've encountered 3 issues that are a bit annoying. Cloud Save doesn't seem to work, I've had occasional never ending loads after a mission causing me to that progress, and minorly, some crashes continuing a game in progress, resolved by force closing the game and restarting. 4 stars despite those issues.

And We will be watching Commander!..

port, Great, Great port of awesome game. The only issue I face on Xiaomi Redmi 9 (Android 10) is creshes when last save loads, I need to start the game once more. But no other issues, all saves aren't broken, the story is great as well as performance.

hours, countless, Simply love the game and has rob me of countless hours of my life 😆. But seems to have run into and error at the Temple Ship where I'm unable to enter the bridge area. Can't even pass the door. The door seems to black out when I stand directly infront of it. I really hove the developers can help me out as I would love to support any future development. Thanks. I'll give a 5 star once this problem has been rectify.

gameplay, Phenomenal, Phenomenal gameplay. It's like digital crack lmao . But the game being this complex I was expecting it translating to TOUCH controls would take some getting used to. And it did. Even still it gets weird on occasion but definitely works well enough to not be too bothersome. I barely notice the jank anymore. Impressive port nonetheless. 👏👏

game, hit, I love this game but for some reason the game keeps closing after i start loading the game I get to the title screen hit resume game it loads and before it comes on the game closes
port, decent, Is fun to play and easy to get sucked into. A decent port although I don't think it will get a compatibility update with future Android OS systems. Can be buggy and have wonky touch controls at times along with the occasion crash. But still worth me putting 55+ hours into it across multiple playthroughs.

updates, latest, So I'm using this game on a Google Pixel 3a XL with android 11 and latest security updates. It works very well. The only "crash" instance happens if the game is newly loaded and by clicking on the resume game option BEFORE the game has established contact with the Google Play server. Just wait a few seconds until your player level displays and then continue. No other issues. Yes, the game play gets getting used to from a PC and mouse combo, but after a while it works. Good Port.

game, Awesome, Awesome game.. except every time I try to save my progress the game crashes. Hate to leave a 1 star review, but the game is broken for me so I've requested a refund
members, squad, I'm a fan of XCOM on pc and so having it on mobile was an idea I loved. Unfortunately, I can't move any of my squad members to higher elevations, mainly roofs. Using the camera controls to raise the level of the camera still leaves the roof in shadows and tiles can't be selected to move a soldier to. Often times it will just click through the roof and the camera will switch to showing the inside if the building instead. This makes them game much more difficult and no longer play it.

stars, due, Functions well on a tab s7+ and is fun to play. However, I can't give it five stars due to the glitchy audio and slightly clunky controls.

fan, Huge, Loved the game on PC, religiously played LW, love the sequel. Huge fan. Why the low score? I just lost half my campaigns save files. No idea how that is possible. It shouldn't be. Same SD card, same everything else. Nothing worse in these kind of strategy games. Could u restart? Yeah, I could. Can I trust that I won't simply be pouring hours into an experience just to have it evaporate yet again? No. I can't. Hard to bring myself to recommend a game with game breaking bugs baked in. Ouch.

potential, much, Has so much potential. The original XCOM games on PC control so well. This doesn't. I can't change the elevation to move troops on or off rooftops using either the two finger method or the on-screen controls. The camera constantly zooms all the way in, as if that's ever what I want it to do. It runs fine on my Galaxy S9 but looks worse than screenshots of the console versions from almost 8 years ago.

time, actual, So glitchy its unplayable. Guys get stuck on rooftops, game freezes, screen text doesnt match the screen. It literally took longer to install this game than i got of actual playing time before uninstall. Very disappointed; been playing x-com since the original.
phones, modern, Needs an update for modern phones. I am seeing a lot of touch inconsistencies in my phone.
view, general, I'm playing on classic and I'm glad I didn't turn on Ironman mode. It difficult to navigate the map, I accidentally tap the screen twice and my unit just ran out in the open. Every movement have to be confirm because touchscreen suck. I was trying to see if my soldier can make it to the cover, that mistake cost me a game. Why the game keep zoom in everytime when switching soldier? It doesn't even make sense to do that, I want to get the general view of the battle not a close of a solider.
download, slow, Very slow download. In the past it got self aborted once the download reach half of it.

port, Great, Great port runs faster on this phone then ps4, the thing is guys get a 1,000$ or up phone your complaints will cease about lag, crashes, slowdowns, that simple, if you can't afford the phone then this game is not for you.
fun, Super, Super fun and pretty well adapted
version, older, "This App was built for an older version of Android." I refunded 5min after noticing the app is defective, but Google didn't approve it unfortunately. Such a pity :(
level, second, This game seems phenominal. But the fact that I can't make a soldier do an elevation change with a two finger drag makes me want to do a refund. The tutorial says it should work. My experience with the game says it doesn't. I'm in the second level and I can't make the guy on the roof get to the ground. Nothing works. Seriously, how could you not employ a simple onscreen toggle that lets me change elevations? You broke what could have otherwise been a perfect android port?

port, good, Pretty good port of Xcom. Controls work surprisingly well. Graphics are at PS 3 level. Only down-side is like half the maps are missing and you can't play the special missions "slingshot" and "elite soldier". Wish those missions and maps were added back in. "Long war" mod support would also be nice.

gen, next, Great Port - I loved this game on my console, and when I upgraded to a next gen, sadly enemy unknown and the full expansion wasnt available. My first xcom experience was on the good old amiga back when I was in secondary school. The first game where you felt distraught if you soldiers were killed, as you lost them for good. This port brings back all the thrills and tear bringing lows and is a faithful recreation and now I can assume my role as the commander once more, and destroy the grey menace

complaint, only, The game is great like really great but I would had liked if you upgraded the graphics thats my only complaint so y a I hope you upgraded the graphics.
message, following, The game it's good until crash I really enjoying the game BUT some times it's just close without any error message, just close and I lost my progress... I realized that when I try to sync my save with the cloud, the error also happens. Sometimes when I open the game the following message appears: "This game was developed for previous version of Android" I'm now on Android 10. Please developers make it fully compatible with newer Android.

controls, awful, Would be great if not for the awful camera controls. This game seems determined to keep you zoomed in so far that you cant see anything, and on top of that is only capable of slowely panning around the map. Most of your time in battle will be spent thumbing around trying to see something that isnt the 10 squares around your soldiers that the game seems to think is all you need
game, Awesome, Awesome game recommended
OS, android, The game pretty much won't work with any Chromebook anymore. That's because if you have a Chromebook, then google keeps updating their android OS, and their latest version of Android has basically broken the game completely.

buggy, little, The game is just like you remember, only a little buggy here and there but hey, thats XCOM baby
game, Pretty, Pretty decent game. I have problems loading sometimes using resume. Hitting single player seems to have taken care of that. I have XCOM:UFO Defence for PS1 and it's my favorite game all time. This is ok so far, could be better tho. Especially aiming percent algorithms. 80% chance to hit misses at LEAST 50% of the time which makes it very hard to survive an win even on easy mode ( and I have aiming device on them to give an extra 10% ). Your guys get killed because you miss 3 out of 4 80% shots.

feedback, good, I wish to five a good feedback. I am a follower of pc series. The mobile implementation has 3 problems. Not being able to save between missions. Long time to start playing. It is difficult to be precise when selecting characters.which delays the game agility. Finally, if you leave the app open while doing soemthing else it is going to eat battery and get your mobile warm.

game, absolute, This is my absolute favorite PS3 game. I just got a Galaxy Tab A7 and was shocked to see that there is an Android version, which I decided to buy (because it's my fav). This version works better on the tablet than on the PS3! As I'm playing I keep muttering, "This is so freaking awesome!" If you like this game, don't even hesitate. I personally believe this game is one of the best games EVER made, and the Android version on my tab A7 does not disappoint!

part, Worst, Devs don't keep this updated. Worst part is it does work for a while in new devices but then you can't load games and you already lost the time for a refund. Don't buy unless you have an old phone.

position, elevated, Its almost impossible to climb to an elevated position. Pls fix it
multiplayer, multi, Please add multi multiplayer to it
refund, Requested, Cloud saves busted. You WILL get a message saying your phone is too new for the game to work correctly. If it does work enough to play, the game zooms in on your dudes when you select them making you take the time to pinch zoom out on every action. This makes the game tedious to play. Requested refund.
upgrades, new, Awesome. Why wasn't there new upgrades to the game ? Like new scenarios, new alien, new story unfold etc ? Concept is great but lacks development.

event, more, Please bring the multiplayer mode back and make the mkbile ver same like the pc. Fpr example, the equipment per soldier, in pc/console ver they have 2 equipment slots, but the mobile only have 1 slots equipment. And the guardian armor that can flying. You only can fly 2 step. And add more event, like train mission, mission on the dam, and that asian guy.

request, large, I love this game so far, and it's worth every penny, I would love to see xcom 2 on mobile as well I've seen lots of videos of it on YouTube and I'm loving how it plays. I know it's a bit of a large request but could xcom 2 be put on mobile and someone make mods for the games on mobile plz, also what's up with the multiplayer feature not working on here, it's frustrating to say the least.

Just used to save option and you'll be fine.

time, long, It used to work really well for me. But it seems the game hasn't been updated in a long time and it works poorly on my new phone. Also the elevation change with two finger swipe seems to completely not work at all and elevation changing is very messy and clunky in general and causes me to be unable to see things I should be able to like what's on the roof.

time, long, Even though I love the series I give this a 4 star for the fact that it refused to download for 3 hours and when I was going to take a video of it for my you tube it was completely removed from my phone so I have to go through the process again by the time you we this edit It got removed which was my phone's fault but it takes so long to download because it refuses for a long time

If your using a small phone, the dark graphics, while chilling, can be hard to see what exactly is going on. I personaly found a bug which stopped me progressing. Which is a shame. Hope Xcom 2 doesn't have the same issues, when it's released.

port, good, This is a very good port of XCOM: Enemy Within to Android. Loading times are very fast, graphics are generally clear, the sounds are very good when I listen through headphones, and the gameplay is as difficult and fun as I remember on the Steam version. My only issues have been that sometimes the touch input thinks you want to launch a grenade when you're just trying to move the landing spot a little, and there is a (edge case) AI bug that may cause an infinite loop requiring a force quit.

mobilu, pre, Hra r.2012 na PC a hra roku na Android do teraz..pretože stále od vydania pre mobily (r.2014) nemá konkurenciu na Android, iOS a na PC mu konkuruje iba XCOM 2 ..nehladte na cenu je to TOP a na rozdiel od hack & crack je aktualizovaná + stiahne sa verzia pre váš model mobilu. Ide skvele aj na Acer z630 (low end) aj na Galaxy Note 4 (hight end) samozrejme iná verzia pre model aj inak vyzerá. Na Note 4 je to nádhera, na Acer je hra len pekná. Je to skutočná kvalita PC titulu ktorá nie je oproti PC verzie okrem grafiky a pár micro DLC odsekana. Je to 100% klon a už len dùfat že raz aj vyjde do mobilou kompletný XCOM 2. Nemusíte sa báť ovládania - je to skôr pre väčšie mobily, alebo tablety..

X, best, The BEST. It's the best X-Com and it's here on mobile.
game, Good, Good strategy game. Toned down from PC version but still fun to play. Pray to your RnG god/s before downloading
mission, first, The game stuck at the first mission. I'm suppose to lunch a rocket but it doesn't work when I press accept and I can't do any other action.

port, excellent, An excellent port of the console/PC classic. The graphics take a hit but they still get the job done and the whole game including the dlc is in there. Endless hours of turn based alien fighting to be had. My only real complaint is the lack of physical controller support but the touch screen controls do the job. This is the best cell phone games I've ever played.

issue, same, Broken. Played for all of 5 minutes before I was unable to carry out any actions with my squad. Reloaded, same issue. Shame as I love the Xcom games and was happy to pay to play it on my phone. Total waste of money

devices, other, Purchase a game, and it doesn't get updates for 3 years?! That's completely sad. The sync with Google Cloud no longer works, so you can no longer resume a game from other devices. I lost my saved games when I had to replace/upgrade my Android. Absurd!

rates, high, The game is great. But I'm giving it 3 stars just because it's locked at 30fps. I'm pretty sure that my phone would be able to run it at 120fps without any problems. Please update the game to support high frame rates and add some graphic settings so the game can look as good as on PC. Nowadays phones are definitely powerful enough to run this game at higher graphic settings and frame rate.

game, Great, Great game just old app. Still works but needs a update
game, Great, Great game with lots of additions, but the cloud save crashes the game.
graphics, less, Plays like the pc verison with less graphics. Enjoyed playing it even after beating the game on the pc.
game, better, Work well for 3/4 of the game, then it crashes. Was expecting a better game for the price. Edit 1: Game loads when you select single player and then load the profile. Next step is to load the cloud saved game. It works!!! Form then on, all the missions are smooth. Edit 2: The final mission is unplayable!! A particular door never opens, blocking players way to next stage. Graphics: Average. Was not expecting more on a mobile port. Gameplay: Good. Controls are not as good as on console.

experience, best, Not the best xcom experience, it takes a while to load in game and whenever you leave you load in again. Buy the new xcom 2 app once it releases on Android instead
game, Good, Good game, but I can't save on my Galaxy Tablet S7. Please fix this!
retards, inept, The game cheats, skips your Soldiers turn. Not to mention that your Soldiers are a bunch of inept retards that can't hit the broad side of a barn with a Howitzer

phones, previous, I love this game. It works perfectly with my previous phones. But since I bought a new phone a Samsung A71, the game crashes when I start it, load the saved game, and even saving the game. I hope you can fix this and make this game compatible with my new phone.

xcom2, more, Absolutely EPIC experience transitioned to mobile flawlessly! Frankly, i like it more than xcom2
game, Great, Great game, very buggy, controls take getting used to and are not great even then.
time, damn, Seems ok, am only 4 missions in, but cant stand to load this game anymore, since it forces you to watch 5mins of intro every damn time you start the app. What brilliant idiot designed no way to skip it. Perhaps it's this 2k China company ad that is in the bs

game, Awesome, Awesome game! I loved XCOM: Enemy Unknown and i love this one too (XCOM: Enemy Within). I will say that the constant crashes is frustrating. Sometimes I'll have to open the app 7 or more time before it'll actually let me play; but that's the only real criticism i have for it.

review, Updated, Updated review. 5 years ago its realy impressive, even at today's rate its on the level. It's defiantly reduced compared to ps3 and no controler support. My old tablet and anther phone played multiplayer matches n touch is pretty good. it's a large 3.5 gig title and everything has failed downloading until like 4th try. So I found an old 7in sam tablet n I'm just trying to play multiplayer again with my son, can't download it GOOGLE. So I'll just keep trying "instal rulete" like I always did

bugs, many, Do not play this game in Ironman mode, there are just too many bugs.
version, older, Flat out doesn't work, everytime I tried opening it I got a message stating the game was made for an older version of my operating system. I would really enjoy an update that allows it to work on the more recent OS versions (Google Pixel 4)

game, excellent, an excellent game, that draws you in. music, drama, game play.
device, mobile, Love the game and details put into it... Negatives, takes time to get accustomed to the player movements, understandable though because of using a mobile device... and loading saved gameplay is terrible (7 out of 10 times connection to resume game fails),needs to be fixed.

game, Great, Great strategy game. It's an almost complete port of the 2013 PC game; includes all base-management and tactical-mission goodness that you could want. The three biggest issues in the game itself are: limited savegame slots (only 4? really? though not a problem if you like playing Ironman mode), semi-trivial UI issues (a few things which were easy with keyboard+mouse are not trivial with a touchscreen, like moving to a roof, and it's not hard to double-tap by mistake and cause your soldier to move) and that out of all specific missions the only one they kept was the horrible Site Recon. (Those missions are the only cut content - everything else is here, including cutscenes.) An additional problem is that the app is not updated since 2017 - either this or no-longer-present servers are probably to blame for cloud saves and multiplayer not working, and achievements/leaderboards not being viewable in the game itself (still can be viewed through Google Play Games app).

An additional problem is that the app is not updated since 2017 - either this or no-longer-present servers are probably to blame for cloud saves and multiplayer not working, and achievements/leaderboards not being viewable in the game itself (still can be viewed through Google Play Games app).

gamers, mature, Just a dude. I wanted to say XCOM is great for mature gamers who go crazy with it. However, the tutorial crashes and the campaign feels lopsided without it...Imma try again and rebuy it on PC BECAUSE...I had beat XCOM 2 with all expansions and am well aware these guys deserve honorable faith. It is NOT a cash grab or cheesy series. It's legitimate as a video game and I am picky with what I spend time on.

port, perfect, A near-perfect port of the console/PC game; everything you'd expect from the higher-end releases is here in full; the combat, the base management, the many instances of KIA, it's all here! The only real compromise here is the graphics, to allow for older devices to run it. But when the gameplay is this solid, that can easily be overlooked. And since XCOM 2 will eventually come to Android, there's no excuse not to give this a go, especially at only a $5 price point.

game, Best, Best game on android. This IS the Xbox game to a T, no gacha bs or hidden fees. 5 bucks for endless fun! Somehow it actually runs better on my phone than an xbox, no crashes so far. Only drawback I see so is the limited 4 saves which ain't much of a drawback! A+++++

game, Brilliant, Brilliant game, total bargain (but crashes a bit). If you don't know this game it is a port of a 2013 PC game. So for a mobile game the graphics are stunning & almost the whole game is in this version (just the odd bit of DLC and cutscene missing). Finally when you download, it warns you it might be compatible with latest version of Android. It works fine BUT it often (25% of time) crashes when you initially load. I find this less frequent if you don't use "resume last game" button to load.

port, Excellent, Excellent port but the controls can really bothering. Like when aiming grenades and rockets, sometimes it doesn't move and then when you try to swipe it, it thinks you're double tapping so it fires. Really frustrating. No complaints other then the controls

port, Fantastic, Fantastic port. Turn-based games like this is perfect for mobile. Only have minor gripes. Wish there was an option to turn off double tap to move, it was never precise enough to use reliably, especially when you start using areial units. Also, an option for scroll speed would have been amazing, rather than having to swipe a whole bunch of times to look around the larger levels. Some minor graphical glitches too. Overall, this is the best PC port I've ever played. Definite buy.

game, great, Overall just as good as the original, a great strategy game. Multiplayer won't work for me, kills battery fast (one mission can take over 15% easy), hots up your phone and is missing some content like cosmetics and cuteness but is still outstandingly fun, one of the best mobile games I own.

The list of accolades goes on as does my gratitude. Thanks dev team for delivering the goods again.

stars, Only, "Only" 4 stars because of Cloud problems, as a hardcore save-scummer being restricted to only 4 save slots is waaay too little (for safety reasons as well). That being said, game sometimes freezes during loads which leads to some save slots exclusively being used for "unstucking your progress" leads to even bigger frustration about the Cloud problem + no achievements are recorded which is annoying. Camera that resets every turn on it's starting position is abnoctious but it's still worth buying.

Camera that resets every turn on it's starting position is abnoctious but it's still worth buying.

port, good, Very good port. The controles are good enough to play the game. Some small inconveniences are the screen scaling and elevated position scaling. Make sure you are clicking where you think you are clicking when moving from ground to elevation.

price, Great, Great price for a full game + DLC. Gave 4/5 cuz sometimes the game crashes on startup. XCom on the phone is exactly what I'm looking for

game, great, The app should be updated to successfully work on the Samsung Tab S7. Such a great game should not go to waste. Please update.
GAME, SAME, NOT THE SAME AS FULL PC/CONSOLE GAME as it does NOT include content of the Slingshot DLC, Elite Soldier Pack DLC nor the Operation Progeny missions. - If those were included, it would be 5 stars even with the small graphics downgrade. Excellent game, anyway.

game, Great, Great game, I've finished it today (on a mobile phone - Samsung A51). The graphics are really cool, I liked both the short term and long term aspects of the game. The only problem I've noticed is related to the "save to cloud" feature, that does not work. But I had no need for that anyway. Lookin' forward to xcom2 for android.

phones, recent, Game is great but controls are bad and the game is not optimized for recent phones.
time, last, Runs terribly on note20ultra and company refuses to refund, last time I buy 2k games on the app store.
quality, Outstanding, Balls deep into the game, played it on the PS4 originally. Outstanding quality, was a little dubious about buying it. Worth every penny, it's the exact same game, a little tedious occasionally with moving the squad, nothing to take away a well deserved 5 star rating. Great job converting a great game to mobile! How about a free customised decal, armour, soldiers, ect, for an honest review ;) One happy customer! I'm using Samsung Galaxy S10.

glitches, visual, Proceed with caution. On my phone (Oneplus 6) there are visual glitches in the level and the UI.
formats, other, It's playable but it's much more annoying than attempting to play it on a laptop, console or pc. The distance settings are forgotten every time a turn starts forcing you to resize the screen constantly, the insides of buildings don't display unless you actually attempt to move someone into them, on other formats you can adjust the layer of the building you're looking at and there's no way to turn on a display of where it's possible to move to without first actually trying to move. It's annoying.
program, Unavle, Unavle exit program properly It seems developer abbandon it We hope the developer still improve the game.
port, Fabulous, Fabulous port from the original. Well made for mobile. Occasional glitch with saves but that's a small price to pay, and usually resolves itself with a second attempt to load. Truly, brilliant. Xcom fan forever!!

port, good, This is a classic! I love XCOM and this is fairly good port to mobile. Too bad developing ended years ago. There's little slowing down and it's easy to give wrong orders when battling. But it's still a very solid game.

feature, Saving, Saving feature is bugged, leaving the game basically unplayable Would appreciate an update that addresses this or perhaps barring that, a refund
frustration, Biggest, Have the devs abandoned this game as it hasn't been updated in three years?! Biggest frustration is the alien abduction mechanic of the game.Choosing one country out of three only for panic levels to rise exponentially throughout the continents the other two are from is a major flaw as it's game over too soon when 8 dropout after reaching the critical level.It's especially grating as you're getting a handle on the game, really enjoying it.Don't have the panic levels rise so high, please.

OS, current, I was worried since the devs abandoned the game years ago. I am pleased to say it works fine on a Samsung s10e with current Android OS as of 11/2020. It is a clone/port of the PC game, so there are some UI inconveniences as you would expect. But the game does not crash and there is only one game breaking bug that is easily avoidable once you find it.
galaxy, s10, Its a shame because I was enjoying this and then all of a sudden it started freezing all the time and crashing (galaxy s10)
throw, great, Love it, even on a phone that I consider sub-par.... All things considered. Fun and great throw back I didn't know was available in the play store.
port, Good, Good port but having to zoom out every single time you move a new character is a pain in the butt. Completely ruins the game for me. PLEASE MAKE THE VIEW ZOOMED OUT AND STAY THAT WAY AS AN OPTION I'M BEGGING YOU 🙏

game, offline, Worth the money, they fixed most of the problems. I just wish it was a bit easier to rotate the camera. There's a bug with the carapace or skeleton armor where you select decor 2, there is an arm brace floating in the air and stretches your characters arms when moving. Other than that if you want an xcom game on the go then I recommend buying this. You can play it on the plane as an "offline" game, so it's a great time killer without a real repetativeness to it like other mobile offline games.

port, decent, Xcom is very stressful. I'm addicted to stress. It's the way that I get things done. Runs mostly fine on my device, seems to be a decent port. Only occasionally screw over an operative due to a miss click.

mode, much, Auto save is pretty much iron man mode. Save games are buggy. Camera controls for zoom in and out are confused with turn. Gameplay is torture. A peon enemy can shoot you from across the map multiple times in a row, while your badass resource glutton mec, literally standing next to a peon, will miss, with a mini gun... .. . Yep. When you see things like this in gameplay you wonder, why am I spending my time on this...

Way, difficult, Way too difficult even at the lowest level! Avoid this game like the plague unless you like frustration. Even at the very lowest level, the game will kick your butt when you get to the covert missions. Whoever did the work to balance this game was out of their fricking mind.

feeling, great, Such a great feeling to be able to just buy and play! I hope they bring more titles like this to mobile because the mobile gaming market could really benefit from this practice. Cheers to you 2K, I hope you continue to bring games like this with the same lack of digital "padding" that others bring to the table

game, Decent, Decent game. If you are looking to kill a short amount of free time, this isn't the game for you. Load up time is over a minute and even then it tends to crash and close. If you are able to get in on the second (or third) try, the missions are time consuming. Like I said, it's a decent game, but I am not looking for a game that has so much load and play time requirements.

value, best, The best value for money mobile game I have purchased- although expensive it is a big game and I have played through 3 times now, so I reckon that it works out as the cheapest per hour played. It is tough, tactical and deeply satisfying when you beat it. The AI is good and challenging on normal. The controls are excellent. This is basically the full PC game on your mobile. Shame number 2 isn't being ported.

game, Great, Great game, but... It has it's graphic bugs. They don't bother me that much. What bothers me is that I cannot save on cloud. I switch phones allot and I want to be able to save online and continue on my next phone. They say it cannot be done... then why put that option in the menu? Anyways... it's a game worth playing and buying!

sounding, ish, Loved it! The story is bit silly but well written and people clearly put a tonne of sci-fi-ish sounding thought into it. But the game really shines in it's gameplay. You know that feeling you get when you start a new game with nothing and then end up at the ending feeling like an almighty force of God itself... This game got's that in aces of spades. Thanks developers!

difficulty, normal, I had loads of fun playing this game! Completed the game in normal difficulty. Some advice:- Develop your sniper he is a key part of completing the game successfully ;)

developers, more, Im playing on a GS9+. Why, why, why cant more developers bring actual games to mobile platforms? Far from another idle clicking, ad infested, p2w rubbish... this is a fully loaded port of one of the all time greats. It plays well on the small screen - my only gripes are some of yhe fine detail in control. Auto zooming in on characters, and not being able to turn off double-tap to move cause some problems. Its a banger.

gaming, mobile, Money well spent. This is what mobile gaming should look like, pay once and enjoy everything. 10 stars minimum for the game, developer, and app. Honestly I can't believe they made it this cheap, worth every penny. No internet needed, unless to save profile. Wish it got updated more, but no complaints
end, back, Amazing Game, but cloud-saves and multiplayer are broken. It looks like the game's Google Play Games integration is broken due to back-end updates and 2K has no plans to restore functionality. I was really hoping to play multiplayer, but this feature is broken. Otherwise it is a fantastic game, with everything the desktop version has (except a couple of DLC that another reviewer mentioned)

thing, biggest, The biggest thing you need to know is that the mobile port is missing a large chunk of customization options. The console versions came with the Elite Soldier and Slingshot DLC. Those two added a significant amount of customization options to the soldiers. So if you're buying the mobile port because you think you will have access to them, you wont. Customization options feel limited without those in the DLC. Less maps and no voiceover in different languages as well. Other than that, it's XCOM.

game, recent, A soldier that goes up a floot can't come down. The game also forces the tutorial so don't bother deselecting it. I reccomend you buy a recent xcom game on another platform cause this game is NOT it..
version, same, Exactly the same version as the consoles, totally love it.
play, Great, Great game play. Strategy, team development, and graphics.
game, hard, It is hard game
times, old, All fine. Childhood game. Need to get use to controls, but after you get used to controls game is awesome. Like old times.
game, greatest, Still the greatest game of all time. I'm completely addicted...please shorten the launch of the game and give the option to open quietly.i' m at work lol
end, low, Wow, I am impressed. Played through this twice on console and this port matches the experience. No problems on my low end phone either. I wasn't sure it would run smooth or at all. Controls are solid although it would have been nice to lock the camera zoomed out. Very pleased over all.
missions, other, Hope you also add the other missions of enemy within in the future also please add support to android 10 users please dont know if this will crash in days to come...aside from that keep it up👍
port, functional, What can I say? It's a fully functional port of XCOM EW.

Made me reconsider what a mobile game can be, and made me want more XCOM in my life. A franchise I had previously ignored on other platforms.

game, mobile, PSA: For everyone complaining about the controls and such... look people the game is massive for a mobile game so its gonna heat up your phone which can make the touch screen malfunction. If the controls are starting to act up, your phone is probably too hot.. turn it off or put an ice pack on that bad boy for a few and you should be good and keep your screens clean. That's all.

If the controls are starting to act up, your phone is probably too hot.. turn it off or put an ice pack on that bad boy for a few and you should be good and keep your screens clean. That's all.
port, shoddy, I love xcom but this is a shoddy port. Frequent glitches halt progress and cause a lot of frustration. I strongly recommend not buying this.

game, good, Very good f2w game.
effects, other, Experiencing problems with sound. After some time in game sound partially not working, can only hear music, no voice or other effects. Really ruins the game for me so far. UPD: Also crashes almost every second time I launch it and resume game. And controls are awful, as was mentioned by smb else here...

reviews, other, Forget it, wish i would've listened to the other reviews about the glitches. The fact i paid for it makes it so much worse - is there a way to rate this a negitve start rating?

port, Great, Great port, but it does not include the Anette Durand and Shaojie Zhang missions.
games, most, Was working but no more, every start up the download fails and fails to find resources. Tried reinstalling and still doesn't work, its a shame because most games on android never get fixed when this issue happens. Shame because this is an amazing game when it worked.

missions, first, The game is broken. The first tutorial missions are playable because every move is scripted. But I couldn't even get through the first actual mission due to a series of glitches. I restarted the app 3 times for 3 different glitches on the same mission then just gave up. So don't buy this.

times, several, I love this game but I've tried installing several times but it still hasn't actually installed
fun, much, Wow! Just wow! This is XCOM for PC, so so so much fun! I haven't tried the multiplayer, but the single player is just as I remembered in PC! Please oh please port XCOM 2! For those of you too young, or having never owned a gaming PC, XCOM is a game that comes from a genre that doesn't involve bombarding you with ads and P2W gameplay or unnecessary grinding and premium content! You buy the game, you get the full game!

game, great, A great game, a good port, however the multiplayer was ruined by google play, and now it will not work at all. It needs to be changed.

permissions, many, Asking for too many permissions is a turnoff
complaint, real, Absolutely fantastic, just what I've been looking for. Can't tear myself away. Only real complaint: I think money should be easier to get on the 'normal' level, an agency like this would never be this chronically underfunded. Unfortunately the app crashes numerous times before I get to play but so far has never done so during play.

port, good, It's a pretty damn good port. Or from the ground up, either way, it's xcom. I haven't gotten too far into it. So I can't really attest to the bugs. Though, I haven't encountered any, thus far. *after a recent system update for my galaxy a20, the game now says, after starting up, "this app was built for an older version of android and may not work properly.." we you guys be updating this game, as well? Or are we s.o.l?

game, great, Late to the party on this one, but this is still a great game for mobile. A little repetitive with the levels but challenging enough. Living up to the XCOM legacy.
screen, dual, I can't access Multiplayer. I have a LG V60 Thinq with dual screen. Everything else is spectacular. Having previous experience with Enemy Unknown, this app is everything I could want on the go. When I get access to multiplayer, this review will change to 5 stars.

controls, bad, Really bad controls. Have literally restarted levels because I can't place members in certain squares because the controls are reeeeeaaaaallly bad. It's touch screen, I get it, but this is bad. Fix your controls. For the record, veteran of XCOM on the PC.

laggy, little, A little laggy crashes a few times but it's good. My main complaint is that it's lacking some of the best content, like the mission where you rescue a psionic woman that I think leads into the base assault mission, in this version the base assault is far too early.

game, whole, Never played XCOM 1 on the pc, so I cant rlly compare this to that. However, I have played XCOM 2. If you want to have a XCOM experiance on the go, this is the game. There is also no microtransaction. You pay for the game you get the whole game. I haven't run into any bugs yet but by seeing the other reviews I'm sure I would encounter some. All in all, if you want a quality game on mobile and not those cash grab ad "games" you see in the top free section in the playstore, this is the game.

ratios, other, played this version first on 2017, and sadly no changes or updates since then. checked the cpu clock always stay at max 2.84ghz which is worrying. battery drained fast. have some buggy game crash early on. does not support other aspect ratios than 16:9. texture muddy and no details. dont look good at all for the file size. lots of missing feature from pc version. controls are decent. it's okayish for what it worth on sale. but hey, it's xcom on mobile! please continue to port your games firaxis

devices, newer, As a Xcom fan I really wanted to like this, but this port simply is flawed. It doesnt run smoothly even on newer devices. The controls and vision display are terribly wonky and I felt like I was fighting the controls on each turn just to be absolutely sure that the game doesnt misinterpret a double tap and get my characters killed. Overall, this doesn't feel like a completed product..

port, excellent, An excellent port of an excellent game. The camera controls can be a bit difficult at times but its manageable. The enemy movement and Meld indicators sometimes don't show up on the screen even though you can hear the audio for it. Few bugs here and there where the game crashes if you minimize it and sometimes crashes when you try to load a save. Nothing game breaking.

parameters, pointless, Disaster regarding Android controls. Maybe good on a PC, but the options menu here has maybe 5 pointless parameters to adjust. Turning the camera turns the wrong way if you go by the arrows. Also, every menu during battle, every character turn ends, that darn camera zooms and resets. I zoom out, it goes right back when turn is over. Seeing the entire battle is CRUCIAL, I don't need a zoomed in view of their shoes! Unplayable. Frustrating. Otherwise I liked it, except for that awful controls.

port, best, Likely the best mobile port ever. Some customisation options have been lost, there's a drop in graphic quality (duh), a couple of mission types are excluded, and the camera has a bit of a do on some levels. And... that's it. One of the best games ever made is available on mobile, and it works. I've finished multiple campaigns across 100s of hours. The only qualification is that you need to be happy sitting down and plugged in - this ain't for your commute. I really hope Xcom 2 will follow.

One of the best games ever made is available on mobile, and it works. I've finished multiple campaigns across 100s of hours. The only qualification is that you need to be happy sitting down and plugged in - this ain't for your commute. I really hope Xcom 2 will follow.

game, terrible, Facebook never connects. It says my xcom account cant create a multiplayer game. The multiplayer never connects! I paid for this terrible game not-optimized made by one of the biggest gaming companies in the world. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!

game, decent, This is a decent game but kinda impossible to get anywhere as your troops keep getting killed and the missions have too many operatives to defeat. Do not bother to install.

update, last, I should have read the reviews. Everything starts up fine, but once you are in a mission you can't see anything other than a command bar. Going into the options screen is broken too as only half of the graphics in the menus are visible. The last update for this game was in 2017. It's 2020 now, so all leaving this review is going to do his hopefully prevent others from wasting their money.

games, best, One of the best strategy games i've ever played. All im going to say is het this game. It is definetly worth the price.
commandos, best, One of the best commandos game.
mission, second, I was excited to play this on mobile, but on the second mission I found that once my soldiers go up a level, they're stuck there forever. Moving the camera up and down doesn't help.
player, single, Updating my review: multiplayer no longer works and 2k has stopped supporting it. This is fine for single player but for those of us who enjoy the multiplayer mode, it's disappointing how little they support their own game. Multiplayer was already extremely buggy to begin with but now we can't even start a multiplayer match.

game, Great, Great game, but it will crash every now and then so save and very often. Also, the tutorial crashes hard, so you might as well skip it
game, Best, Best TBS game!

game, best, The best strategy game on Android. Runs perfect on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e with Snapdragon 670 and 6 GB RAM, no framerate issues. Music sounds a bit low, though. Enemies are generally smart, and missions are challenging (even on Normal difficulty) but fair. I never felt like any loss of my squad members was anything but my own fault. Speaking of losing squad members, there is permadeath in this game, but it feels appropriate. I recommend this to anyone who wants to play a true strategy game.

implementation, Terrible, Terrible implementation. Game cannot save and crashes everytime! Awful I want my money back
download, failed, The app won't work. After installing it I open it, it starts some sort of download, it gives me a "failed download" notification and that's it. I contacted customer service and I heard nothing from them. I hope I can review this and give 5 stars in the future.
update, Awesome, Awesome update of the classic X-Com series updated for the PC and flawlessly ported to mobile. I've had no issues in the five years I've owned it, and I still play at least once a month. Worth it.

game, Great, Great game, almost as good as on PC but limited by mobile interface. 2 stars because it keeps giving me messages about not being connected to google cloud. I don't want any cloud junk! Just give me the game!

игра, Отличная, Отличная игра, приемлемые управление и графика. Русский язык. Минусов три: игра платная, реклама (в платной-то версии!!) и не работающие облачные сохранения.

game, abandoned, Graphics are great, game itself is on par with the Xbox360 version. However, cloud saving crashes (feels like a permission problem) and multiplayer is not functioning. Seems like an abandoned game.
startup, consistent, Unplayable because off consistent startup crashes
time, first, I love the game to death and all, but Im having this one issue where EVERY time the Sectopod uses a weapon, the app totally closes out. It was my first time seeing a sectopod, so I'm just really confused as to why this is happening
games, favorite, One of my favorite games ever, now in the palm of my hand. If you like X-Com 2 or Gears Tactics you'll like this.
game, Great, Great game for other platforms... definitely works poorly on mobile devices. Extremely difficult to use control interface for things like climbing to different floors of buildings. Eventually makes some missions effectively unplayable, which in turn makes the game nigh impossible to win.

setting, normal, For the price of the game its really good but frustrating to play. Sometimes you play a level and your on normal setting but its like your on hard setting. The big problem for me is the save and load game it doesnt work and that is really annoying, iv had to restart the game 5 times now and lose everything you worked for. Now iv got to start from the begining yet again. Only 2 stars just cos of the save and load game problem i would gladlie give it a solid 4 star if that gets fixed, please fix.

versions, later, Should've read reviews before purchasing... Found it doesn't work properly on later versions of Android (I'm on 10) and crashes when starting a game. Managed to get it working on my old tablet but it's very slow (lollipop). Google play should be updated so it won't install on later devices, or fix the problem...

graphics, good, Amazing that the pc game was completely adapted for phones. Runs smoothly and has good graphics for a mobile game. It is unfortunate that not all the dlc are included

menu, main, I like the Game alot but i have some bug issue with the game. I can't resume the game on main menu (The Game quit spontaneously); also can't save the game on Clouds. Btw it also mentioned 'XCOM:EW This app was built for an older version of Android and may not work properly. Try checking for updates, or contact the developer." Any advice? Thank You 🙏

men, extra, Seriously, the difficulty even on normal is insane. There's a difference between making things difficult, and making them frustrating. Serious...I'm fighting about 15 exalt agent's..then they get reinforced two turns running with an extra 7 men...and your telling me that's normal? If I wanted a challenge like that then I would play on hard difficulty...I just wanted to play through the story. Guess I want coz they always seem to ramp up the difficulty so you can't get nowhere.

mission, first, So the first mission after the tutorialI'm no longer able to move one of my soldiers or attack or put him in OverWatch or do anything I literally cannot continue. If it was a free-to-play game or cheaper than it is it wouldn't be a big deal.

mission, second, I love XCOM! I've played through 1 & 2 and I'm looking forward to chimera squad. I thought I would purchase this game to occupy my time but the game was unplayed during the second mission. The function of raising the elevation of the camera or curser requires you to use two fingers to swipe up or down. After dozens and dozens of times, I was only able to accomplish this action 1 time and I know this would be a reoccurring issues I couldn't live with.

end, dead, Ruined by no restart mission option. I love these games but miss a save or have it not load (and it OFTEN wont) you can easily watch days of play head down a dead end. Cloud save will randomly load old games. I have one now from years ago, my current no win possible save and a save from a few days ago. AI decide which level they want to be. Right now they never miss. My guys are missing barns. My last playthrough was not like this. Movement needs a take back option for touchscreens.

times, several, Love the game it's really good but with the multiplayer why is the saying that I'm not able to connectwe can be playing at one day or a few matches and then we'll sit there and say that I can't connect to a phone friendship trying to fix the bugswhy is multiplayer saying my account does not work when I've used it several times for the multiplayer
system, newer, It was good when it worked. Since my phone updated to a newer operating system, the game will no longer run. It attempts to download a patch but there is not patch available. I'd like my account refunded.

game, magnificent, Payed only 5.49$ for this magnificent game — on Xbox Live it was 19.99$. Best turn based strategy game @ Google Play. Played through the game multiple times and never needed to make in game purchases. And I'm very happy to see no graphical difference between my Xbox 360 and my Smartphone (Umidigi A5 Pro Phone). Only disadvantage is that it has less maps than the Xbox version. Big thanks to the developers

maps, less, Payed only 5.49$ for this magnificent game — on Xbox Live it was 19.99$. Best turn based strategy game @ Google Play.

game, Amazing, Amazing game. Comparable to the 360 Xbox version. Ran well on my generic LG that I purchased this year. Four stars instead of five because they used up all of my available space on my phone and my phone doesn't allow me to utilize SD card for saving apps

game, perfect, It's a wholly ported over game. Works fantastic. Great at what it is supposed to do. On my phone and offline too. Just the perfect game for xcom fans until xcom 2 on the the phone comes out. Hopefully. Lol

port, favourite, It pains me to say this, but on android 10, it is currently unplayable. Buttons won't work, camera controls won't respond, movement orders become locked or impossible. Please fix this, it's easily a 5 star game, and used to be my all-time favourite port on android.
port, Bad, Bad port. No updates. Very dissatisfied.
update, new, Plss make a new update sir
experience, incredible, An incredible Xcom experience on your phone! Have played through both PC titles and am so impressed with how well this translates. Sure, movement can be a little tricky with these fat fingers, but it's compelling and ultra addictive. Go shoot some aliens in the face.

maps, more, Love it. Made me play xcom 2 on ps4. Would really enjoy if you added more maps or like a random skirmish mode, but with a seperate thing that lets you unlock troops/level up/ customize like a rpgish vibe, but my main input would be to add more characters and make it more customizable like adding more stuff for troops or make it more detailed like intsad of just armor you can change the hat torso and legs. Just more in depth i would even pay if it was addons. Sorry for the grammar.

problem, small, Games awesome on the campaign I really love it I bought it twice one from my phone and one for my girl there's a small problem with the multiplayerI like how if we're interrupted in the game we can still go back and finish it without having to redo everythingto set it up but sometimes you won't be able to move your characters my girl had it to where she couldn't move two of her teammates it'll just skip her turns if you keep please fix this bug I really do appreciate it I love this game thank u
port, great, A great port over from consoles. Love being able to play this game one the go now
time, long, XCOM is awesome. Sadly this port has not been updated in a long time so the app crashes randomly. This is usually a few missions in so it gives you a false hope that you will be fine. For me it crashes at the beginning of a mission on the second month. Really got my hopes up, I started two games to make sure it can be reproduced. Both times it was a different map so that's not even a specific one. I will update my review if this is fixed.

fun, much, I tried playing this on my phone and it was buggy as hell and unplayable. 1*. Then I played it on a tablet and it worked fine. The game is great. So much fun to play and kept me guessing. 5*
devices, mobile, The game itself is what's on the box, this is xcom ported pretty damn well to mobile devices, could use an update so it keeps it working for newer devices however other than a lack of updates this is just what I wanted and what I'm happy I paid for. 8/10 solid port

game, Best, Best game ever. Thankyou for bringing this on android. Craving for more.
version, older, It runs well and is a lot of fun, but bear in mind this port hasn't been updated in basically three years. It will give you a warning on startup that it was made for an older version of Android, and it will refuse to connect to Google play or allow cloud saves. Local saves still work, though. If it were updated to allow continued use of Google play services I would give it five stars, but without that three is all it gets.

way, first, Played the very first PC game way back when, have to say this is a very good port. Only gripe is I am having trouble moving my characters up and down levels. Other than that it's very enjoyable.

phone, large, A bit clunky to play with a touchscreen, but if you have a tablet, or a relatively large phone, then it should be fine. Otherwise a great port of XCOM.

tablet, new, EDIT: Year later, new tablet with 4Gb RAM running smooth. Uses between 500Mb-1Gb memory, so 1Gb of FREE RAM is a hard minimum requirement. Doesn't have Slingshot or Progeny questlines, which I really liked on PC. Misses the option to turn off the Enemy Within expansion content like you can on PC. My problem with the DLC is mostly because how rubbish and easy the whole EXALT "questline" is after aliens. Still, a great game, and a very good port, considering it's a real PC game originally.

port, mobile, Put hundreds of hours into this, a mobile port for this turns out to work really well. customization for all of your soldiers, from what weapon they use to what color their armor is you make the decisions in this game. The only issue I've had is sometimes it's hard to control whether you want a troop on high ground or low ground. Ik there's a button that controls elevation but even at the right elevation sometimes I tap through the ceiling of a building and my sniper dashes through and dies. 🤷

port, great, Could you fix the crashes that occur on Samsung Galaxy A8 2018 devices? Other wise the game is amazing, a great port. Port XCOM 2 maybe wink wink?
runs, wrong, Its xcom can never go wrong runs well. But I have noticed a lot of the cut scenes are missing from the game not a big deal guess they gotta save space somewhere. The big deal is the games touch controls. They are abysmal beyond belief. Like wow this game has a hard time with them and it gets worse on multilevel and elevation maps. If you can stand the infuriating touch control I would say get it.

If you can stand the infuriating touch control I would say get it.
controls, unable, Trash controls unable to select rooms in the ship during the tutorial making it unplayable and that's a shame this game is amazing on every other platform

port, great, It's a great port. But I can't play it. Whenever I play a mission and kill every alien the mission doesn't end. And I can't climb on roof
strategy, much, Not much strategy in it. Just a dice roll in every turn. Quite a laughable design. A must for masochists! Missed. Missed. Missed...

thing, only, It's still XCOM but very slow and cumbersome. Everything about the touch controls is hard to use in mission. Selecting the abilities is about the only thing that I don't regularly have trouble with. But at the end of the day it's still turn based so as long as you're careful and learn the tricks the cumbersome controls don't ultimately matter and the game that is here is a modern classic. The pros of being able to play such an amazing game on my phone vastly outweighs the cons

port, good, A good port with a couple of minor quirks. Sometimes the game crashes when trying to resume a game but brute forcing it eventually works. Targetting tiles and using explosives can also be weird at times but it's not game ruining

work, Amazing, Amazing work adapting this gem to mobile!
save, manual, Works with android 10. Watch out with the resume button (autosave) as it often doesn't work and you lose your game if you don't have a manual save. Even though you can save manually at any time this is ridiculous for a paid product. When I didn't play for a year my game wouldn't run but after reinstalling it the game and saves were fine. Too bad there are some bugs like this but the game is still great and it's actually a real game unlike most shallow stuff that is on phones and tablets.

saves, local, THAT'S XCOM BABY! I can't complain. It's an old Port that doesn't seem to be supported anymore, but it still works on my Pixel 3xl with Android 10. It crashes when I try to save to cloud, but local saves still work. It's a legit, full Port, not a dumbed down version. It lends itself well to touch screens. I just wish there were more turn based tactics games of this quality on mobile. Maybe Port XCOM 2? Something!

shame, real, Buggy as all hell. Cant perform any actions, can't cancel actions, crashes constantly. Couldn't get a refund either. A real shame too because I love the xcom series, but this level of buggyness makes it unplayable. Avoid

game, great, This game is absolutly killer. I had it on my 360, but now I can take it anywhere on my phone. Kudos to the developers on all xcom games, this one especialy. Such a great stratagy game. WELL worth the money hand down completely.
plot, Great, Absorbing gameplay. Great plot. Wonderful attention to detail. Hours of play.

apps, more, I have purchased this app b4 in the iphone. Loved it. Just bought it for android but wont download. Keep saying I need to delete apps to make room . Despite already having the room and deleting more apps it still wont download. I really love this game and hope this can be resolved and I can give this a proper 5 star review. Thank you

range, blank, First of all, at point blank range, 86% chance of hitting the target- with a shotgun, and the experienced soldier misses???? These people cant shoot ANYTHING! Ive been an xcom player for 20 years and love this game and concept - BUT- Man, ... These "soldiers" should be expected to do 'a little bit better' at least. Love the game, graphix, concept and all- but these people couldnt hit the broad side of a barn if you gave them an atomic bomb for gee wizz sake! Holy sheesh.....

game, epic, This is an epic game!
bit, tiny, Takes a lot of battery and is a tiny bit buggy every now and then, and also doesn't have as much customization options or a lot of the cinematic combat. It more than makes all of that up by being excellent in every other way though, and is overall an excellent port to mobile.

port, full, XCOM: Enemy Within for mobile is a diamond in the rough. It's a full port of XCOM Enemy Unknown with the Enemy Within DLC and translates well to mobile devices. The camera controls are a bit wonky at times, but it's easier to figure out over time. This game works flawlessly on my Motorola Z3 and it's a great game to pass the time.

example, prime, This is a prime example of how to port a game correctly. All the elements of the original are there. The UI is functional. Yes, you need suitable hardware to run it, and a dev can't account for every iteration of Android. But if it really isn't working on your device, that's why the refund button is there. Pick it up for cheap on PC or Console.

games, best, One of the best games on my phone. Once you learn the controls for camera views and height movement it becomes very intuitive. I will not play it on Iron Man settings as your shots tend to miss more often than their % indicates. I chalk this up to trying to make the game more challenging for masochistic players who need that extra frustration. A great game.

game, good, Really good strategic topdown squad management game. I was impressed with the depth this game has, the story is amazing, but I cannot get past the ridiculous aiming percentage and expensive upgrades, 20 days to build a satellite, really?Overall, the game is very good, hence the 4 stars.

mission, 2nd, This game game hangs dead on 2nd mission! This bug even migrated from consoles and PC. I work in IT myself and I say WHOEVER DECIDED TO IGNORE IT SHOULD DIE HORRIBLY
strategy, based, Excellent turn based strategy
screen, black, Apparently my rating got deleted! Game is bugged and unplayable, just get a black screen with a HUD and the main menu isn't even all in view... want to get a refund for this

tile, right, It's difficult to select the right tile, select the right soldier, it's just difficult to play on mobile.

game, tactical, Unplayable, the elevation controls are broken, this being a tactical game renders it useless. How do I get a refund?
scenes, cut, I've been playing for 2 days and in my experience. This game is amazing packed with missions decision making and stretgic gameplay. The fight scenes are great and the cut scenes are among the best if not the best ive seen in a mobile game. I strong approve of this game.

game, Fantastic, Fantastic game for PC. Works pretty well on mobile devices too. However even using the latest hardware (Galaxy S10) it cranks up the temperature of the phone really fast (mine reached around 40°C), which makes me think this is more suited to tablets (larger thermal dissipation area) if you want to keep your battery intact for more than a year. I don't know that the game could be more optimized for mobile devices, so I'll just give it five stars. But, beware!

issues, Excellent, Excellent game.a few issues, but gonna try not to rehash other comments. You have to make a mobile version of the second xcom or just add a bunch of "consumer friendly" dlc(maps, characters, etc) to this game. I'd buy all of it lmao. I wish the ranger class was in this game.

game, best, The best stratagy game i have EVER played !!!😎
phone, new, Love it on my tablet. Trying to download it to my new phone. Having some troubles.
logos, animated, Opening the game takes twenty minutes while it forces you to watch animated logos of every company whose ever touched the game and their mother and her cousins. Then half the time attempting to resume results in a crash, which means you get to watch the opening again!
thing, only, This is the game that I was looking for. Guns, action, and a lot more. The only thing that I putted three stars for this is when the enemy gets so strong. And when you lost the game. You will start all over again its just so boring doing all you just did. I'm sorry for putting three stars
errors, repeated, Love the game on PC. Downloads. Shows repeated errors when opening. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and tried tinkering with permissions. Still doesnt work. Can't recommend a game that doesn't work. Can't get refund.

round, next, Game is incomplete, you're supposed to have the ability to revive/stabilize troops that are downed. Once you stabilize them you are supposed to be able to carry them to extraction. You can stabilize them, but you cant carry them, and even if you eliminate all hostiles in the AO you should get them back since you stabilized them, they're counted as KIA no matter what you do with them and you lose them. Also, autosave is set when one of your troops is killed or at the start of the next round.

problem, major, The game is great but there is one major problem the scroll speed for the maps is severely under sensitive if I want to go from one part of the map to another it can take about 10 swipes which is kind of ridiculous. Is there a mod or a setting that I have missed to fix this problem that makes it nearly unplayable

menu, main, Unable to play, can't start on Android 9, just hangs after clicking anything in the main menu
mission, First, Poorly updated. First mission after the tutorial and one of my characters was bugged trying to attack enemies that weren't there. Having to save and reload every turn got old when the Character was bugged the same way, the next turn. Lots of potential but disappointing implementation.

Such a shame as I am a long time fan of the series and this looks good and started to play well until I saved and came back to it, pretty disgusted by this.

reason, only, Could not install to my moto g5 or my android 8.1 MT-107. Loving the pc version is the only reason i am rating this attempted purchase. I would need to see how the controls are with a cell phone and/or tablet then i could rate this game higher.
