makes, after, couple, Always a fan of kairosoft games. This one took a while to get the mechanics of it, but after a couple of play throughs, it makes sense. One of the better games. Fast mode is too fast.
lock, in, position, Awesome game. Would like name customization to be a bit longer. The ability to lock a player in a certain position would be nice to, easier to rotate the team that way. Pitchers in relief also do significantly worse than leaving a tired starter in. Small things. Great game though.
runs, at, fps, Love kairosoft games but this one runs at extremely low fps on my galaxy fold 3, unplayable

like, about, company, This game is very good and if you like watching your players perform excellent this is the game to play. The only thing I do not like about this gaming company is they do not have a american football high school or college game. Everything else I love keep up the good work and make that game
want, from, me, Whart all so you want from me huh i mispelled what on purpose
mispelled, on, purpose, Whart all so you want from me huh i mispelled what on purpose
m, on, newgame+, Not much a fan of baseball but this is a fun long game. Im on newgame+ 8 and still havent beaten S rank tournaments.
making, like, this, This game has been one of the most exciting games I have ever played I just want the summer series I was training my team to be the best that can be and all the hard work finally paid off I really enjoy this game very much probably one of my favorites I hope you guys keep making more games just like this I would really love if you guys made a football game of this I would honestly buy it all your games are amazing keep up the hard work hope you guys keep making amazing games just like this.

played, for, weeks, I didn't particularly enjoy baseball before buying this game but after having played it for the last two weeks i can say I've gained a much better appreciation for baseball and it's strategies. The game is designed well and is just purely fun to play. I got invested in my players and when they graduated i was always bummed to see em go. My only complaint is your team never starts 2nd and no home field. The game was so enjoyable that I'll have to check out some more games from this developer.

came, in, clutch, I won the summer tournament 9 - 8. It was the 9th inning with the other team on third base 2 outs, 2 strikes, and 3 balls. Thought the enemy batter would get a homerun to win the game but my pitcher Bob Man came in clutch and struck him out. 10/10 would get a heart attack again.

play, in, tournaments, Love this Game however I have noticed that in the tournaments when it says who you are playing next and 2ho you play next don't always show the same opponent. Other then that it's a great game
use, in, game, Amazing game it is fun to play and you hqve to use stratogy in the game you n3ed to make sure players are both good at their position and like it to u also have to look at batting and training its more fun then i expected though it seems a bit expensive

threw, like, land, I enjoy all your games. I think generally if you did get cloud save or one app to access all games threw it like a kario land. It will over all improve but who cares games are awesome. Keep making what people want. I see you do. We appreciate it.
get, in, game, Great game you get a a lot of small details you wouldn't normally get in a mobile game Ive lost many hours to this game definitely worth the asking price

knocking, with, games, Kairosoft and baseball turns out to be a wonderful combination. Always knocking out of the park with their games, this here is another example of the greatness their games deliver on.
start, from, 0, This game is amazing and I really like this. But I think it could be better. It could allow you to save data so you don't have to start from 0 again after you reinstall. New Game + it's amazing. However, as I said before, a cloud save would be awesome. Keep up the good work!
buy, for, fans, The game is great and a huge time waster! Controls could use some reworking though. Still a must buy for fans of managing teams. Even if you're not a baseball fan you'd enjoy this game. I feel like the XP you gain from training sometime isn't enough. Does become a grind to improve players.

move, through, dialog, +:It's a good Kairosoft game. If you like most of their older games, you'll like this one too. -:The amount of tapping needed to move through the dialog is a bit much. And the amout of time between two matches is way to short. So you'll have to hurry with everything you do if you have a tournament running+friendlies.

playing, during, series, Back to form for Kairosoft, great game, solid development. Only thing that is kinda wonky is the third years really only playing during summer series then leaving. Beating the game in the allotted time is very tough but doable

make, For, game, For a mobile game, it sure does make you sweat. In a good way. A great way actually.
listened, on, request, Love the new game concepts coming out. If I may recommend some more after ya'll listened on my tennis version request. I would be amazed if you made some wrestling/sumo game with goofy throw/ body slam animations. There are tons of sumo rankings and size isn't all it takes to be a top tier yokozuna. A swimming game could be unique and simple for those who like aquatic style sports (Diving, Swimming). I woul be down for a basketball story game that could relate to the anime Slam Dunk or Kuroko

Buy, at, risk, I usually love Kairosoft but this game freaking blows. Its incredibly slow, like more so than usual, there is zero playability. Buy at your own risk, not going to do a refund because i enjoy a lot of the other games these guys make but i mean this one is just terrible.
ask, for, review, Fantastic way to ask for a review
continue, into, sports, They should continue this format into other sports I'll pay for it!!

do, with, hockey, Great game. You should do the same with hockey. Hockey hockey please. Hockey
play, in, burst, Loved the game. Addictive and can play in short burst.
took, in, beginning, in the beginning its difficult and sometimes frustrating but it took me 5 game yrs to win the Summer Series. great game overall.

stayed, on, game, Worth the download. I have never stayed on a mobile game as much as I have stayed playing this.
playing, on, train, Not even a fan of sports and I still loved playing this on the train.
comes, in, game, I've enjoyed every paid Kairosoft game I've ever played. This is no exception. Simple mechanics, challenging and compelling gameplay, fun characters, and lots of replayability comes in this game.
stuck, to, guns, This game is yet another amazing one from kairosoft.  I recommend every game they've ever developed.  I love how they have stuck to their guns and have not placed in app purchases on any of their games you pay for.  5 stars every time.

get, in, game, Overall it's fun, but there's a severe imbalance when it comes to facing teams that are about on par with you or slightly better. I would expect to lose more often than not, but usually you just get slaughtered. This would only be a moderate problem if you didn't need to beat those better teams to get most of the better players.   Never being the home team needs to be fixed. Baseball is the only sport where the home team has a significant rules advantage, and you never get it in this game.   Training players requires too many points. It also requires way too much investment to get to the top levels of your school stats. In game power-ups rarely seem to be worth it. I hate the game's decision making when it comes to bunting, because I never want to bunt. The game is very inconsistent when identifying clutch moments.

used, to, things, Once you get used to all the things going on at once it's really fun
tie, in, baseball, So apparently you can can tie in baseball???
go, from, school, It is a very fun game, but you should make a second one where you make a MLB team or you go from High school to the MLB as a coach or manager, that would be pretty cool

play, with, lot, It's simple to play with a lot of depth and a ton of that Kairosoft charm. Simply awesome!
loved, by, Kairosoft, It's just not very fun. I've loved many games by Kairosoft but this one doesn't have much gameplay or interactivity.
disappointed, with, game, You can never be disappointed with a game from Kairosoft. They are the best in my opinion.
launch, on, shield, 1 star because for some reason it is the only kairosoft game that gives me an error on start up and fails to launch on my Nvidia shield. It works fine on my phone but this rating stands until it's fixed on my tablet.

bring, on, game, Awesome game.. Wish u could pick starting nine you bring back on new game plus but really fun.. Maybe update and add that but great game
spend, on, game, I love all if the Kairosoft games, not to mention for me to spend $5 on a game on my phone is almost unheard of but I've boughten almost all of them now. I would love to see them make a football one or maybe like a Boxing one that would be fun to see. Thanks again developers much appericate you ladies and gentlemen for takeing almost all of my free time  hahaha
come, with, version, Great game wish they would come out with a football and basketball version
let, in, mind, love it. i have 22 kairo titles that dont let me down in mind numbing fun and this is one of them. days off go fast with great games like this. too bad theres been less fun filled games as of late

expected, from, kairosoft, Great game as always as you expected from kairosoft!
get, through, play, Takes a long time to get through first play through. Once you beat first time game moves quickly and progress happens quickly.
want, from, simulation, What I want from a Kairosoft simulation that has sports in it.
Reminds, of, time, It definitely follows the pattern of a Kairosoft game, which can sometimes feel tired, but I've really enjoyed their sports games. Reminds me of the first time with their soccer sim. Very well worth the money.
get, with, players, I think the game is good but, losing your members really takes the fun out of it.  I feel like I don't get enough time with my players to really make a dominating team.  Which would be great if the game was more interactive.  However the entire premise of the game is to watch your n00bs become pros.  So when you lose them it's like what's the point of play?  It would've been amazing otherwise. 4/5
start, as, C, Honestly, yea I lose players. But they actually return sometimes better as a COACH think of it in a better way. You need to train first stringers. I work team A as Year 1 (they start as Team C). Each year, I move the players up. I only train Team C for 2 years.  Team C winds up better than Team A and has the ratings needed to succeed. I do this in all renditions of the team. In year 7 my current team has a S rating while my B team is A and my C team is C.  Its all about your priorities. You will not succeed early and this game is FINALLY what Kairosoft had been striving for. Balance in game and Quality of Life for players.  I can get a million hours out of this game and just be happy with the sheer work I have to put in to make my team better.

face, in, playoffs, Fun baseball game. There's an issue with having to face a team twice in the playoffs though.
expect, from, kairo, Exactly what you expect from kairo soft
come, For, people, Great game. For the people who say it's frustrating that you have to restart training players again, they come back as freshman. You have to go two cycles through and then you will start seeing your old players return.

Using, for, boost, Awful. There is literally no point in winning because you get better rewards for losing!! Using cheer point for a boost will have no effect 87% of the time. It's really really bad. Hope you enjoyed leveling up your players because they are gone in four years and you get to start over. Just a sad game.

get, at, times, Similar to other kairosoft games, can get frustrating at times with players leaving every 3 years and having to train new sets of players but all around fun experience.

love, since, game, I love Kairosoft game since their first game, Game Dev Story. This game is awesome, but managing and making your player became pro is rather hard, but that's where the fun relies.
listened, about, game, So, I love that i was listened to about this game. I wanted it in English. This game is pretty good. My suggestion, it should be 4 year terms. High school is 4 years, for us in the US. And i just noticed a bug that cost me in the realm of 30,000 G. I went to place an object and didn't want it. When I put it back, I lost that money!

complaining, about, years, Starts slow but gets pretty grindy later on. For people complaining about 3rd years leaving, this is a High School baseball sim so it makes sense. Spoilers, some of the 3rd years do come back as 1st years in later years. So you can still focus on building up a group of players and wait for them to return.   Great game by Kairosoft, as long as you invest in learning all of its mechanics.

hit, during, bottom, Really good and fun two problem for me my team never gets to hit on during the bottom of an inning always giving the advantage to cpu
Agreing, with, others, Agreing with others about the "build up players who then leave and you have to start over" hurts the game. Reminds me of some mediocre Kairosoft games of the past with similar mechanics. Like the horse racing one. Artificially extended grinding hurts games, and unlike Pocket Academy or Dream House Days, your 'players' aren't recycled, at least as far as I've seen.  Would be better if it was more like Pocket League or the tennis spinoff.  A swing and a miss, I guess. Better luck next time, Kairo.

locked, in, orientation, The game itself is pretty fun. but it is locked in landscape orientation all the time.  Not only that but you cannot flip the screen 180 degrees to the opposite orientation.  This is a huge annoyance when playing with it charging, but the charging port is on the wrong side for your charger.  And along with the recent trend in Kairosoft games, this game also turns off your music player when you open it.  I also think it would be better if this was pro baseball instead of high school.  I's kind of annoying that you build up players, but only have them for three years.  Early in the game it is very difficult to recover after your third years graduate and leave.

This is a huge annoyance when playing with it charging, but the charging port is on the wrong side for your charger.
