rated, in, hopes, I love this game so much, but I rated one star in hopes of the dev seeing it, I just downloaded the game but when I closed it, all of my progress was deleted. Is this a known bug? Edit: Changed to 5 stars, I found out that my progress was deleted because I had the game on my SD card, it worked properly when I switched to my internal storage

waiting, for, 2.2, I love this game just waiting for 2.2 is so boring.
widen, by, blocks, It's good and all but the deadlocked wave 3x speed wave is so hard... Could you please just widen by 0.5 blocks. If you could thanks in advance
work, for, reason, I love this game! It's so fun and there is so many things to do, but the J blocks don't work for some reason, other than that great game!
changed, in, music, I'm just gonna paraphrase my Steam review: This game changed my taste in music. 👍👍👍
wait, for, 2.2, This game is my full on child hood. Since I got the full game, I having a bunch load of fun making levels and raging many times. I can't wait for 2.2 I hope robtop realsess it soon. I'm will be here waiting... For now
get, at, one, To be honest this game is really good but if anyone's going to play this game let me tell you that the games that are on there are very hard but once you get good at one it's kind of fun
wait, for, 2.2, The classic rage game. Nothing more to be said. Cant wait for 2.2.
teaches, along, way, Amazing game, smooth gameplay and great graphics. The game is fun, and teaches you along the way. Notes:1 Pay attention to the music. When it speeds up often you'll speed up. 2 The game doesnt back up save data, so if you unisnstall it you will lose your data. Finally 3 The games ment to be challenging. Also try looking closely at when your tapping the screen, to make sure your tapping at the right time

played, for, years, What an amazing game, I have played on and off for 4 years and honestly I don't have any complaints. I urge everyone interested to play this game because it is addictive, fun and rewarding. It will leave you obsessed for years. Highly recommend 👌

grew, with, it, To be honest I grew up with it to and this was from the first message that is on the top same and yes it's kinda hard but fun :)
got, on, phone, All I can say is.. bad. I love geometry dash, but when I got it on this phone, I opened it and one of the permissions as make and manage phone calls? I don't think that is needed. And, once I tried to play, it wouldn't register my taps, and I KNOW I tapped the screen correctly. Is this because I turned off one permission? What? I'm so confused. I could only get to about 56% of the first level before I stopped to think about this. Robtop, please, do atleast SOMETHING about this! Please!

rid, of, one, I got a demon key from a chest and then it got rid of one of my demon keys which is the only one I had! 😡
get, through, levels, Really fun gaming experience, offers a simple way of just tapping your screen/mouse to get through levels that range from the difficulty of Stereo Madness to user levels like Firework and Slaughterhouse. Would recommend for sure if you want a fun relax, the music is really good. If you want to stay motivated to beat harder levels, make jumps but not to big jumps, like Sakupen hell to Kenos (I'm looking at you SpeedyMuffin). There are many great content creators on YouTube and Twitch. Have fun!

playing, for, years, I love the game I have been playing for five years I really like the game so dis rating is my opinion if you have a different opinion I rstcp that :)
occupied, for, time, Great game but other than that the hit boxes are great as well it's a great game no ads and it keeps you occupied for a long time I can't stop playing perfect gamei got a few more ideas tho 1st is a new cube that is much like the space ship but a 2.0 2nd is a cube for the shot I'd say for it about 2000-3000 for it it's high tech and has a glowing trail. That's mostly it for my ideas but good game.i have one more cube its a cube just like the jumping one but you can stay up it the air longer.

played, for, years, This game is so fun, I've played it for now over 5 years and I'm still not bored of it. So much stuff to do. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we've been waiting for 2.2 for over 4 years.

add, to, Library, Unable to add to Family Library and no update since 2017. Leads me to believe the developer is AWOL and MIA
CAUSE, TO, JUMP, I LOVE GEOMETRY DASH 'CAUSE ITS FUN TO JUMP & I LIKE MAKING LEVELS TOO!
show, in, play, It's good but the problem is that I don't have the newer version of gd it says I need to update it but I doesn't show in Google play so I was wondering that what's going on
got, after, days, I liked the game, but it got bored after a few days and I don't like it anymore. How do I get refund
ask, for, much, This is a great game which I played all the time around 4 years ago. I decided to try playing it again so I bought the game. I wouldn't ask for much and just want to play it normally, but the game doesn't even fit the screen of my Samsung S10. This made me resort to using full screen settings from the settings app which just makes the game FPS lag so much. Disappointing that the developers can't even do a bug/quality of life update.

played, for, years, I'v played thid game for 6 years now and its the best game out there
playing, for, time, I love this but... Well there is a giant bug that removed almost all of my levels I made and I am super upset about it. It happened when I installed after not playing for a long time. I was already logged in so I refreshed my save and went to my levels and all my hard work was gone. Was nearly reduced to tears. However, this doesn't seem to happen when you play often so no worries there... Anyway great game, I love it, ROBTOP GIVE US 2.2 AND ILL GIVE 5 STARS, FIX THE BUG AND ILL GIVE 4!

bought, with, orbs, Why can you not return the items that people bought with orbs
get, for, example, Overall, I love the game! But there's a bug, and it drives me crazy. The bug is whenever I play a level, and I get for example, 51% on Jumper. When I pass 51% and get 88, I leave the game and it goes back to 51! It's really annoying. Could you try to fix this please?
say, With, Beaten, With 500 Demons Beaten I can say this is the best mobile game ever made
dying, in, way, Good game, however so many more faults than the lite game, and I've been dying in way I never have before, which frustrates me. If they had just kept it the same as the lite and fixed the differences, then this would have a five star review.
love, for, myself, I love this game, love creating levels for myself and others 10/10
playing, for, week, The day that I got this I couldn't stop playing it for like almost a whole entire week that how much I love this game it has good gameplay even though hexagon forces so hard for me but keep it up rubrub.

grew, with, it, I love this game, especially seeing as I kinda grew up with it. However, I think there may be some sorta glitch or bug or somethin', cuz I can't seem to use some of the more recent newgrounds songs (by smaller artists, I mean). Like, I've been trying to make a level using a song from a creator I like (check out korewakosu you'll love it 😘) but it seemed to just cut off the last digit when I put in the ID for the song. Other than that, 5 outta 5 would recommend!

play, on, mobile, AMAZING GAME! (Although weird bug for me) The Bug Is That, I dont play on mobile anymore, so I went to my computer and tried to get in, but it kept saying Game already running. I went to steam support, but it wasn't much help. So now I'm here, it hasn't been working for 3 days. Did something happen to my account?

grow, around, platform, Even though everytime I die, I still find a way to finish every level I find. I do recommend this game to people who want a challenge. Or this game can give you a chance to grow famous around this platform.
get, to, game, There is so much that is good about this game from the vast array of user created levels that get better every day to the fun game play that everything offers. I've had this game for 6 years and grown up with it and it is still refreshing and fun to play, best $2 I've ever spent hands down

waiting, on, 2.2, It took me 4 years but I finally beat every main Robtop level and waiting on 2.2 like everyone else. The only reason why I'm not rating 5 stars is because of update scarcity. Robtop should just use the beta feature on Steam and Android if an update isn't out yet. Minecraft does it. This way we won't have to wait years for an update.

Bringing, with, ratings, Bringing the game with ratings down until the update comes out, simple.
play, with, friends, My favorite game of all time. Can be fun to play along with friends (no multiplayer), challenge yourself with difficult levels, relax by building your very own levels, and meet plenty of great community members along the way. I've had over 10,000 hours of fun with this game, and I'm still going strong.

played, like, year, i havent played this game in like a year, and 2.2 still isnt out. i know, it takes a long time to make, im sorry. this game is really cute, awesome, blah blah blah, but the reason i give three stars is cuz how long it takes to save, load, and how delayed the reaction time is. three stars from me. no moi!
miss, with, game, You can't miss with this game
played, from, start, I've had and played these game from the start and I gotta say it's one of the best games ice ever played

commented, on, game, I rated this one star intentionally to tell all of you that commented on this game that it's not good/not reccomendable that you SUCK 'cause 1.)

You can now regret it with this non-refundable app or better yet just play it and stop whining

You just have a device that sucks 'cause it's old 2.) y'all clamour to robtop that this game's too hard and 3.) that it requires internet to access daily reward 4.) and requests for a refund? You can now regret it with this non-refundable app or better yet just play it and stop whining

deleted, from, devices, All of the geometry dash app got deleted from so many people's devices. I don't know if this was a server issue, but I hope everything is good. Please, I need an answer about what happened. Thanks for lost progress.
downloaded, on, device, I gave this a 1 star because my main geometry dash account was automatically logged out and is it because i downloaded this gsme on this device?
built, for, version, Cool game and i used to play it a lot and it is really fun but it says it's built for a older version and is slightly offset which is annoying and a really easy fix
blend, into, background, Really good game but some times things blend into background
paid, for, game, I paid for the game and i can't play, well done!!
playing, for, years, i've been playing this game for years now and while it is a hard game like a lot of people said, it is still a fun yet addictive game...
becomes, with, practice, Awesome there are so many levels and rewards the game is kinda hard but with practice it becomes easier
had, with, it, THIS GAME IS very challenging and addicting. IT also has great music. Never had probe with it
had, since, release, I've had this game probably since release now, but there's an issue with the daily chest where it says "something went wrong" when I go to open it and I have no choice but to back out and wait for the timer to open it again without getting my rewards.
play, For, reason, Great game! Super fun! For some reason though, i cant play online levels
played, for, years, Great game, played for years
get, from, missions, Its a fun game but I have a glitch where I can't collect daily chests and can't get diamonds from missions.
type, into, bar, Good, but really annoying glitch where if I type four characters or more into the search bar, it comes up with nothing.
comes, with, nothing, Good, but really annoying glitch where if I type four characters or more into the search bar, it comes up with nothing.

fix, In, dollar, In payed 2 dollar for a game that deletes all my progress each time I exit the game, fix this. Please
click, on, level, I know I'm way late to the party, however there is a bug on my app that whenever I click on a level for the first attempt it hurls me fast at the first obstacle. It only does it on the first attempt so not much trouble there, but I just wanted to say something. Anyway, super fun game!! I hope they update again!!

coming, with, idea, This game is perfect except for the Creator option it is so hard to delete things and it's hard just coming up with an idea. " * _ * " but except for that it's a good game I really enjoy the demon 😈 levels this is such a good game 🎮 thanks for creating this game
helps, with, memory, This game is so fun while your bored and it helps you with muscle memory
installed, on, device, Pretty much all my stuff is gone. I re-installed this on another device but like 1/5th of my stuff is gone and all my demons are gone. It's not that i havent saved because i have messages on that game from when i had 8 demons. I litterslly said pretty much this: "im 8 demons in and can't find any more easy demons that're actually easy". And i have apparently 0 demons. So if that messagr saved from when i had 8 demons it clearly shows at least that much has saved but still i have no demons
take, to, 2.2, I like this game the music is great some levels are amazing like bloodlust firework and kenos but this game has problems 1 the updates take to long 2.2 is out now but it nearly took 4 years 2 some levels are good and then there's conical depression it's an ugly level with very out dated decoration and not that fun gameplay 3 if you play on mobile some levels like the yandere are laggy as hell sure there's a low detail mode but still it kinda sucks this game is good but it as flaws I like it 🙂👍

work, on, Clubstep, Loved this game I passed 17 out of 21 need to work on Clubstep, toe 2, deadlocked, Electrodynamix, and Hexagon force though.
playing, for, years, I really like this game and have playing for a little over 4 years now. I was reading some of the reviews, and seeing a lot of people saying they signed into their account on a new device or after deleting the app and losing all the progress. If you do that, after you sign back into your account you need to load your data back onto the device otherwise you won't have any progress.

get, like, music, I love this game so much, I just want to get better at the extreme demon "Idols" i like the music and all!
playing, with, apps, Really good gaming experience and the best part is that there isn't any ads or interruptions either, it's just that this game should lets us record sound while playing with third party recorder apps. Other than that it's one of the best games I have played ever
get, at, alot, To all of the people saying the first level of the game is impossible it's not my name in game is PunchAnOrphan and I am way better than probably anyone who has ever rated this game one star and said that the first level is impossible as I have beaten multiple extreme demon rated levels you just have to get good at the game practice alot
browse, through, levels, This game is top 5 of my games I love how you can browse through many levels and create your own I give 5 stars for the great quality to, just every thing about this game is great.
playing, for, years, I've been playing this game for 5 years now. Majority of it on mobile, now on PC (Steam). I find myself always coming back to it and I can never seem to get bored. Main downsides is that updates take a while, and that syncing account data is notoriously buggy (However there is almost always a way to do it), but we all love RobTop and know he is trying his best. A great game to test patience, reaction time, memory, and even train your brain to keep up with fast paced gameplay in most levels.

play, on, phone, Can't get back my account data. I used to play this game about 5 years ago on my old phone, however after installing this game on my new phone I am getting an error "Sync failed. Try again later" after trying to load saved data from the cloud. I would love to rate this game 5* after my issue is solved.

wait, for, 2.2, Amazing game, can't wait for 2.2 :)
get, for, future, I've been starting to play this in 5 years ago but this is a good game I can play I'm still undevelopment I will try to get better for my future soon
have, on, game, I have alot of fun on this game the increasing of difficulty is awsome and ik it gets repetitive bit this is prolly the best and most addictive mobile and pc game ever.
waiting, for, 2.2, This is by far one of the best mobile games. But there is only one bad thing and it's the update. It's been over 3 years that we have been waiting for 2.2 but they are taking forever. Please hurry up, it getting a bit boring now.
sign, into, account, Wouldn't let me sign into my account and I lost my progress so I'm raging but it's a good game my username is indominusrex23 but I want it to be pronix
put, in, more, I love the game but there's a bug where if you mess up the valet of secrets it won't let put the code in any more on phone

Spent, on, game, Spent over 4000 hours on a 4$ game. Love it.
beging, for, game, I was beging for the game
put, into, game, The devs really put effort into this game, barley lags and you can create your own maps offline (cant publish them) this game its really good if you like techno music games, even non techno cuz you can make your very own music
have, on, pixel, Would be 5 star if I were able to have a full screen on my Google pixel it's in like a small screen mode and I would very much like to have a full screen effect like on the lite versions thanks!...edit: I decided to uninstall this game but changed my mind 20 minutes later and now all my progress is now gone thanks robtop...
create, to, consent, I can create levels to my heart's consent so awesome levels are high detail and my kids love it😝
logged, into, account, Its a fun, simple, yet challenging game that you can learn and get better at. You never run out of content because ugl (user generated levels). There's one problem that I have. When I deleted the game on accident and I logged into my account after I downloaded it again, and I lost my progress and all my icons, All that stuff. I do still think it's a five star but I wish that was fixed. Good game that I recommend you try.
made, on, store, I've been playing Geometry Dash lite lately and have been really enjoying myself, so I went ahead and bought the full version. This was probably one of the best purchases I've made on the play store. Definitely recommend to anybody who thinks they enjoy GD lite a bit, it opens up a whole lot more content.

challenging, with, levels, This is a really fun game! The music is awesome, and it gets really challenging with some levels. I highly recommend this game!
played, on, tablet, This game is great, but there's a glitch, I played this on my old tablet a while ago, and made a really good level, I have a new tablet, but now, I want to move my old levels and the way I tried (making an account and signed in on both tablets, then merging the data, the sync failed). I can't even access the old levels on the old tablet, Is there any other way to move levels, and are the old levels just plain GONE??? (If this problem is resolved, I will change this review, and rate five stars).

Robtop, with, games, Robtop with all the other games you made I'm really hope you make another geometry dash game with all your five games well I don't know if you have really have five games like maybe you only have four and probably just pretending on YouTube so if I got that wrong I'll try to get it right if you're interested then I'll try to find out okay I don't have the table and if we have it it's just faking you you're probably just dummies I did not say that to you I'm just trying to make sure okay

played, for, years, Awesome game I love it I played it for around 5 years
got, into, account, Amazing game. The levels are very fun and challenging. I never lose any progress or icons. There are not that many ads, which is good because games like this would probably have tons of ads. I recommend this game if you like challenges. 100% worth the money. Edit: well, where do I even start? Well, a little bit earlier I got into my account and wanted to play. Right when I got on, I noticed that...all my progress was gone!! My icons, progress, and everything were gone! Went to 5 star to 1 star.

looking, for, game, This game is really great, it has addictive music and gameplay that will never run out. You will never truly finish the game because there are millions of user created levels which you can also create and play. If your looking for a hard game, this is the one. But at the same time it can be easy as you get better or just play easier levels. The game runs smoothly and has (from my perspective) no bugs. You can create your own custom character with unlockable colors, icons and other veichles.

get, from, me, I like this game a lot. Play it almost everyday, but there's this bug where it doesn't react when you touch the screen, and it reacts when I don't even touch the screen. Fix this bug and you get five stars from me.

spent, on, level, I spent over 24 hours straight on a level just for a tiny little glitch to make it impossible to go back and play the level or edit it, it is extremely frustrating for something you worked so hard on just to be taken away for a glitch and that same glitch also affected a lot more of my creations and my favorite part of gd is the level editor and I don't even wanna look or think about because of this extremely devastating glitch and there are 100+ more glitches and I'm not exaggerating

do, in, game, Its a great game and I mean a great game, just make sure you have plenty to do in the game or else it gets boring
play, on, mobile, Mobile is useless, if you play this on mobile I'm not sorry but you are plying on the worst possible platform. PC version is amazing however.

play, as, kid, I used to play this game as a kid and I used to rage out so hard than finally got the hang of it and I can now basically beat every level 1st try
played, for, years, I have played for several years and can say without a doubt this is one of my favorite games ever, it is more a mental game than a game of skill, do you rage and lose consistency? Or do you keep calm and beat the level? Its the kind of gameplay I really like. (Also the music is a jam)

playing, for, years, I've been playing this for like 4 years or something stupid. Here's all you need to know: The game is very hard, but quite fun. You'll constantly want to beat harder and harder levels, until they're incredibly difficult. The editor is pretty good and you can make unique levels using with lots of depth and amazing designs. The community is great even with all the bad that comes with it. Your definition of "soon" will change with 2+ year gaps between updates... Wait, I didn't sign up for tha—

playing, since, 2015, Been playing since 2015, always come back, so much content to last forever.
do, at, time, I love this game SO much but the game is to hard I want you Robtop to just make a mode where it tells you what to do at the time, other than that this game is ultimate
realease, on, android, pls realease 2.2 on android
allowed, for, use, It's good but when I try to download not all songs but some they just say "song is not allowed for use" it's terrible 4 star
hop, onto, game, This game is really fun! Whenever I'm bored, I hop onto the game and play some levels. I love the music, the design, and how other people can make their own game. I give this a 5 star! Very entertaining and never gets boring.
get, past, upside, Last year I went camping and during my trip all I did was play the same level over and over (Jumper) I when I was Younger I could never get past the upside down part after playing it for almost 17 hours straight I finally got it. My childhood self was so proud of me. Thank you for making my childhood a rhythmic one :)

save, for, more, HELP is needed. Why I cannot save my game?! I have been trying to save for more than 30min, still unable to do so! HELP!
wanted, from, shop, I really love this game because it is so fun to play. The only problem about the game is that the trail I wanted from the shop costed 4000 orbs. I got that much orbs but I was getting icons instead of the trail I wanted.
going, through, episode, You'd have to be going through a psychosis episode to not like this game.
put, in, levels, How do you make Your own levels change color? The game's levels change color, but how can you put that feature in your levels? I will make it five stars if you add a tutorial for the level editor.
stuck, on, screen, update your game because im stuck on a black screen that say blah blah blha
love, for, dollars, I love this game worth it for 2 dollars!
have, with, levels, Geometry Dash is an incredibly fun game. The community levels are some of the most fun and cool-looking, though you can still have fun with the default levels. It saddens me that the game hasn't received a single update since 2017. There's an issue where on my new Samsung phone, on a level's first attempt in a session, it will momentarily go at 2x speed which gets annoying. I'd really like to see bugs fixed and new features released.

rely, on, google, Honestly I would rate 5 stars if this problem is solved, so the login method is so not good I accidentally deleted gd and I have an account and I can't save it so even when I installed it it would make no change it cannot save it even when I have a nice phone and 200mbps maybe you could just rely it on google or Facebook so it could be easier, but still I'm so disappointed I tried to email you but you didn't respond, so dont tell me to email you please fix this I know what othersthinkaboutthis
got, on, force, it's good but it's not to good. I hate that I got 18% on hexagon force.

work, on, pixel, does not work on pixel 6 :(
put, to, game, Really fun and u actually have to put time in to the game
started, to, beginning, When i was playing this game.i restarted the phone. And the game started me all over to the beginning. This is why i have 1 star right now. This game needs to be fixed when 2.2 comes.
died, at, %, I died at %75 and now I hate myself
Getting, at, it, Getting good at it
say, except, games, Uhh it's gøød and fun to play I don't know what to say except the games just good
optimized, for, OS, A few years later and this game is still challenging and amazing. It would be great if the developers updated the game and optimized it for the newest OS.
play, in, time, Fun just to play in free time
played, since, 2017, I've played this since 2017 and it's amazing, but I wish moderators would look at non popular creators, I love making levels, but I'm not a famous player, and 2.2! Where are you?

wait, for, 2.2, Great game! I'm amazed in it and I'm very good at the game! Though, one thing that bothers me is s level editor. I dont understand how it works so mind adding a FULL tutorial? Anyways I cant wait for 2.2 for mobile!

apply, to, me, This game never gets old and it's pretty much the only game I play anymore. The only reason I knocked a star was due to the load-save system. There are many reviews with issues but none apply to me as I regularly save, except it will only save current data if I have gained stars. This only happens on mobile and I have lost progress and coins on many levels as a result.
