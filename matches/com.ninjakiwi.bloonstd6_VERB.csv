thrown, in, face, This is amazing and I really appreciate all the details there are no ads so you don't get random apps thrown in your face when you need to focus,overall the game is so so so so amazing we'll done!
recommend, to, anyone, I played the other games they were just fine, but when I bought this game it doesn't even start up. I don't belive it is my phone because it can run other games that need internet even better. Also I don't think it's the internet. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone because it won't even start. I've read the other reviews and they talk about how good the game is. I can't even play this game. This Sucks! Would have given it 0 stars if I could. I want my money back . >:(
played, at, house, I love this game. I played it at a friends house 3 months ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. All of my friends play it, and its one of the best tower defense games I've played. But the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, I have an Acer Chromebook 15, and it won't install on my device. I don't really get it, and I read all of the common problems, but they all seem to be already fixed. Anyone else have this problem?

spent, on, it, this game is worth every penny I spent on it. This game has the best graphics in the series, it has game-changing mechanics, and monkeys! This game has and will always be my favorite strategy tower defence game of all time.
play, with, time, Its really fun to play with your free time.
spending, on, bloons, I'm a long time fan of bloons so this review cuts deep especially after spending so many hours and money on bloons 5. This game captures the same charm as BTD5 but feels only skin deep when you compare things like monkey money rate and challenge balances. The earning rate was nerfed into the floor while the spending options increased 2 fold. The challenges have long stopped being fun and have become a souls like grind to find perfection instead of just being fun, different and challenging.

putting, with, bs, Quit hiding my bad review and fix your connection issues. I can easily mark other bad reviews as helpful. I am not putting up with your bs. Do. Your. Job. Period.
playing, on, sisters, I'm playing on my sisters phone and I just think it's a great game overall.
Grinded, for, master, Grinded for Apex Plasma master, but it won't even work. Will rate 5 stars if this is fixed

make, so, paragon, You guys should make it so the ninja paragon since it sucks up shinobi tactics also will allow it to attack xtremely fast so it should throw 40 shurikens the shurikens should also have the master bomber explosion that destroys moabs on hit he should also throw those orbiting blasts around him he should use that as a sticky bomb but he can rapid fire it but he can only do that at paragon degree 20 hopefully you add this to BTD6 ANYWAYS I LOVE YOUR GAME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING NICEFrom MicahFilton

add, into, one, I loved playing the older games on coolmath and me and my brother would play the fifth one in co-op and I'd love if you would add it into this one too. I'd definitely give 5 stars then
return, with, plenty, Amazing game thats easy to return to with plenty of content
use, as, video, I'm a youtuber I think I will use this as a video
played, for, time, Love the game and I have played the series for quite some time. On computer this game runs fine from what ive heard. The game runs perfectly fine other than when you do boss bloons co-op on mobile. Other than that the game is definitely worth the money for the content and is overall really fun.

put, into, game, monke. I've put over 100 hours into this game. Would say best $5 I've spent, but there was a discount, so I got it for $2. Great for hours of fun, and being constantly updated with new content for you to use. Best game on the platform.

done, with, characters, This game so much fun to play and the control -s are pretty easy and you get rewards every day when you log in and my favorite character is the military towers especially the sniper I'm almost done with all the characters of there levels. I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH. Btw this game cost money but that's ok I don't care If this game cost money Or not 🙃 :).......

play, as, bloons, You should add a game mode were you play as the bloons.
Works, like, charm, Works like a charm. Consider adding a new hero
crashes, to, December, November to December 2021, game crashes when I open trophy store. Brilliant game though would recommend.
playing, for, years, playing for years, any im kinda tired of getting kicked from a game, than rejoining to later be removed you should not have the option to kick it should be a time limit kinda ridiculous. and plus if you join and it says wait till the end of a round you just get stuck on that screen, and have no option but to leave.

play, with, girlfriend, Giving it a 1 star now, can't even play a solid game with my girlfriend, the connection with leaving the game all the time is beyond bad, also nothing is wrong with my internet, so please don't blame it on this. I've literally paid for this game and it doesn't even work properly.

save, with, it, Everything is wonderful but there is one flaw when I uninstaled it did not save my data with it so when I reinstalled it didn't carryover with it it was the same account and everything just didn't carryover.

reach, to, round, One of the best games I've ever played. My only problem is that when you reach to about round 90 in CO-OP the game starts to lag and sometimes it kicks everyone out.
play, for, hours, I can really play this for hours, its very entertaining when you first start and even when you are level 100!
is, with, co, Great game, only issue is that with co-op there is a bug where at high rounds you can get kicked, and you can't join back as it will keep saying waiting for the end of the round over and over.

get, on, round, This game can get hard especially on round 28, 30,63,95,120. Also pls add bloonchipper
play, by, person, I love this game I got it months ago but maybe 2 years ago but I was inspired to wanna play it by another person who plays but I have 3 idea's to update this game. My 1st idea is to add sport monkeys such as Basket Monkey, Soccer monkey, Dodge Monkey, Volley Monkey, wrestle monkey, and football monkey, baseball monkey, Hockey Monkey, and Tennis Monkey. My 2nd idea is to add Holiday monkeys and you know all the holidays. 3rd make a Coach hero with the name Coach Marcus who throws all sport balls.

disable, at, time, Good game but when balloon tower defense 2 comes out it should have a mod toolbox but you have to disable it to get achievements but you can disable it at any time but next round your able to earn achievements
watched, on, it, Amazing game so far! I've watched videos on it of people playing but its not untill ive actually expierienced it myself thatIi realized how great the game actually was. Worth the money spent for sure, if I could give it 6 stars, I would.

play, with, friends, This game is really fun. It's also good to play with friends. Has surprisingly alot of content and is not pay to win. I love clash of clans but it is pay to win where as this game you can grab a computer or phone and you can make it to the leaderbords if your good enough without having to spend more than the initial price.

complaining, about, something, Weird. My review was removed again. Don't play this game. The devs are completely incapable of taking criticism. They're dishonest in their actual ratings if I've been removed three times now. If the game has issues fix it. I mean seriously what kind of snowflakes deletes a review becau it's complaining about something. I havnt played the game since my first review that's been removed and a few of my buddies are too. They say they're gonna let their friends who play this game know too. Fix. It.

have, For, that, Awesome game, but sad that the Bloonchipper was not included. For that I have to take away a star. Edit: Co-op mode has been finicky, so taking away another star. Edit 2: Co-op mode getting slightly better. 4 stars
does, in, way, Was a bit on the fence buying this game as I don't really like tower defense games, but this game does it really well and in a fun way as well. You should definitely give it a try.
missed, from, btd5, Though it can be a little buggy they added everything I missed from btd5.
play, by, yourself, Even know this cost money, trust me it is the best game I have ever played. So many things to do and no ads and u can do co OP or just play by yourself. No ads ever coming and is good for all ages. 5 star for sure.
play, with, friends, This game is very fun and addictive. There's not any ads and you can play this with friends! Come try it out.
played, for, years, played 5 and btd battles for years and these games are still amazing, the game is similar to 5 but i don't mind, would definitely recommend
adding, as, icon, I have had an amazing tike playing this game its a great time passer I only have one suggestion and it isn't from me directly but I have seen an idea on reddit for adding a farmer icon to banana farms as a buff icon so it's easier to know if they are in range or if anything link bannana farmers to the farms so when you buy one and there's a banana farmer on the screen it triggers a range display and every farmers radius is shown as if It were selected. That's all otherwise this game would be 5.

throws, on, 80/80, This game USED to be worth all 5 stars. There are so many glitches and game crashes and you will lose your hard earned monkey bucks when it crashes and throws you out of the game on wave 80/80 with no reward!!! It is INFURIATING how thoroughly impossible and unplayable this game has become!!! I have invested so much time into playing only to have my progress lost to game crashes! HOT GARBAGE.

starts, in, game, Incredibly fun at first, but in end game it starts getting boring and repetitive, although, the boss battles and odysseys fix that
unforgiving, to, phones, Great game head's up, late game tends to be unforgiving to phones on lower end hardware

buy, for, weeks, I had been wanting to buy it for weeks and now that I got it I have no regret
disappears, into, air, It's a great single player game. It can be fun playing co-op but the co-op servers are absolute trash. I have lost count of how many times my best insta monkey disappears into thin air as I place it or how many $1000's have disappeared as well. I've even had monkey money lag out with no reimbursement. It's complete BS

fix, due, amount, Wow this is a fun game. would love if they could fix the multiplayer due to amount of times it disconnected players but other than that it's definitely worth the money!
gets, after, while, Fun but gets boring after a while
waiting, for, round, Really good game big fan of the old games aswell but the multiplayer is just do broken Everytime you play it will say you disconnected and then it says waiting for round to end but Everytime the round is about to end it will freeze and not process that the round ended and you will just be in a loop and have to quit the run.
go, into, sandbox, This game is amazing and there is so many maps to play on and so many monkeys to use. If you feel bored you could go into sandbox made and do anything you want to it is such a fun game and unlimited possiblitys

chill, with, randoms, Love this game, just please fix the co-op servers! They're really bad and annoying when I'm just trying to chill with randoms. I'll give it 5 stars again once you fix the co-op problem.

playing, on, DSi, I'd honestly rather be playing BTD4 on a DSi. The game feels way worse to play now.

kicking, from, game, Wow is multiplayer terrible, from constant disconnections to people kicking you from your own game you hosted via message your coop position has been closed, not my fault your severs or whatever is trash. Funny they have a whole prestige shop for cosmetics to show off online when online is broken.

earn, per, kill, Stressful Game : - Skill tree Type 👍 - Mixing any Skills on Every tower👍 - you control LvL Any towers on Field using coins You earn by killing 👍 - unlocking hero purchase using prize Money you earn👍 - Coins you earn per kill is too Small Too hardcore makes you loose always & Gets stress.. instead of playing happy Imagine getting 1 coins per bloons. & Upgrade worth is thousands. Also the prizes amount you earn is very small Two stars for A stressful game 👎👎 no fun playing anymore 😤❌
takes, to, long, its very good it just is that when you play it takes to long to level up

gets, past, bow, Would give six stars but Quincy said nothing gets past his bow and something did
doing, for, run, The difficulty spike with the Elite Bloonarius/Elite Lych is ridiculous. Strategy is one thing. Having to basically quit out the game, sell your towers/farms, reset those farms and towers up, and doing that for the entire run is stupid. Should be able to just play the damn game without having to cheese it to win.
dropping, in, middle, Paragon idea sky dominator in game cost 1.25 million ability 1 mission x boosts all monkey aces on screen 25% increase attack speed and 5% increase attack damage. It's second ability world domination covers the entire map in walls of fire and dropping an enormous bomb in the middle. It does extra damage to Moab class balloons. Also it's a paragon idea for the monkey Ace and you can pick the look for it I want it half flying fortress half sky shredder kind of like.
had, in, weeks, Love this game. But, there was one problem I've had with in the last 3 weeks I've been playing. I completed a odyessy and I didn't get the rewards. I'm pretty sure the reward is trophies for the trophy shop. I checked before, and I had 5 trophies, and when I went back to the trophy shop I still had 5 trophies.
felt, After, update, Super slow and crashes alot. I cant play the game properly anymore. After the update, I felt like I was getting the 2010 experience. It took less time for my computer to startup then entering into a map. They really deleted my first two ratings.

happens, in, co, I absolutely hate it when we were playing co-op, seems fun and all, that is until you get disconnected. The frustration when you used your powers and insta monkeys but there it goes kicked you out and you watch as the moabs enter your base leaving an insta game over. Note that this only happens in co-op, I sincerely hope this gets fixed

lag, in, coop, The core gameplay is fun but in coop, it would lag so much and would disconnect the other player. Please fix your game
deleted, after, update, I love the game but after the update it deleted my progress
transferred, to, phone, I transferred to a phone and lost my account. I was had every Monkey and every upgrade and lost it all
got, on, grandmother, I got this for free on my dad's grandmother birthday it's a miracle
disconnecting, for, reason, The single player campaign it's perfect! With little to no lag except when the bloons or the projectiles are too many for the game to handle. There's so much game mode where you must alternate your defenses 5 star for the single player But.... The multiplayer it's very bad for mobile. It's so laggy, me or my teammate always disconnecting for seemingly no reason. There's also very noticeable amount of delay 2 star for the multiplayer aspect
indulging, in, application, Absolutely splendid. Would highly recommend indulging in this exquisite cellular device application.
thinking, of, buying, If u were thinking of buying I did and it is value buyit!
play, for, hours, Great gam could play for hours
add, to, version, I love your game it's just that you need to add more paragons to mobile version on PC you can have every single one of the military monkeys paragon but you can't on mobile so please fix that then I'll give you five stars I wish I could give you four and a half Stars but I can't so yeah But I love your game 😍♥️♥️♥️💘💘💘💘^_^so can you please reply to me (TT) oh yeah one more thing I literally have so much skins and I literally have a whole Paragon on one of my levels I almost have two of them

playing, with, people, So good game especially easy for exp and sandbox love the game and playing with different people play this game
play, without, adds, Fun game, so nice to just play without adds.
kicks, to, point, I absolutely love this game but the co op has been completely miserable since the last major update it never wants to stay connected and kicks people to the point it won't let you rejoin
ping, for, THAT, 11 out of 10 work. 6 star work. Sooooooooooooo fun. I play it so much cause I love it. My only problem is lag and I am not going to ping you for THAT. Keep it up. I don't think I did good grammar there, but STILL THE BEST GAME EVER MONEY SPENT WELL.
got, into, series, My cousin got me into the Bloons series by showing me BTD battles and I loved it and he had told me to buy this game so we could play co-op. I was hesitant at first but he convinced me the only problem is the co-op is absolute garbage and never works. Other than that the game is amazing 5 stars if they fix co-op
paid, for, money, I played for so long and enjoyed the game but then I paid 1.99 for monkey money and never got it.
loading, into, game, Btd6 is a fun game, but I would start loading into the game and it would crash

runs, of, course, My device sucks, so of course it runs slower, but I still find enjoyment in this. Even though I don't like tower defenses too much.

recommend, as, purchase, I love this series. A bunch of good games. I recommend this as your first purchase on a game on play store. Such a fun game. 10/10
get, past, wave, Was a grand game but now you can't get past the hart wave
addicted, to, it, I like it so much that I am addicted to it
progress, through, game, I love this game it is so fun to unlock things because it gives some fun since you only have one tower but the more you progress through the game you unlock more things.
logging, with, details, I love this game but I lost my 104 level account due to logging in with the same account details as my level 18 account. hope they can fix this
got, on, sale, It is really fun to play, got it on sale and I would not mind paying full price! Only problem is it was really hard playing on Co-op. I went on so many lobby's and I was needing to reconnect and a bunch, It not be Kiwi's fault but it is kinda hard on Co-op, apart from that amazing game! Recommend to get BTD6 BIG TIME!
playing, on, it, Like the game very fun to play would get it if you want it but I will have to say that every time I play co op it decides to always kicks me out and makes me rejoin no matter what I'm playing on it always does this it's kind of annoying I can't play the game when the entire time I gotta rejoin y'all need to fix it bc I wanna play with my friends but I can't for this reason and it kind of sucks and makes it unenjoyable

playing, for, years, This guy name linc says he has been playing bloons TD 6 for 6 years even tho this game is 3 years old but eh the game is the best no bad experiences pretty fun :)
messed, with, co, Good game, though the last update seems to have messed with co-op games and it keeps timing out connections air more than it was previously. If that is fixed will put 5 stars. Have enjoyed bloon games for years now

doing, for, hours, I can't even play the game before i could but since I like the data thing now I can't even open the game it will take hours before I can open the game and I'm not just stand being there or sitting there doing nothing for hours, please fix that and if you fix it then I will give it a five stars
crashes, at, rounds, Impossibile to play coop, it crashes every time at higher rounds.
do, in, this, So much more to do in this than btd5 the monkey s are 3d there are much more monkeys too and there are 3paths now boss battles come up daily about twice as much maps, and beast yet once you get all the upgrades you can merge the monkeys into one.

wasting, on, mode, The game is very fun and I'd give it 5 stars, but there seems to be a server issue where it disconnects you randomly and reconnecting does not always work. One thing I am not fond of is allowing players to close the position of another player. I ended up wasting 600 monkey cash on a boss mode because I briefly disconnected and another player closed my position. Other than that, it has a lot of gameplay value and content.
playing, for, long, I have been playing for so long it is so fun
passing, with, game, I absolutely love the Bloons TD franchise and I enjoy passing the time with this game. I've put plenty of hours into it and tend to have an enjoyable experience. My biggest complaint would be the co-op aspect of it. It seems I'm constantly being kicked and whenever I rejoin it'll just kick me right back out. It has cost me a few Impoppable challenges due to me being unable to support my teammates. I just hope the online will get worked on soon because the game is great otherwise.

CANT, WITH, BROTHERS, HATE IT I CANT PLAY WITH MY BROTHERS IT SUCKS
progresses, with, level, Overall really good game with heaps of great features. Super satisfying to play, the game progresses well with yoyr skill level, there are a lot of features where you need to look past the surface to find.

get, around, boredom, I'm an old btd 5 player, this is my experience. I bought this beautiful game pretty late. Around a year ago, I first played it and instantly loved it as soon as I started. I still find ways to get around boredom with it. Love it so much 11/10

played, on, playstore, This is one of the best tower defense games i have ever played on the playstore, there's many different characters, heroes, and there's even special bosses like the lych or bloonarius! I also love how you gotta get xp to unlock different upgrades for different characters. One problem tho, is probably giving Etienne bit of a buff, and maybe making the lasers that the alien skin of etn shoots count as lasers, so it would pop leads, but not able to pop purple bloons. Keep this game in mind!

want, during, gameplay, Can there be a menu that confirms I want the upgrade from the upgrade windows during gameplay or in between round, so I don't have to go all the way to the upgrade menu, confirm it, then go back to said monkey and buy said upgrade

recommend, to, anyone, This game is the best in the series and highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tower defense games.
pop, in, it, Fun and exciting you can pop balloons in it.
rejoin, in, menu, Everything is great But the one thing that needs to be fixed it when the game disconnects to co-op and it doesn't work to rejoin in main menu.
running, on, fios, FIX YOUR SERVERS! I am running on fios. It's not my net, it's not my phone.
tacks, to, long, The multiplayer tacks to long
play, with, friends, It's a great game to play with some friends. Wish they would be more generous
CONNECTED, TO, INTERNET, This game is great, BUT I ALWAYS KEEP LOSING CONNECTION TO THE MULTI PLAYER GAMES, WHEN I LITERALLY AM CONNECTED TO HE INTERNET, FIX THIS RIGHT NOW!!!
fussty, in, gam, This games ausum it has pat fussty best in gam
kept, from, TD5, I like the new animations and new upgrades alot, and they kept the old maps from TD5, nice..

playing, for, years, Ive been playing Bloons for over 6 years and I'd like to talk about 6 for a second. It's a solid game. It's got to s of towers and upgrades and tons of maps and packs a lot of content. But the over all game can't compare to the charm and fun of Bloonstd5. Over all though great game and you should get it if your thinking about it.

looking, for, challenge, Excellent game, undisputably the top tower defence on the market for beginners or people looking for a serious challenge.
evolved, as, years, I feel like the Bloons TD games have evolved as the years went on and I love all the games this ones great the all the new stuff makes it so fun. It's a surprise around every corner
deal, with, ads, Excellent tower defense game. Happy to pay the $5 and not have to deal with ads. They do a good job of gradually giving you access to new towers so you can learn how to use them. Plenty of long term game play with all the upgrades.
owned, from, day, Great. Ive owned this game from day one and havent regreated buying it.
put, down, 😂, Love the game way better than just being able to put 4 towers down 😂😂😂😂

bogged, with, past, Been so bogged down with the past to play and ALL THE ADS. there are very few of any ads here and while there is still an aspect of post for more features it seems more fair. Other games you can easily spend over 100 dollars and your STILL scrambling to get anywhere. This game is great!
asking, for, rating, Keeps asking for rating, no dismiss forever option.
seen, in, while, Good mobile game haven't seen those in a while
wanted, for, year, It is a cool tower defense game and I have wanted this game for A year so I just got it in the start it's a little grinding but it's fun

sign, for, features, Love this game definitely even if you have to pay to download one of their best works yet continue to make more and what's best you don't have to pay to win you can just sign in for free and unlock cook new features and I especially lie he sandboxode
say, of, you, Uh no need to say of you have played it easy 10000000/5
spent, on, game, Best money I've spent on a mobile game ever before and with all of the new content NK has been adding, it's be alot more enjoyable with much more to do! I had Bloons TD 6 rated lower because the game was getting stale with the slow updates but NK has improved the game greatly since then.🤟🏼 The multiplayer still needs some work however. It's tough trying to play with friends having connection issues being relatively common. It would make the game that much better then it already is if fixed.

TRYING, TO, ACCOUNT, My third time deleting and trying to install the game I spent 30 MINUTES TRYING TOOG IN TO MY FREAKING ACCOUNT and I can't even do that the game just restarted all my data at this point bc at first When I wanted to play the game it went dark immediately so I deleted it and forgot about the game entirely come back and all the sudden I can't even log in. Wow I love this game.

admired, with, IAPs, Up until now I've loved BTD6. I had admired their integrity with IAPs and customer satisfaction. I believed everything available in game was obtainable by playing, especially since the game cost money to play to begin with. Unfortunately I've found a game changing $20 IAP that cannot be obtained without payment that DOUBLES cash earned in game. Also, CO-OP is unplayable and after contacting support I was asked numerous questions for days just to be told they're already aware and looking into it

try, for, yourself, Very enjoyable game I highly recommend you try it for yourself
paid, for, ads, My first tower defense game. Fun characters and intuitive design. Worth what I paid for no ads.
know, about, game, Dude, idk why this game is 4.99 (5.00) but this game is so good!!! I mean iv'e played BTD5, so this game has to be harder. This game is just on the ball tho!!! Iv'e watched a few videos about it, so I kinda know about the game. This gets a 5 star rating!!!!!!!!!! Perfect ninja kewey!!! Keep it up!
refreshing, in, world, Very fun game and no ads. The lack of ads is refreshing in a world full of ads. The game itself is fun and developers update with new content frequently.

went, to, shop, This game is so much fun that I couldn't withstand the other ones also the graphics were good I still don't understand how the monkeys had no other skin size do normal one unless you went to the skin shop I mean the trophy shop
install, for, mobile, It is a great game and able to spend many hours playing it but after you unlock everything there isn't a lot to do. And the worst part is that it's basically impossible to install good mods for mobile
broing, at, times, The games gameplay gets a little bit broing at times but it is packed with lots of content!

have, from, which, In my opinion this is the best tower defense game lots of nice quality of life features and lots maps to choose from which you also have the ability to choose your own mutators and create fun challenges for other players and there are so many towers with there own branching path upgrades where you have to pick which one you think is the best.
get, in, day, I love this game and there is no way you can get bored on it in a day
crashing, on, Android, Constantly crashing on Android. Solid outside of that
disconnected, from, games, Continously disconnected from multi-player coop games. Also game runs slow when getting to round 100 and above. Will 5 star if fixed
play, with, friends, This game is fun and fun to play with with friends
play, with, friends, I really love this game because there is a lot to do and you can play with friends or just by yourself...one disclaimer tho about the co-op. EVERY TIME I USE POWERS IT WALWAYS LAGS OUT AND THEN ALL MY MONEY GOSE TO COMPLETE STRANGERS. If you fix this one thing I might come back to this and make it a 5 star. Fix the bug 😭

owned, since, week, I have owned this game since (the week of) it's release.
played, in, life, Best strategy game I have ever played in my life. Only problem is the co-op game mode. Often lags out and glitches and the server is super slow, resulting in high packet loss so my friends and I were even able to get a Tier 5 which we did not have by spam clicking

help, with, lag, I love this game BUT BTD6 Really needs some options to help with the lag. Devs need to update this game and add 'remove effects' and 'lower quality' so that the FPS is normal when playing a boss game!! Otherwise would be 5*
pay, for, times, This is an amazing game and I would pay for this 10 times to play it for an hour. Very addictive, pretty much the only game I play these days.

makes, for, it, I like this game although bloonchipper is missing it makes up for it by the new towers which are very good in their own unique way. The only thing that could make me happier is if bloonchipper was put in.
entertained, during, classtime, Ye ye keeps me entertained during classtime🤣 I truly do enjoy it
go, with, one, Good old classic tower defense, can't go wrong with this one
buy, for, gamers, Good game for ppl who like stresskillers,yes at times its frustrating,but its worth it,a must buy for all the casual gamers out there too.
get, through, all, Very great time killer get through all of my period without geting bored
play, with, friend, Every game I play I with my friend we either always have to reconnect every round or rejoin the game after round 50... I don't understand what the problem is but it's frustrating. A really good game but this is killing me. Please fix this or help me fix it

DEFEATED, in, co, I DEFEATED THE B.A.D TODAY (in co-op cuz I just give people money like it's nobody's business so I made some bananananana farms and did my thing) I LOVED DOING IT

crashing, at, levels, Fantastic experience so far, i have heard issues of crashing at higher levels, i have yet to incounter it, though.
Loved, since, Defense, Loved this game since Ballon Tower Defense 1. It is still one of my most favorite ways to pass the time.

rid, of, chipper, A very good game but I'm sad they got rid of the blood chipper

pop, on, gunner, How can lazers and majic not pop lead bloons??? They are immune to it but u end up getting fireball, wall of fire, Then dragons breath. Pls make it so magic monkeys(not fire stage) can pop lead and the lazer(not first lazer upgrade) on the darling gunner can pop it! 1 star :( okay well I like it now but pls reply :(
begged, for, it, I absolutely love this game. I begged for it for Christmas as soon as it came out. The only reason I'm taking a star away is that I believe if the player can choose the ability that goes off on a specific monkey/hero that would make the game as a whole, 5 stars.

get, to, rounds, ninja kiwi this is a great game except for one thing when you get to higher rounds so there is more projectiles so it is more laggy so in the next update please add remove projectiles so it isn't laggy anymore for mobile players
do, at, stage, Bruh I played 6 hours of bloonarius cause it's slow asf, I leave to do something at the fifth elite stage and it crashes and my save is lost. Bruh
tried, on, data, Co op doesn't work. Got very good internet 500 mps good router, tried on data too. Me and my friends all playing on latest phones, can not play co op with friends that bought the game just to play with me. Seems like multiplayer is only meant for pc players so if you and your friends want to play together on your phones do not get it, it doesn't work.

play, during, time, This game is so fun to play during free time I'd recommend buying this game
play, with, friends, This is definitely worth $4.99/$5.00 and I love this game so much. It is one of my favorite games. It's an amazing game to play with your friends. THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!
resides, in, co, This game is really fun but requires a bit of patience. The wait is worth it though. But the problem resides in co-op, for example, i get quit out almost all the co-op games i play. If this issue hets fixed i would be very happy and satisfied
