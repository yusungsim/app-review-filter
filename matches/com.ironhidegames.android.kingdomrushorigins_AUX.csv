'm, fan, huge, I, Ah, I really wanted to like this game, but... it just wasn't my taste :/ I loved the original Kingdom Rush, so I'm pretty sad that this one didn't live up to my expectations. For some reason, the colours seem too garish, the stage layouts often look cluttered & confusing, and I'm not a huge fan of the towers in this version. But the dealbreaker for me has to be the amount of spiders 😭 The original had spiders too, but as an arachnophobe, the Mactans level was a nightmare. Couldn't finish it 😭
is, game, hard, This, KR series aren't fun at all. It's all about founding the right tower setup. You can't max upgrade your towers, just one or two in the last few waves. It's like they give us a machine gun with just 5 bullets. This is not a hard game, if you want to beat it just search for the right setup for each round. You won't have the ability to play with strategies, you will have to find THE ONE strategy and that's it.
are, mechanics, simular, they, Very good, I always played the other versions of this game and they are all simular mechanics, but once you finish the story you would want a new game which is this. new story, same mechanics, and new champions/character design
is, reason, only, that, Honestly I have loved playing kingdom rush. I just feel disappointed that at the extra levels they are too hard because I have only one hero so I can't keep up with the influx of enemies, my hero Mr A is tired from running to and frow! Anyways thank you for such a quality game, that is the only reason I rate it 4 stars.
is, rush, wierdest, This, This is the wierdest kingdom rush, mages that fires 2 per shot, a MAGE that fires very fast but excells at single target dps, artillery that can stack 3 shots like the archmage and summons units, bladesingers that both excells at dealing damage and tanking despite its looks. Forest keepers which is only 2 units but is actually a support tower. Despite all of it its still high quality, i REALLY wonder where are the others in origins like blackburn, nivus, and the rest of the heroes in the series?
's, game, good, It, It's a very good game, but I put 4 stars because if you're a noob on the game, there's not any way to get better, so u get stuck in a level and u can't continue
's, game, excellent, It, It's one of the best games that exist in the PlayStore. I started out by playing Kingdom Rush, the free version. And I realized that the whole saga is worth buying. Also my congratulations for the developers, the game has very cute and cool graphics. It's an excellent game!
's, style, unique, It, One of the best tower defense games out there! It's unique style, awesome upgrades, and original maps and enemies make it hard to compete with. By far one of my favorites.
's, wonder, real, It, It's a real wonder to play, so much strategy and fun.

is, game, best, This, This is the best game ever......and the characters are awesome along with the sound effects.....best game ever
is, con, big, this, Best game of the series imo. Pros: -Way more free heroes than in original game, -Graphics are definitely improved compared to other Kingdom rushes, -Very unique enemies, -Some actual story, -Great map events. Cons: -Isn't free (and this is a big con since it is a mobile game) -Doesn't take too long to finish a game. Even though there are challenges they're basically the same level with harder difficulty. Overall I'd rate this game 8/10

is, installment, great, this, Love the kingdom rush series, this is another great installment!
is, game, thought, It, It is a great thought out tower defense game. I like the animations and simple to learn and play.
's, game, amazing, It, It's Kingdom Rush. It's an amazing Tower Defense game. It's a mobile game that is actually great as an actual game, not just great for a mobile game.

is, game, excellent, This, This is an excellent tower defense game. No ads, no pay to win, no annoying popups. Extremely cheap, definitely worth the money. Else you can just play thenoriginal which is free, without ads. You can easily sink 10+ hours enjoying. It doesn't really feel worth revisiting levels with highest difficulty. Maybe that can be improved in future games. Solid 9/10.
are, games, only, These, Even better than kingdom rush These are the only two games you need on your phone
is, game, favorite, This, This is my 2nd favorite Kindom Rush game from Iron hide. Really fun to play like every other kindom rush game. They should have added more game themes like snow or something. You can look at the the enimes from a book in the game and look what they can do and how much heath they have which is unique. And you can spend your stars to get upgrades for your guys.
is, Rush, first, This, This is the first Kingdom Rush I played that I actually stopped playing and deleted it. Who thought it was a good idea to have levels change up the path halfway through? Or allow people to go other routes of nowhere? I get you're trying to make it different but for me personally this makes the gameplay infuriating and not fun. I worked for 12 level and now everyone can pretty much bypass the defenses? How is that fun???

is, one, worse, this, I love this series, but this is the worse one.
is, defense, best, This, This is the best Tower 🗼 defense
's, balance, right, It, I never really got into the tower defense genre, but this completely changed my mind. It's very engaging, well thought out, just the right balance of challenge and reward. You really get the sense that your strategy worked when everything goes smooth. The heroes are also nice to upgrade and to play around with different styles of combat. The levels are a sight to behold and enemy types keep on changing appearances which keeps everything fresh.
is, time, fun, it, This game is so amazing, it's really easy(almost as easy as vengeance) but it is still a fun time.
is, formula, perfect, it, Kingdom Rush has so many ripoffs with nearly identical gameplay because it is THE perfect formula for a tower defence game. In Origins, the new Heroes abilities are nice and otherwise it's a simple but of course highly enjoyable remix of their formula.
be, challenge, good, it, Another top notch TD game from Ironhide. The story is a neat prequel, the free heroes are pretty good, and it can be a good challenge. It is well balanced... unless you pay for Phoenix. This flaming bird of death is truly an AoE damage legend that can incinerate damn near anything. I enjoyed it, and consider it well worth the $3.
'm, supporter, avid, I, Devs deserve a rate after starting my 3rd playthrough! I'm an avid supporter of the Kingdom Rush franchise. <3
's, game, good, It, It's good game like the others
was, game, free, it, started playing the first of this series when it was a free game in flash.....and that's back when i was 8.... now I'm 19 and can't stop ever since I've found this gem
'm, 😔, sad, i, But i'm sad 😔 because I finished all 3 parts it i'm still hoping for a part 4 😀. If you dont have this game you must have to get it its the best game ever!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
is, compliment, huge, which, So far it feels much like there original, which is a huge compliment.
's, version, newer, It, It's a newer version of previous KR games, and I like the new towers powers. My only complaint remains the same: there's no fast forward button. On levels I cannot beat toward the end, 13/15, for example, I don't need to sit through the first 12 rounds. Please add this feature. It gets boring quickly when I have to sit through the same level forever just to try to beat the last two rounds.
is, game, second, This, This is my second favorite game of the series but it has to most well balanced game
is, game, favorite, This, This is my second favorite game of the series but it has to most well balanced game
be, game, honest, this, Pretty much SCAM of a game. Early levels are balanced ok even for harder difficulties but you REALLY feel the push to make you buy real money upgrades. Since it's P2P I was hoping this will be honest game. Nothing but trying to get the most money out of people. Sad
is, game, easiest, it, This is a fit for children but it is the easiest game among the series.
is, game, fun, It, I have a long lasting loyalty to the Kingdom rush series this is in my opinion the easiest of the bunch (although I have not played vengeance). It is a fun game.
is, game, cute, It, It is absolutely a cute tower defense game! Love it, and since the moment I installed it, I haven't put my phone down a minute!
's, difficulty, artificial, it, It's okay. I just cannot get over the mechanic of enemies creating new paths leading basically to the end, or the enemies who phase around the paths and wind up near the end. It feels cheap. Oh, you didn't fortify the very end of the path? Well here comes 50 enemies who just phased around all of your defenses. Usually just ends in a restart and then prepping for it next time, but the point is it's artificial difficulty and I dislike it.
'm, fan, huge, I, The FUNNEST Kingdom Rush Game. I'm a huge fan of the series and this one is by far the funnest to me. Great heroes, great spells, I beat this one way quicker than the others. Start with the first one or Frontiers I would recommend. But once you get some games under your belt you'll love this one too.
is, game, good, This, This is a very good game and I played all off the Kingdom Rush game's
is, change, nice, it, I haven't played the game much, but it is a nice change from the original KR games.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game, but the fact that it resets your progress on a stage if you have to tab away to answer a call or text, etc is really frustrating...
is, TD, good, this, Played a few rounds so far and overall smooth and fluid game play. Enjoying it while I wait or even lounging at home, this is a good TD to enjoy
is, idea, same, this, Super fun! You ever play that balloon game on your iPod? Yeah, this is pretty much the same idea just a whole lot more enjoyable.

's, game, favorite, it, So far, it's my least favorite KR game. Too much that needs your attention on the map. Still, a KR game is better than most.
's, game, nice, it, Alhamdulillaah, it's a nice premium game. I like it.

is, game, classic, This, This is yet another classic TD game. I'm not wild about micro-transactions, so I'm glad that Play Pass includes all of the Kingdom Rush series. Since this isn't their first game, a lot little improvements make for extra fun, but without sacrificing much of the winning concepts in the earlier games.

's, speed, slow, It, It's only one speed, slow.
is, choice, top, this, Another great game from Ironhide. If you like tower defense this is a top notch choice. If you've never played tower defense, start with this or another game from the publisher. Engaging game play, great aesthetic, poppin music. Not a deep story, but enough to bring some context and flavour. Never *need* to make any additional purchases beyond initial game to play through, but the option to expand choices is there for those who want some extra content. Lots of fun to be had here.

's, take, great, It, So far, I have really enjoyed the game. It's a great mythical take on old fashioned TD.

's, game, great, It, It's a great game, but I find the fact that they have a purchase price as well as in game purchases that can influence the pace of gameplay.. Greedy. To say the least.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game with different ways to play to make it challenging. However after only a few weeks I reached the end. Why are there not more levels? I see multiple other games to buy.

was, fan, hardcore, I, Been playing Kingdom Rush since the first instalment I bumped into on Kongregate. Then it was on Android. Needless to say, I was a hardcore fan since day one and I am NOT exactly a lover of tower defense type of games. So yeah, it's that good. Props to the developers!
