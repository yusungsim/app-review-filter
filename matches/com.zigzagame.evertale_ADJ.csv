advertisement, False, False advertisement, the gameplay doesn't match with the ad. I played evertale months ago, the game tricked you with the rpg-like gameplay on the first chapter but then chapter 2 comes and it's just a regular stage selecting gacha game. You can catch monsters but the strongest monsters are incredibly underpowered comparing to the microtransaction monsters. The only progression you could make after finishing the tutorial part of this game is via gacha units/items from microtransaction.

purchase, initial, pretty fun. not to hard of a grind so far. not complicated to play either. a lot of people are saying it's pay to win, but I haven't spent more then the initial purchase.
resources, full, Why i cant download the full resources needed to play the whole game offline

rates, bad, Extremely bad rates. Don't bother whaling here tbh. I've actually gotten more off banner characters than the rate up characters. The ads were right! it is a horror game......at least the gacha portion is.
game, awesome, awesome game feel like playing on a console a little confusing with the monsters and characters but hey what game isnt

char, impossible, Im very like this game, because the story mode and a garbage of feature and event story... But, everything will will be unfair after you keep your soulstone for an almost impossible SSR char and unfair rank that make u feel backward. Because the SSRs r 1:200 to get, unfair raid mode, and the game dev dont response your opinion to make this game more better. Because they r just focus updating in char & event updates, not doing problem fix updates. Thats make this game sucks and cant played by F2P

Report all of their ads as inappropriate because of their false advertising and also horrifying imagery depicting decapitation and extremely violent themes, all of which isn't in the game btw.

time, long, pretty fun but earning gems for summons takes a very long time, and when you do summon you get a weapon instead of a character
evolving, good, This game went from good evolving to 18+ evolving. It is a challenge to beat and is enjoyable till you have to summon for monsters. The newer characters/monsters are very NSFW. I wish there was an option to turn off the NSFW content because every single character has turned into a NSFW contest. Also the rates on this game are very bad compared to similar games.

game, complete, It's a gacha game. I spent money to buy this game that I thought was a complete game. If you use fee to pay mechanics at least be free. Super generic. Dropped it fast
game, enjoyful, I really wanted to like this game, but the graphics in combat are so bad. The story it's a bit boring. It's just not an enjoyful game
monsters, own, I don't know dick about this game, but an ad I just saw from them has stolen monsters from a game called Neo Monsters that came out years ago. Not cool. Use your own monsters in your ads.
game, favourite, It is my favourite game ever I like it...
perfection, pure, pure and utter perfection and it's free to play if you get the game on discount plus no annoying adds. But it can be a big pay to win so that is a downside.

advertisement, false, This add is a false advertisement. I bought this game & it's NOTHING like is advertised. Fun game indeed. But an extremely heavy at 2 win game & is nothing like the pokemon style games like it shows in all the commercials
jokes, relatable, It would be cool to see some jokes in the game. I dont like it to be serious at all times because its stressing the heck out of readers. If I was the writer I would add some relatable jokes and sarcasms. Sure wholesome chit chat moments and motivate each other to get their spirit up would put a smile, but having no humor is like not having to put *a cherry on top of beatiful layered cakes you know? I guess it wouldnt be convinient to add them now, future games I guess would be ideal.

cents, previous, While being able to download this app for free ( instead of the previous 99 cents) I was able to play and found myself slightly entertained, however the constant ads I see for this game presenting itself as an 8 Bit Horror Creepypasta version of Pokemon is textbook False Advertising. If the developers had any confidence in their game, they would drop the act and show REAL in-game footage. The game itself is just fine. But the advertising around it is a sham. 1 star.

game, rich, A story rich and compelling game, yet one feature made me uninstall. Like most apps, there is a free alternative to purchasing items via daily unlocks of crystals. Except after eventually saving up enough of them to use them, it mentions you can only use them if you acquired that same currency from a real money source. Same currency in game, but you have to actually buy it in real life to use it.

game, unique, Don't bother with this game. Been playing for awhile now, it starts good but it seems like the devs stopped caring, features that made the beginning of the game unique have been stripped away and by 2.0 Evertale is just another standard gacha RPG among thousands. The current ads are strange and misleading, new character designs have ridiculous amounts of fan service even by gacha game standards, best to just avoid this sinking ship of a game altogether.

rate, low, Been playing this game since it was released, and I must say that you have a really low summoning rate for SSR characters. Another thing is you focus too much on lewd characters that you forget to improve or make new male or monster SSR characters.

feature, simple, Even simple feature as alliance chat (1 day to implement it) has many bugs. E.g. it's not possible to get daily SS if there are too many messages, you can't scroll them and press the button. Time to uninstall this nonsence.

story, good, This game has a good beginning story but after that the online story is work just to get through. You are charged mana to get through each stage of the online story. The obtaining of characters through a gacha system is annoying at best and frustrating. Beware that you will have to drop money to get the event characters. You will be left with nothing to do after you have done you daily tasks. I encourage the developers of this game to try to find a way to keep my interest for longer than 20mins.

You will be left with nothing to do after you have done you daily tasks. I encourage the developers of this game to try to find a way to keep my interest for longer than 20mins.

type, heavy, The game is fun and combat system is easy to learn. The story gets harder further up which requires having a heavy hitting type SSR characters, unfortunately the gacha system is terrible since both characters and weapons are in the same pool so when pulling 10x draw the guaranteed SSR will likely be a weapon since the SSR weapons have a higher drop rate than SSR characters. In my opinion weapons should be in a separate banner from characters.

game, enjoyable, Is a very enjoyable game. Ive been looking for a game like this. Loads of characters, not to hard to control. But as the others have said, is a kind of pay to win. Ive been in a level where there is no possible way to win no matter how many times I level up, and change stragedys. Only way is to pay. Overall is a very good game; enjoyable with mutiple things like storylines, etc. üëå‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (PS this game is not horror AT All)

health, full, This game is not good the boss was one shot it was my collector's tongue Max level I hit him and it does 1 damage and he heals all the way to full health
devs, original, Terrible. I'm pretty sure the original devs sold off the game, it just gets worse and worse, and they like to remove mechanics making them paid only.
game, other, I'm having trouble upgrading my characters in game every time I do it says there's a connection problem until that's fixed I'm not going to play the game other than that it's fun
designs, older, This game is absolutely amazing! Everything is so detailed and It was only a dollar which is a shock! Alright so I came back to this game after awhile and I'm a little more disappointed than happy. The older character designs were so much better and way less 'sexy' which I actually prefer more as it isn't as fan serviced. Also everything takes forver to load and play it's just not worth the time in the long run. This game was amazing before but now it's sadly not worth it.

characters, good, Got baited by the ads but I started to play and I have stayed for and have lots of good characters wish the leveling system for characters was better tho.
content, enough, Not enough content after story mode. Play story and uninstall.
mode, whole, It's impossible to get a SSR finished the whole story mode and still none.
game, fun, The rolls aren't bad it's a fun game
freebies, more, more freebies for 5star üôÇ
gacha, generic, Don't let the ads fool you, there are no horror elements to the story. It's just another generic gacha with a boring anime storyline.

time, many, I have to change my opinion cause the gacha rate to have a SSR character i spend 3~5d to have a 10x summon but it only drop SR weapon and SSR weapon sometime SR character I have to much SSR and SR weapon 60+ SR weapon and 20+ SSR weapon i spend many time to summon 10x but now i only have 5 SSR character :( Dam wut a hard drop rate=/

game, good, It's a good game but why does it keep syncing üò≠ It didn't bother me at first as it was quick and not often. But now I'm unable to even get to my game for some reason. Still a good game though. Have it on my tablet üëå

game, fun, very fun game so far
day, good, I like the game I suppose I think it's good everything is good now that I think about i suppose well it might not be everything but it's it is good. You should probably download it I suppose have a good day I suppose
game, Good, Good game
game, great, great game 5 stars for me
amounts, numerous, I enjoy the Pokemon like aspect and the numerous amounts of characters. It's even challenging to a degree which I like. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because character movement isnt exactly easy.

ways, more, needs more ways to level up characters
story, initial, so after a bit of time I had to change my review, The gatcha rates for characters are abysmal out of 30+ 10x pulls I have only managed to get one character out of them all not to mention getting the materials to level up said character is so mind numbingly slow you can only promote the character from raid materials which only happens twice a day the games grind is insanely slow after you get through the initial story and the mana system sucks
fun, pretty, This game starts off pretty fun as an idle gacha game with lots of battles in story mode, but after your done with story mode, there really isnt much to do except for limited quest events which last 2 weeks. Gacha rates are terrible - 500 for pity and you may end up burning your wallet just for a certain character. Upgrading characters is even worse, with the increasing "potions" required locked behind gem payments. Maybe do consider making these "potions" more easily attainable :)

character, good, Don't expect a good character without paying for it... the rng is bs... story is lame... game play is meh. Don't install.
banner, same, The summoning system in this game is subpar with the fact that event weapons and characters are in the same banner with SSR Weapon being 4% and SSR Character being 1%. Spent 17k soulstones and only got the character at my last 10x while I probably got more than 8 SSR weapons.

story, Bearable, Borderline p r o n game.Bearable story, kinky outfits, horrendous gacha rate.Worse still they removed the pvp and replaced it with an auto battalion mode, terrible decision as that was the game's only saving grace.Definitely P2W,farming resources takes too much time.Past SSRs are severely weak compared to present ones.The devs most likely wont rebalance them.In short,don's waste your time here like me,spend it elsewhere wisely.If you don't have a reason to stay away,hey,at least do it for me!Thx

games, best, One of the best games I have ever played. The story is amazing. Characters are all really cool. The combat system is so amazing and you can tell they thought it through very hard. The only thing I can say I don't like about this game is the amount of story they have isn't unlimited so if u play it for like a year you eventually run out of story. However good news they are constantly making more story. But yeah great game u should definitely download.

players, free, Game is good, but it is very hard for free players to get gems for summons. Probably the least generous game for new players that I have seen, and when you do save enough gems for a few pulls you will not get an SR or SSR character you will only get weapons and a bunch of garbage characters. Units and weapons should not be in the same summon period. 10 of the x10 banner summons and not a single sr or ssr character, weapons only. Save your money....

updates, few, I liked the game back then but after few updates it just got glitchy and crashes that's why I'm giving it a one star
character, decent, Decent so far. UPDATE 11/17/21: Had to delete. I've spent money in this game but cannot pull a decent character. All I get is normal weapons. Cannot waste anymore time or money for basically nothing. Held on for as long as I could.

stories, perfect, Game is perfect awsome stories but the game sometimes impossible to win and it get a bit boring the more you play .

events, many, As a player of the 1.0 version of the game, I'm greatly disappointed of the many good events no longer appearing in the game. The pity is ridiculous, and the purchasing price for the premium currency is awful. This is basically the Dark Souls version of gacha games. Either be super lucky or super rich. The grinding is now VERY tormenting, and not so rewarding, especially as if the game is always hinting for you to pay to win. There is better gacha than this scum of a game.

gacha, better, As a player of the 1.0 version of the game, I'm greatly disappointed of the many good events no longer appearing in the game. The pity is ridiculous, and the purchasing price for the premium currency is awful. This is basically the Dark Souls version of gacha games. Either be super lucky or super rich. The grinding is now VERY tormenting, and not so rewarding, especially as if the game is always hinting for you to pay to win. There is better gacha than this scum of a game.

problem, big, The story is good, rates are not that bad as everyone says but the mana consumption is a big problem, powering up characters are hard and a pvp content like real time arena would be good

crystal, paid, Edit back, the gacha rate seem retarded, so hard to get 1, when u need like 5 pf them to full awaken. Im only have one ssr that because of paid crystal. To collect crystal for player is hard if dont pay. Game is nice but unless u have unlimited money then u can enjoy. The differences between sr and ssr is like earth and sky. Game already long enough but greedy. U guys can play but be prepared for worse memories. I put 2 star because of stories. And much worse the is vip system. Well goodluck..

stories, little, It's ok. The story is too boring for me, but I enjoyed the Snow White sub story, and I think those little stories are probably the best they got, but it's still nothing amazing. Gameplay is neat. Very simple and quick RPG, but lots of different things to make team building neat and possibly interesting. I hate Gachas the mix weapon with heroes, and I absolutely hate the rates in this game. Finally, a lot of the female designs and art get way too lewd for me. I think some surpass Azur Lane.

gacha, low, It's pay to win and it's falsely advertised. You will find no horror in this game. You'd have to be insanely lucky with this game's low gacha rates to get anything good, and max it out.

banner, limited, rate up sucks not even guarantee ssr char on limited banner
scenes, many, Too much. A lot going on. HEAVY pay to win. Definitely had some fun but finished the og story mode and was sick of the cut scenes even with the fast forward. "Let's take a break here." Lead to many cut scenes of 'sexy' characters. Already deleted and moved on.

story, online, Game itself is really nice, the story is superb. The problem is this game is relly much on SSR character. Meanwhile, this game we're kinda bad for the soulstone grinding. When you get into online story, you have to rally much on character from other people to help you out which making the game kinda not fun. So anyway this game having a NORMAL gacha rate, slow soul stone grinding and really rally on SSR character, well strategy also needed. Other than that like story, music, gameplay is the best

story, Nice, Nice story, Love the characters, but It's hard to get SSR In the gacha, I only have 2. u have 5% chance to get one SSR maybe fix that. Plus If u want to buy something, It's expensive. But It's not hard game to play If u know the strategy üòé

gems, normal, Three stars, why is there paid gems and normal gems? Like this is actually outrageous, every gacha games have only one of them and are not seperated into two, adjust this and I will share it to my friends. And also, you need to draw 1thousand times to get a single ssr item?(except the first guaranteed ssr item). Just how the f?

art, Great, Great art, easy to figure out game mechanics, interesting character, overall not a bad game. The two down sides to this game is: 1. They could have done more with the story. The story give you that old handheld Final Fantasy feel with not much to do or explore. 2. They need to separate the weapon drops from the character drop. Since that is there big draw and push is characters and weapons drops they should separate them so people can pick which they prefer.

game, different, Not the game they advertised. Fun but i paid the money for a different game... Kinda cheap move. And while you can catch a few monsters in the start, you will soon find you wadted your time, as amyou can only catch R monsters or less. Update: And the fun kinda ends with the single playet campaign, unless you are looking for somewhere to sink your cash in. :)

clips, esque, It's been said before, but feel the need to repeat. This game is in no way like their ads or even these preview images. The ads are 8 bit pokemon-esque clips and this game is a 3/4 angle 2d sidescroller with a busy combat UI and no hidden bloody lore to speak of. The game play is okay, so I'm not gonna knock it down to a total one star, but the incredibly misleading ads just really aren't a hit with me so I'm not a fan.

gachas, other, We all know the ads are misleading, so there's that. Also, compared to other gachas, the pull rates are abysmal (gotta do a 10x pull 50 times before you get a guaranteed pity pull? Yeesh). They keep redesigning characters to make them "sexier" (RIP to the original Mysha). The story is fine, it has some nice moments. Alliance war is different & fun. However, the only reason I'm still playing is the great player base. It's fun just to hang and chat after you run out of energy.

ads, misleading, Uses misleading ads on Facebook to sucker you in. This is not a horror/lovecraftian pokemom.
fun, much, So much fun! This is a complex game, but once you get the hang of collecting gems and things with daily logins, you can play most of the fun stuff for free, even pulling worthwhile cards. Highly recommend.

game, Decent, Decent game. Dailies are a bit of a hassle. You can't do them all without reaching a high enough level. You need alot of gems for a chance at characters strong enough to progress in the story. Just looking for a game where you don't need a ton of cash and grind to just chill and play. Tired of seeing sales on every single game where what you get isn't worth the high cost. A little adjustment would go a long way for something this well designed though.

looking, polished, I love the art style and the way the characters are designed. Very polished and good looking. In my opinion the storyline is very good so far. I love all the creatures you can collect, it reminds me of Pok√©mon but more detailed and more fantasy style. Love the game great job developers! <3

game, other, I mean, I guess this game is alright. Lot of characters and such. It's pretty much like any other gacha game you've played, except for the borderline pornographic art for nearly every single female character. It's enough to legitimately make me uncomfortable. It bothered me enough I exclusively use male characters and monsters. So if you're some kind of mouth breathing neck beard type who's really in to anime girls. Like, if you call anime girls "waifu" this is definitely the gacha game for you.

update, new, Game stopped working entirely after "new update" won't update just circles back to app store and playing the game. Hit play tells you to update hit update tells you 2 play. Game has no voice chat has no player trade system and is extremely pay to play. Not that paying helps either as you still get stuck with sr and ssr pie es you can't use or do anything with. Wish I had my money back another game to steal all my cash well giving nothing back

box, white, Never got to play. I was very excited to try this game. Anytime I open it, all I get is a white box with a loading circle. I tried to wait it out, but to no avail. Wish I hadn't wasted that 99 cent on it. Update 11.08.2021: The game was updated shortly after my post and I was able to play. I do like this game, but it's not like pokemon in anyway shape or form; I do not love the false advertising. Also, you really need to regularly pay to compete with the other players on the server.

story, online, I have just completed act 1, and I am enjoying the game very much. But when I played online story, I got disappointed. You are not able to free roam. Btw story is awesome characters are awesome. Can you pls make characters less sexualize? It will be awesome

companion, feline, Turned feline Kud story companion into fox eared human lookin bimbo and personality change. Also retconing her backstory and scrubbing her original form. The character design is passable if it went to a new character, but it race swapped one of the more unique designed story characters, into what looks like a fox eared Rizette, like we don't have enough of her in the game as is. I really wanted more for Mysha, but she got done dirty with this.

time, first, Even though it's hard to get at least a SR char. in a 10x summon, the game itself is very enjoyable. The more you play, the more you get immersed on it. This is the first time that i get so hooked in this type of game, and i'm learning a lot. Thank you. üòäüòä

rates, Bad, Bad rates summoned 100 times only got 1 ssr and it was a weapon chance for ssr is suppoded to be 5% in total and only got 1 ssr out of 100 and it was a weapon saved up star stones for 3 weeks for this im dropping it rng isnt worth it and star stones are soo hard to get

value, separate, I didn't know that paid Soul Stone are not separate value of free Soul Stones when buying by using free Soul Stones. Cuz when I buy using free SS it's just consume my paid SS so my PAID SS is just PLAIN USELESS when I try to not use it when event starts.
gems, paid, game is great so far. I wish the paid gems were a bit cheaper. they're not worth spending money on
game, good, good game and storyline
devs, greedy, Completely pay to win with greedy devs, and horrible RNG the game itself is ok but good luck paying for ssr characters with less than .07% chance if getting the one you want, you'd need to spend thousands to get the 5 character shards to fully awaken a character. I recommend playing the story mode then deleting it cause there's not much eles to do as a f2p player and online story mode is a gimmick you don't see or interact with real players in that mode.

game, good, This is a really good game, good story/content, but i think the characters should wear more clothes, because its kinda weird. Also the gacha is really bad, because its only 1% of ssr's and its really hard to earn soul stones, so please, improve the gacha. And also, i think this game is too greedy, i mean, if you buy something, the price is really high and the things you get arent that good, so we would like to see some improvements. That's all. Thank you for your hard work! :D

game, good, A good game, but I Uninstalled when I realized it was a pay to play game. They give out gems so sparingly that you advance EXTREMELY slowly after a point. If you plan on spending $50-60 in a game, then this is a good game for you. If not, look elsewhere.

game, nice, Overall its a nice game with really really good waifus but the game is extremely P2W. It takes years to upgrade 1 single character, the gacha rates are lower than FGO even. The publisher of this game is driven by greed. The game itself is good but the publisher ruined it entirely. A shame, the game has potential

freedom, more, The game is overall uniquely made, the plot is well thought out and the fact after a fight you don't have to heal really gives you more freedom to explore the game itself.
way, meaningful, The game is nothing like what it used to be, not that it was all that much to begin with. I don't know where all of our money is going, but it clearly isn't being used to better the game in any meaningful way. Also, characters are absolutely meaningless as their designs and backstories can be changed at the drop of a hat.
tools, many, I enjoyed it but it has too many tools to use.
events, free, more free events and diamonds please, i llove the game this cause you go through the story.
plot, generic, Did you like Gameb*y Pokem*ns & Fin*l F*ntasy 3/6? Do you wanna see a lot of generic white T&A anime stills? With an equally generic plot? Do you wanna grind with cool monsters and random NPCs? I'm critical of games I enjoy, and I'm gonna play a lot of this while avoiding "microtransactions".

story, first, After you beat the first story mode the game becomes Mana dependent for most things. Also, you can dump 400$ in the game and never get the final awaken piece for a champion. Get rid of mana requirements and I'll put it 5* the final awaken is annoying but it's not game breaking like the mana system.

sr, worst, You guys have the worst sr and ssr character rate drop. The chances of getting a sr and a ssr weapon is much higher than a character drop. Only characters I have been getting are just rare characters. I have used the 1k gems summon 3 times and within those 3 times. I have already gotten 3 ssr weapons. I would say 2 more times but those were just the same weapons. So fix your character rate drop when summoning cuz as of rn sr and ssr weapons are already extremely guaranteed.

fantasy, final, I actually really like the game, it has pokemon mechanics when it comes to catching monsters, but I mainly like the final fantasy feel
line, fun, fun game great story line.
gameplay, smooth, smooth and nice gameplay, didn't expect to be hooked by this game ,the script/dialogues are well written imo, it's engaging and not boring ,dull or robotic like most rpg games nowadays.. overall , it's fun , engaging and pretty light, not too fast or too slow paced.. very recommended if you're a fan of old school rpg .. the only downside is summon rate

size, sure, nice but make sure size is less as per phones need
mode, offline, Let me tell you that when you finish the offline mode it became very difficult to clear the zone and the Chances of getting the SSR Character is so low even you have a Thousands souls stone. Not I've been thinking of Deleting this game. This ONE DOESN'T DESERVE A 5 STARS
face, stupid, Goddamn the male mc is not only ugly but also super annoying. His stupid punchable face is everywhere in the main stories, events, even summon banners. He's always ruining perfectly beautiful scenes especially between my waifus by showing up in the middle of conversation. Wish I could delete that beta male from units and always use Rizette as overworld unit. Thank god I've changed my default ingame profile pic because I couldn't stand that ugly bastard's face ugh

game, nice, Very nice quality game it also is very easy to play and understand and it has a tutorial for most everything
lvl, extra, Bruhhh i almost had the reward but yall just added some extra lvl
waste, Biggest, Biggest waste of money. Been playing over a year. Everything is good until you try and actually build your platoons and characters. Drop rates are TERRIBLE, if anything. Rigged. They'll give you some decent drops but then GHOST you. Do not waste your time. Game is a scam.

trick, Clever, Not the game I saw advertised on YouTube. Clever trick there's a page on reddit full of people who were duped as well. Really lame of you guys. Lame. Lame. Laaaaame.

level, higher, is5 ok I'm not too far in but you.can catch monsters in the grass so you can just catch higher level guys
game, paid, A paid game with microtransactions :(
power, limited, Don't like the limited power for your team and items and when I met the elf callen had NO dialog what so ever and was very confusing on what they were talking about
while, little, This game is amazing. I've only been playing it for a little while, but it is perfect for fantesy game lovers like myself. Evertale has an amazing story line with a lot of kick butt characters, wepons, and creatures. Also, It's free! Right now it is compleatly free to play, there are still some in app percheses avalible in game, like buying soul stones and money. I compleatly recomend this game to any fantesy lovers.

world, whole, I love the whole world. The story and the artwork are all really unique. However, I can't play a gacha game that gives you a 1% chance at hitting SSR characters. I won't even spend money because those odds are way too low. They are by far the lowest odds I've ever seen on a gacha game. Mixing in the weapons in the character pool is a unique way of making sure it costs users more money to get any good characters. I'll never understand this strategy.

rates, low, Very low rates for SSR character. Should've given one SSR character instead of SR for new player since SSR really hard to get.

mode, offline, I've just realised that after the offline story mode it gets to the point u need to ptw and also the prices you pay are just immeasurable. For exmple a limited pack goes to over a 100. Still tho the game was quite good

style, like, I played this game long ago, back then this game was really cool, like the combat system, Pokemon-like style, story, characters, etc. Overall is good even with the gacha system is fine. Then now I'm back, and just saw black and discorted theme, I think it's just because their new update for Halloween, but it's not. The bad thing is, this game ads are FAKE. Which is very creepy, and not even advertising this game and they're stole other game footages. Just bring back the old Evertale

game, standard, I had this game like a year ago and sad to see the state it's become. Its your standard monster training game with gacha mechanics because of course. It had potential but then spiraled with it's add campaigns of showing it as a grim dark horror in the vein of yume Nikki or Omori, when the actual game is mostly happy go lucky. I stopped playing due to the size on my last phone but these false ads drove me away from getting it again once I got a new phone. Not worth the time since the devs suck.

investor, heavy, The game is great. Story is good, the collection is great. However after losing my account the support team has let me down. As a once heavy investor I recommend you stay away from this game. I wish their support team cared about us, the players. If this gets them to finalize my request to retrieve my account I will update. Is been 3 weeks and I've gotten one e mail requesting specific information which I acquired and sent only for no further contact.

issue, main, I like the story so far and the gameplay my main issue is the summon rate. I play when I have a chance and I'd like to have a better chance than 1% on getting new characters, doesn't seem very worth playing if I can get a decent chance to summon for the available time I put in. Besides that though I do enjoy the other aspect of this game.

game, dark, Fun game but absolutely nothing like any of the ads for the game so actually uninstalled disappointedly would really like to play the dark game advertised.
act, new, Now that I beat act 10,i think theres no reason to keep playing until new act,story,etc. Stop making lewd characters and focus on the story

game, basic, It's okay for what it is, a basic jrpg summoning game, but it advertised itself as a psychological horror game. Deceptive advertising.

point, certain, The story is very engaging and challenging at a certain point. Though I would like to have other ways to get Limit Break Potion for Characters aside from Raids. And also, the Online Story; it should've been just like the offline one that was just free-moving (?) not click on a spot to proceed...

fountain, lucky, Haters gonna hate. Play it, dont play it, whatever. As for me im hooked. Also if you dont have 30,000 gems collected, your basicly broke. Wait for the lucky fountain.
ads, most, The gameplay, music, and art work for this game are all great. But the gacha element kills it. You can train monsters but they are worthless (most ads for this game aren't anything like the game). I spent 35,000 gems (worth about $675 according to the game) and pulled the banner character once.

thing, little, it's awesome I love every little thing about this game and I am happy it's free because before it was like $1 and 99. but I still love this game
feel, classic, like the classic feel and the storyline
ads, misleading, I bought the game because of the misleading ads. Even if it's a decent game, that's not ok.

fun, much, worth it, so much fun
stones, saving, The devs are just money hungry , if your free 2 play , don't even bother . I just used 3 months of saving soul stones to get a character and didn't even receive it . It doesn't make sense at this point , they're forcing me to give up
game, actual, Scammed me out of my money. The ads do not connect with the actual game.
update, minor, What kinda minor update screws you into your adware wont load application..thanks for nothing...but you wont care..
story, new, The developers haven't put any new story to the game they keep making the same character so many times and they refused to listen to there fan base the pvp from 2019 was fun but the new idle rewards and waking up at 5:45 am and 10:45pm to get ingredients is old no one has time to keep doing this the only thing they put new in game is a new purchase deal they focus on people buying thins from game instead focusing on story

stuff, other, Where to even begin? How about adds. Show your game for what it is, I have to say other than some other upsetting stuff, its actually a pretty good game. Great story and gameplay. Now a warning for everyone this game, while it isn't a complete gacha game it is partly a gacha game. You don't need to make in game purchases but, as you will figure out a little later, purchase are encouraged. Also the difficulty level, some of these bosses are off the walls. Other than that a pretty good game.

gacha, worst, The worst gacha game I ever played. Ultra low rates, hard to get free diamonds for summoning. Definitively, pay to play (you read right, not even pay to win, pay to play!) with freemium model. Almost impossible to get a single SSR character without spending real money. Please, don't waste your time with this game, it's not worthy.

minutes, first, This game is great. I was hooked within the first 20 minutes. I am pretty upset that you can't customize your character, or change the name. It is just a set name and a set character, but all that aside, it's still a great game. The story is great, the characters are great. 10/10 recommend!

game, good, I took advantage of the sale that made this game free to play and originally it cost a dollar but once you start playing it you'll find out for yourself that this is a good game and is more than reasonable for the dollar so if it is still free or for a dollar your still getting this game for a steal if not a great deal

game, actual, Kinda liked the game when i first played. Got a bit farther and didn't really like the lewdness and number of girls in bikinis. Stopped playing after i got to a point where you couldn't really make progress anymore and uninstalled the game. A bit later i start seeing ads for this game that were totally different from the actual game, and now It looks like its just suggestive ads now, and the game costs money now... come on, what the heck?

horror, physiological, Nothing like advertised. Didn't get any elements of physiological horror as seen on their page and ads. There's not much to the monster catching, everything is pre-set, you just follow the process. After the first story, the only way to collect new characters is through the gatcha or limited story events.

pity, gacha, First of all, 500 pulls for gacha pity is too much for the ssr char. The gacha system is similiar to FGO, the difference is the weapon here have more specific condition to make it maxed the potential (which is can be annoying too). The paid soulstone used first is greatly disappointing, the AI system in alliance war and arena is dumb. I hope the dev add manual control in arena and war. Change the soulstone system to free soulstone used first. Overall gameplay is enjoyable. !Change the ad image!

rpg, classic, The game starts off great with a mix of classic rpg and mana bases events. Then it switches to all mana based story line that you quickly learn you cannot progress through without paying to play. You receive diamonds as a reward but they don't work as well as the ones you pay for and the support response is the rates are the same for every one. If you don't want to sink money into a game don't get sucked in by this one.

rpg, weak, I've seen alot of cash grab games from summoner wars to knights chronicles to even playing marvel contest of champs. But you guys seriously take the prize. You make people pay for a weak turn based rpg with horrible story telling. Then in order to get the SSR you want it literally is 500 summons!!! Before you can get. I hope people see my review and pray they review bomb your game to a 1 star.

You make people pay for a weak turn based rpg with horrible story telling. Then in order to get the SSR you want it literally is 500 summons!!! Before you can get. I hope people see my review and pray they review bomb your game to a 1 star.

time, long, I rated the game 1 star because every time i pick up something or kill an enemy when the server saves it it'll take a long time to save even syncing takes extremely long. I plaied the game in 2019 and it still has the same problem i have a stable wifi with 20-50 ms please fix this or i might uninstall again

time, more, I used to rate this game highly but, after putting more time in to it I changed my mind. They do all the manipulative garbage that other games do to get you to spend as much money as possible on this game. Do not waste your time playing this game. It will just make you want things that are nearly impossible to earn in game and make you want to waste your hard earned money on this. Play something else. There are better options than this waste of money.

thing, creepy, The video of a Pokemon creepy pasta type thing in the ads is NOT this game.
ads, Misleading, Misleading ads made me think I was getting an 8bit horror game, but instead i got a pokemon/raid ripoff with anime girls. Not even worth the dollar I paid.
way, good, it's a good way to pass the time in all honesty. simple reminds me of Pok√©mon with a little more mid evil age era.

game, Great, Great game I loved the offline story but the online story could use some work, I wish it was free roam like the offline story and I wish you didn't have to use many other then that I love the game, im thinking about uninstalling it because with put the free roam and Manta usage to continue the story makes it really annoying to play. Still would definitely tell others to play tho.

thing, other, Fun, but slows down after you get to level 70 if you're trying to f2p that is, the story is really good one of the things the game has to offer the other thing I really liked was it wasn't only a auto game and that you could take control and do it you self that's hard to find now, if it wasn't so grindy I would still be play, but a good game in all

cash, little, I did like the game and enough to spend a little cash but then to find I didn't receive the products due to false advertising, I was to contact support and after some emails were exchanged, I was told it's my fault and nothing can be done, good game but avoid spending any cash.

time, real, No actual, real-time pvp. Very low summoning rates, the online campaign costs a lot of stamina per fight, desparately needs quality content and not just new characters. Edit: if you happen to lose the code tied to your account then your account is gone for good if you for whatever reason need to uninstall the game. There is no help from their customer service despite providing everything they asked for. I would give them 0 stars if I could.

game, ok, An ok game but nothing like the adds, would have been fun to have a horror pixel monster catching game but the only thing you get is monster catching in act one. And let's be honest, non of the monster you can catch compair to the scantily clad girls you can get with spending money (or saving every special summon token you get). False advertising is an understatement for this game.

reason, only, First off i give it a 2 because it is not what the adds show, not even a little. Which was the only reason i had bought it. But that being said ive played up to ch5 and while its hard to get decent monsters from just random Unique encounters it is over all a fun game.

trash, weak, This game is straight up garbage! All characters and creatures are way OP when you face them, but if you win, capture, or they join your group, they become weak trash! This game is a cash grab by greedy, lowlife programmers; with tedious repetitive scenarios. Bosses now steal turns! You're a bunch of greedy junk programmers. This is why people stop playing games; OP the bosses, change the turn base, outright cheat. Really want to give zero stars

advertisements, shady, I used to love this game but the shady deceptive advertisements they use to lure people in should not be tolerated. Ill keep updating this post. First you try to con people thinking its a horror game now you try to lure people in thinking its a dating sim. Honestly this game along with the company needs to be taken off the market.

player, F2P, This game is quite fun. The story is enjoyable and the character is amazing too. It is quite friendly for F2P player. It's not hard to obtain SR or SSR Character and weapon. I think you should make the Online story like the offline one it would be wonderful

player, free, Its a gatcha game, but the gatcha is disappointing. Definitely not free player friendly. Been playing for about a month, but only ever get 1 ssr char. Its quite a shame, because we get to see all this new ssr char, but the chance of actually getting them without paying is pretty slim. I'll play it for a little longer, but i think at some point i'll just delete it and play other game.

time, long, So far, so good! I have waited a long time to play this game.
advertisements, misleading, The game itself is really good, and I would be giving this game 5 stars if it weren't for the misleading advertisements.

stuff, scamming, Just bad. I'm not gonna talk about the scamming stuff as you already probably know it. The story is just not worth reading. There is no balance between classes. The odds that you pull a character which is SSR(best tier in the game) are really low. The story ends quickly, and the online story is just terrible. Overall not worth your time since after a couple weeks you would probably get stuck and won't be able to make progress.

scam, blatant, Nothing like the advertisements for it in any way. This is highly illegal for a "premium" (as in having to pay money for it) game, but as the company isn't based in North America, all I can really do is be disappointed by the product and remain disgusted with the blatant scam that youtube will strongly regret advertising in less than a year.
team, many, I love this game. Art style is great, gameplay is good, every player can make many build team. But please, increase rate gacha SSR for character.
game, Great, Great game!!!

beginning, very, Great RPG, NOT monster catching. The monsters you catch in the very beginning are quickly out valued by the ones you summon. The story is amazing and there are weekly mini stories to complete after the main story is done. The game outside of the story is mostly idle, you come in once a day to collect the gains, place platoons for war, and complete quests, the rest of the time is spent either spending mana for stories, or collecting from the tower. Very fun, you progress quickly without much cost

The story is amazing and there are weekly mini stories to complete after the main story is done. The game outside of the story is mostly idle, you come in once a day to collect the gains, place platoons for war, and complete quests, the rest of the time is spent either spending mana for stories, or collecting from the tower. Very fun, you progress quickly without much cost

character, ssr, The game is both fun and stressful specifically when you're trying to summon an ssr character because the drop rates are so low other than that the game is pretty awesome
advertising, False, False advertising!?
advertisement, False, False advertisement
hope, much, I don't have much hope for this game, to be honest I'm disappointed because it's very difficult to get ssr.

gem, purchased, "purchased gem only" banners are skeezy enough, but to put it on a beginner banner that goes away after a week? That's Garbage.

years, past, I've been looking for a game like this for years. I havent been much of a gamer over the past 10 or 15 years with the ps2 days. This game gives me that nostalgia feeling and for only a dollar to feel that agian. pricless!

RPG, generic, Evertale is good, but not what the adds portray it as. It starts as a generic RPG and slowly, (and i mean slowly) become a gacha with a great story. The offline portion is good for getting characters leveled early on and getting used to the games mechanics. After the offline the story opens up to a far more compelling script and the game is relatively generis with its resources. (but not so much that it cant turn into an ocean of debt for a whale quickly) Strategy beats MOST pay to win.

advertisements, False, False advertisements on instagram got me to buy this game, but it's not even close to what was in the ad. I feel scammed. Even if I wasn't expecting something else, this game is pretty bad, or at least it's first 10 minutes, and so underwhelming. Do not waste your money on this!!
advertising, False, False advertising. It's not and never has been anything like the adds. It's not even remotely horror themed. Played it in the past and reinstalled it thinking it was a different game.....

anime, strange, Your ads in no way reflect what your game really is. The ads make it look like a Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy Style game but when you play it's a strange angle anime RPG monster collector game, like a Pokemon ripoff. Your ads look like an amazing game. Are those just animations that you created or is there a real product out there that have some of those elements?

gameplay, Decent, Decent gameplay thus far, im on chapter 4 now and I will change my review if my opinion changes. I can already tell that the gacha is strong with this game, there's a large power difference between gacha characters and free ones. While there are quite a few cheap 1-3$ beginners packs to purchase, the vast majority of purchases are certainly not cheap per gacha roll. I like the game so far, it's not the most f2p friendly but i think I will be fine now that I got my 6 star carry.

mess, sad, this game is just a sad and pathetic mess their story is so bad they literally had to make fake ads to make it interesting looking so people would buy it. Secondly, 90% of the sprites and sound effects are all stolen from other games which is pure laziness and theft, not even halfway through the BEGINNING you know its a scam bacause you are not even out of the first area when the game shoves ads in your face telling you to buy their aMaZiNg deals. Scum thats all there is left to say pure Scum.

gacha, Good, Good gacha game. like Pokemon but with b o o b a lol.
aspect, multi, Story is pretty solid, it's not hard to progress if your willing to sink 15 minutes a day into it. The multi-player aspect is definitely P2W, but if you're willing to grind you'll be able to still be competitive. Only drawback is that weapons and characters are all in the same pool, so summons are really hit or miss. Other than that, this is pretty enjoyable for the casual player like myself.

The game itself was created shortly after the coronavirus existed and slammed Japan so think about the situation... it's a great game been playing 7 months f2p so yeah...üëç

story, new, Don't waste your money&time on this game. No new story after 10 months, no new side events after 2.5 months, but the devs just keep releasing new SSR every 2 weeks with OP moves and recycled animations. The devs are dishonest and have no respect for the players, so don't hope for much, or just skip this trash game altogether!

style, Nice, Nice art style. Sprites are well done. Controls are easy. The dialogue is readable! Which is a huuuuge deal to enjoying a good rpg. It's not like pokemon, despite what some of the reviews say. Yes you can catch different "monsters", and some of them evolve. But that's where the similarities stop. (Feels more like Shin Megami Tensei series to me.) Probably spent about $25 to get a decent team. (So the gacha drop rates don't seem super absurd.) Overall, I would recommend

advertising, False, False advertising at its finest! The ad I saw for this on YouTube showed it off, like another reviewer had said, as a 8 bit style horror game. After downloading the addition files and such and loading into the game I was immediately upset that I even paid a buck for this game. If it was something I'd even enjoy playing I might give it a try, but the style it's self is so far from anything I typically enjoy and the grumpy was I have from being duped means I'm uninstalling right away. üò†
advertising, false, This is false advertising, just another gacha game that tricks you into thinking its a horror game in the style of pokemon. For shame.
story, Great, Great story. Not 5 stars because the false advertising. Mana system sucks.

characters, good, Is it too difficult to obtain SSR as a f2p player. I can't get enough of this summon rate. To be honest, I tried it again and again to get at least one SSR, but it doesn't work because the game is so selfish in terms of providing good characters.  I started playing this game in 2019, but I didn't get even one SSR, so I quit.  I tried it again in 2020 because I was still a gacha addict, but I didn't get a single SSR, and it's still the same in 2021.  So 3star for now! Still hoping XD
advertisement, false, I downloaded the game thinking it was just like the ad but it's not. Also instead of making the game with a D-pad controller layout it's a point and click. Completely false advertisement
experience, dark, I was expecting a dark pokemon experience. Their adds suggested that was the case. The 6 bucks I put into the game was a complete waste.

reason, only, First of all. Fix your ads. Your game trailer is extremely misleading and not what the game itself presents to be at all. The only reason why I downloaded it is because of the "horror" aspects shown in the trailer. But the trailer is not even close to representing the actual game. On the other hand I did enjoy it. So I'll give it three stars.

game, Great, Great game but the controls on how you move is just down right annoying! You go one way and it darts the other! A toggle at the bottom left for movement would be great. Otherwise a great game.

Plus it cost me. 99 cents so not even a free game to play.

story, initial, The initial story is great, had the classic RPG feel. Complete that and then "Act 2" amd further is no longer a free moving open map and it takes energy to progress. This energy is the same energy that everything else uses. Normally this would be fine, but you get 300 max, and everythimg costs either 27 or 50. So very little play time once the first part of the story is completed. I never would have paid for it had I known the story would eventually be restricted play time.

I thought I was getting a kind of grimdark pokemon-esk game but got something more akin to final fantasy in game play and aesthetics.

The game works well and it has a very pretty style, but it isn't advertising itself accurately to the actual game. It's very disappointing.

This is so bad if anyone wants to play this don't it's a gimmick and trap sure it was fun- ish but common on make it free to play of you are gonna have pay to win aspects
game, great, great game!
rip, stupid, It's not even like the adds at all no horror things it's just some stupid pokemon rip off that wants your money
monsters, captured, Ads are misleading, captured monsters are strictly weaker than gacha pulls. Don't bother with a game that can't advertise properly.
things, extra, games cool but I already paid for the game for extra things in the game
stuff, good, top for now, looks like 3d copy of very good 2d game ,but still like it a lot ,nothing wrong with copying good stuff and improveing it
game, ybis, Dont play ybis game, waste of time, could of been better, just a bad game and dev/support never respond. Its a scam.

lag, little, A little lag but otherwise it's a great rpg

events, dead, 2 stars because the game community is dead events are recycled and the only thing worthwhile is the storyline, although the post game extra storyline is almost totally garbage. Would have been better to just add a replay option with enemies at higher levels. Like a suedo new game+ system.

ads, creepy, You should just delete the creepy ads that scam people into playing the game.
graphics, Great, Great graphics and gameplay
case, blatant, Is nobody going to mention the fact that this game is a blatant case of false advertising? The YouTube ads make you think this is an 8 bit horror rpg, but it's got a bland story with half 2.5d models and combat that almost completely rips off every Pok√©mon game. Not even worth the singular dollar I paid, and honestly, I kinda want a refund after realizing this isn't what I paid for.

loss, scripted, I absolutely despise the character you start playing as. I immediately refunded this game after intensionally failing on that "hero comeback" section after the scripted loss in the destroyed village you fight the demon lady in, I'd like to imagine the main guys dying there and that makes me happy

ads, cool, Why are there cool ads popping up that look like a horror/Pokemon game but this is the game it links to? It's nothing like the ads and it's disappointing
time, good, having a good time so far , I just started
game, good, It's probably a good game but I downloaded this game expecting it to be like the ads. It's nothing like the ads. No horror aspect like the ads portray nothing. Any review that says other wise is a bot or lying.
account, lost, Messaged support to recover lost account and zero response
dope, pretty, Game is pretty dope if you're a fan of jrpg
content, more, To a point very quickly with nothing left to do game needs more content
thing, same, Straight to the point, this game is lame due to lack of uniqueness. All the skill name just repeating and do the same thing. Ssr just merely having 2 or more same skill merged with common units. RnG in the game even worse than fgo that claim the title of hell gacha. 10 summon for 6 time just having a bunch of weapons n 2 sr character/beast cause me still stuck at the same story boss even I raised them higher than boss's level for 2 weeks. Doubt I will continue this any longer...

ads, Misleading, Misleading ads. if u wanna play a creepy pokemon game this isnt it . its just a regular pokemon knock off not creepy at all. If you went to go download this game after seeing its horror themed ads you'll be Severely disappointed because the actual gameplay has no horror/scary/creepy anything i even played through the first few chapters hopeing to eventualy see what was shown in the ads. Even tho actual gameplay isnt so bad In the end my time was wasted because its not the game from the ads :(

assets, stolen, the advertisements are stolen assets from other games. Nor is there an element of visceral horror. You pay- for a strategy game which can only be beaten by solving a puzzle of mechanics preset and unchanging for that fight- the frustration makes you turn to the gacha for units- and though this isn't the answer- its VERY stacked against you for any characters you want. The side stories aren't bad- but the "open world" is very empty.

game, good, I've only played this game once and I hated it, mainly because of the ads. As a OMORI fan, the game looked like such a good mobile game, with the RPG and Psychological Horror elements, the art, it looked like the perfect game, then I tried it. And I was really disappointed, it was nothing and I mean 0% like the ads, I know there are clickbait ads but these ads in particular made me get the game in a heartbeat. Very disappointed. Just play an actual good mobile game instead of this.

game, made, It's a well made game with great artwork and a good battling system. Unfortunately some of the boss battles give unfair advantages as where my heroes could not even damage the boss once which made me switch to different strategies. Some of the levels feel like there's absolutely nothing when you look at it. It's mostly trees, grass and water, I'd like to see like abandoned houses and other props that can make the game feel alive.

advertisement, False, False advertisement, don't buy if you watched the ads, just a gacha anime game.
rpg, based, Nothing like the ads, is also a pay to win gatcha game and is also a game you play to play. Just another turn based rpg. Not horror like advertised. All in all, disappointing.

intro, long, very fun easy to play long intro tho
monsters, caught, Was ok to good in the beginning If you like the story or not, but... The ad from YouTube is completely false, I thought something would come later Also in one of the pics here in the store, that monster does not evolve the far, ya can't, here is a limit And catching any of the monsters was absolutely a waste of time And implementation It's not a draw in for the game The caught monsters can't get far, some can a bit more But in no way compare to drawing special ones with gems

style, f2p, Paid a dollar for it so I thought it might be aa fun indie style pokemon game with waifu art. Instead it was another f2p gacha style. Turns out it only costs money on Google, it's free on apple. Tat would take it to 3stars for me. The 1star is for false advertising, as I just saw an advertisement on YouTube for this game where they made it look like a Pokemon creepypasta with almost nothing relevant to the game even being mentioned. It even started with a generic Pokemon gen 1 sprite.

concept, cool, pretty cool concept
codes, redeem, The game is good but it will be much better if you add redeem codes, something like that since this game is gacha and to make it for fun and enjoyable, anyways this game is lit!
game, solid, pretty solid game
part, second, The second part of the game is horrible. Not worth the time. If they didn't change things for no reason it'd be playable.
fantasy, medieval, although the ad was deceiving. (I thought this was undertale mobile), I'm immensely enjoying the game. it's less undertale, and more medieval pokeman/dbz Dokan battle/classic final fantasy. the story is gripping, it's gameplay reminds me of SNES rpgs like old final fantasy or chrono trigger, and even though they pull you in with... shall we say... chesty character summons.... the app is fully worth the 99 cents.

footage, actual, It's pretty good a lot better than what the commercial says that's for sure Word of advice use actual gameplay footage
feel, Nostalgic, Nostalgic but new feel! love it!
game, good, A good game in general but has deceptive marketing. The game is very limited in monster catching and more of a general rpg. Offline story mode is pretty good but beyond that it's ok. I just wished the game portrayed more of what they advertised instead of using misdirection in their advertising to give you an idea of an entirely different game.

rates, Terrible, Terrible summon rates you might spend hundreds of dollars and get nothing, because there is no pity and the rates are extremely low.
game, awful, Its summoning stuff doesn't work u can't ask for a refund after less than 8hours awful game for such a over used idea with great art

videogame, real, I remember when all games were 99cents, I had no problem then. and the games weren't like this, it feels like a real videogame
advertising, false, Never played this game, only viewed the ads. Not sure why my account has it at 5 stars, but I assume that may have been my error. Unfortunately, I have to give it one star b/c the story in the ads is not in the game and false advertising is bad.
advertisements, cool, I really hate how it keeps showing really cool advertisements for a game that doesn't exist and is completely separate. Would've loved to played the game from Evertale ads, but real game itself is a fairly plain app that's quickly boring.

version, fun, it's a more fun version of Pokemon ü§£ü§£ü§£
advertising, false, Ads are false advertising.
review, bad, The game itself isn't bad. It's kinda pokemon-gacha styled, but not too bad. Honestly the bad review is because of the clickbait ads they use now to lie to people. I almost started playing again thinking maybe they'd added content. But nope. They just lied to get downloads. It really is a shame. To see companies get this desperate, when they have a half decent game to start. Probably would have had better actually adding content, instead of funding false advertising. Oh well.

rank, highest, Put 30 hours into the game, got 1 SR Character....that's not even the highest rank you can get. Only download if your going to spend cash after buying. And BTW, you can't add another account if you have bad luck. Even if it's your friends email, I think they track your ip address. Only people playing this game are whales, not real gamers.

catcher, waifu, Scam advert, bought the game expecting something else. It's not necessarily bad if a waifu catcher is your thing, but that's not what I paid for
moves, different, Would be a killer game if the characters had different moves & abilities. All their moves, save for the really rare characters, r the same. U even have a time-worn but solid base to do something with: the elements. U got em, then USE 'em! Otherwise y even have the elements n there. Also, character limit break potions... Need more chances to get them. All n all, good game. Its just the attack base y i didnt give it a 5. Idk, change a name, throw n an explosion, some lightning... Something

game, neat, Very neat and interesting little game. Worth theoney if you wish to spend it. I love the characters and the design. It is simple, yet the battles are also fun stressful. Very strategic as well, in terms of what moves to make with what fighters you have. I love the diversity of all the monsters and the ability to evolve them as well!! 10/5 stars. Not accurate with the ads though. It's not a horror quest game.

story, good, pretty good story and decent game mechanics but complicated tab menu and for a game you have to purchase a lot of pay to win stuff

story, good, being able to enjoy a good story while playing a game is pretty hard to come by nowadays but I genuinely enjoyed the story so far
