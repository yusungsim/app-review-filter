update, new, Plz add the dont starve crossover to mobile soon. then ill give 5 stars but until the new update comes for mobile it stays at 4 stars from me.
classic, Amazing, Amazing classic
game, good, In general it's a really good game but they just need to update it more like they do with the PC version.
time, same, Love the game Terraria, but this version is literally unplayable with how terrible the controls are. Trying to aim is impossible, the control panel thing is somehow hard to notice and way too cluttered at the same time, items are hard to use, etc. All around awful.
game, Good, Good game but only issue is the update schedule. As of now there has been an update on pc for a Don't Starve Together update, but who knows when this update will come here. Also please if possible have a setting possibly that puts the old version of game controls up. Ever since the new controls I've just stopped due to so many mis clicks that shouldn't/weren't intended to happen due to playing on phone and my large finger just blocking all the other buttons. But these are my only issues.

years, many, I've played this game on both console and mobile for many years, and it's simply the best. One of my favorite games by far. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because you cannot cross play between both console and mobile, which isn't ideal, however I've come to terms with it, I still do wish it was possible. Other from that, this game is one of a kind, can't wait to see more 🙂

world, creative, Terraia is the type of game that can suck you in for hours at a time. The creative world, building, and crafting are so much fun! While PC is where I originally played it, bur they have made it so accessible on mobile and others its worth buying again.

challenge, new, I just bought the game, i always play terraria on pc but playing it on mobile is a new challenge for me. Im kinda clumsy with the controls but im getting used to it... it would be great if we can resize every individual controls because i dont really like the scale of it. Only the controls is the downside of this game in my perspective, and please change this for the upcoming updates.

designs, graphic, This Game is Great Journeys end update really upgraded the graphic designs This game is getting prettier
bugs, own, Fixed my own bugs so I'm editing my review: Please do not ever stop updating this game. I'll buy it again once a year just to keep up support... There's still so much you can do, and it's almost time to open up to allowing mods to become part of the main game. Pay the people who love your game and add their work to it. Moon Lord was only the beginning. It took me far too long to get into this game, but I can say with certainty that I 'get' it.

time, 3rd, This is now the 3rd time I've bought & played Terraria (PS3, PC, & now mobile). It's worth every penny. Developers that support their products like this, are far and few between. Also any mobile game that realizes the importance of controller support, is to be applauded. There's so much to do & so much content to dig up. In fact, my only sort of gripe with the game is that you can easily get mired down with your to do list. EASILY THE BEST STAND ALONE GAME PURCHASE I'VE MADE ON MOBILE.

right, tutorial, Ok I absolutely love this game it is one of the best and I have over 600 hours of playtime and I saw the one star reviews saying there's no tutorials and what I have to say is yes there is you idiots let me explain so there are not only YouTube videos but there is a tutorial right in the menu and there is one individually on the app store and sometimes you just have to learn and deal with it so stop being a baby and learn yourself or find someone or something to learn off of.
controls, old, I love the game, except, the controls. Is there a way to get old controls for mobile? Other than the controls, love it!! <3
game, Great, Great game looks just like the PC terraria worth all of the money
servers, online, I love the game, but we are like 3 to 5 updates behind! The don't starve together update is nowhere here, online servers like Terraria.One can't be used since they are updated and we are not, and it just makes me disappointed. This game is totally amazing though, just mad from the update loss.
account, wrong, I bought the game but am unable to play due to a bug that says I'm signed in to the wrong account t or havent purchased the game.
game, fun, I love terraria as a fun game and it has incredible weapon choices and so much to do.Keep it up developers.

confusion, multi, I want to give a 5-star review, but I can't because of their multi-player confusion. I have spent 15 minutes just trying to play this game with a friend who is not local, and every how-to video says I need to download this or sign up for that. It should be a very simple process.

stuff, cool, I love the game beat everything in master and got the Zenith. But the only bad is they give all the cool stuff to PC players and I was excited to get the cool cosmetics from a competition that some people won because they looked cool and stuff from the 1.4.3 update with the collab with Don't Starve ™️ It would be a 5 if there was the stuff listed above

versions, other, Update: hardware configuration aside, found setting the controller scheme to advanced seems to put it in line with the other versions I've played - so here we go, let's begin the adventure! Will update to 5* if they add in saves to Google account / some cloud, for fluid gameplay between multiple devices.

game, good, It's really good game, but no google drive save support (yet?), so I can't safely continue my save game on other devices if something happened to my phone. Pointless to play. Dear Dev, please make save/load (or maybe export/import save) to google drive. I refunded because of this reason.

I rate this game to anyone who likes survival games and boss battles.

game, favorite, I unfortunately don't have Terraria on mobile but I wanted to rate it. It's my favorite game to play it's got everything a good survival crafting game can offer. Also not to mention there is so many items and enemies that I could play for a week and never be bored like it's so addictive.

games, specific, With the controller support, it plays better than before, something more comfortable about a controller experience, as compared to a touch experience when it comes to specific games. However sometimes I do forget that mobile games are made with touch controls in mind rather than HID support. In any case, as far as my opinion goes this has revived my enjoyment for Terraria.

game, Good, Good game but i hope 1.4.1 is on mobile :)
ui, old, I love the game but I would like to have a option to change back to the old ui even tho it has less functionality, and it seems it would be compatible with a controller over bluetooth but it is not. I feel that the differences between mobile and pc are big enough to make it worth having both.

port, great, For what its worth its a great port of terraria but if you want to actually have fun playing this game use a controller.
scheme, new, At first I hated the new control scheme but after getting used to them, I beat the game and I am currently doing an expert run and it is HARD but I'm getting through slow and steady also I have around 85 hours Edit: all my progress randomly got deleted so now it's 2 stars instead of five

game, Best, Best game ever made! Something for everyone. But please update to match PC! We have been waiting so long.
life, whole, The Game of my whole life, can't live without it. I started playing Terraria in the year 2019, skl. 💕
fun, much, Because it so much fun
cannon, super, i dont know is it just me but compare to the pc versions some items are missing like the super star cannon,l
game, Great, Great game but you buy it on the other platforms bosses are harder on mobile but great game.

connection, stable, Money down the drain. I can't play the game until it verifies that I actually bought it from the play store. I have logged into my account and opened the game. I have stable connection. I have tried everything and it still does not work. This used to be my favorite game and I used to play it all the time but when I redownloaded it ever since it hasn't worked at all. I was looking forward to this a lot and it is just such a let down.

versions, mobile, The mobile app versions controls are pretty annoying to use at first but if you put a bit of time into it then they should be fine, I think that the PC version is by far the best so if you have access to it I recommend getting terraria for PC, if we are talking about the gameplay itself then I would say it's one of the best games to ever be made, i definitely recommend getting terraria you will have a great time, that's all

games, new, There's a lot of people complaining about the controls being too hard and the game having no tutorial. To them, I say: learn. It's like all new games. U gotta learn to walk before you can fly. This game is amazing, and has done a lot for me mentally. I love the moonlord update and I hope the don't starve collab comes to mobile as well! (I play on 3 platforms as well btw)
game, moblie, This game is cool and all the but I wish mods can be on moblie but still great game

tier, top, around the time where you could mine placed wood with an axe, is when I started playing. This game does everything right. From the graphics to the mechanics and especially the music and atmosphere. The game overall is definitely top tier, each little thing is amazing. There is so much to explore and everytime you find something new, you get a feeling, and that's really addictive. Even when there's a update coming out soon, it's worth the wait. Do play! ❤️

content, new, I love what the devs have done with this. I dropped the game a while back after completing the game and I came back to it and lo and behold, tons of new content. 10/10, would definitely recommend.
touch, Horrible, Horrible touch controls. If you dont have a computer or console, just dont buy it. It will probably be more worth it. Instead, you could buy another game, there are a lot of games for the same price, which are better. Game is pretty solid, but the controls ruin it. I guess the PC version is 5 stars, but the mobile is 2.

game, good, Well, it's a good game overall. But the problem is it's hard to play with my friends..I wish it was easier to host and join even they're away from me...
mode, new, I bought this years ago but dropped it because the desktop version is easier to play. I recently picked up this version because I don't have time to sit at a desk and game for hours. The new journey mode makes up for the challenge of playing on mobile. Over time the controls get more familiar though I'll never pull off the fancy dodging and skill shotting possible on PC. It's been a more casual, relaxed experience. As a phone game it deserves a solid 5 stars. Congrats to the devs! Masterpiece!

game, good, Still a really good game, played it years ago and now it's even better
mode, journey, Just sucks. Switch sucks as there is no journey mode for me to practice and have, you know... FUN! Not to mention how annoying Wall of Flesh is as its to overpowered with The Hungry and HP AND, damage needs work. Until then, this game can collect DUST for all I care. I'm disappointed. Waste. Of. Money.
game, favorite, This was by far my favorite mobile game. Untill that is, the update. Controls are unrecognizable, and I cannot play at all.

games, best, That's one of the best games I have ever played I love it
fun, much, I love this game I played it on my Xbox through the Xbox game pass ultimate and I was amazed with how much fun it was. Plus Minecraft and terraria both are good games. One time Minecraft had a splash text saying "go play tarraria too" and terraria had a splash text saying "try playing Minecraft too" so I think they are both excellent game's.

update, final, I love this game im very very sad that this is the final update i rember playing with my friend on this game.well Terraria goodbye
game, good, Really good game, I invested alot of time into it as there are so much many more things to accomplish especially in comparison to minecraft as well as the addition of cloud storage and how you can bring your kitted character into your friend's world or a new one however 1 problem; there needs to be a way to rename your character because i misnamed mine 'Scopion' and i really wish to change it even if it costs coins ingame.

fun, endless, I LOVE this game, its endless fun! There are no words i know that can explain how much i love this game. Now if your wondering "Then why not give it 5 stars?" Well, recently i came upon a glitch and i don't think its fixable currently. Now when i open the app, its just a black screen, no color, no image, nothing. The only thing is the music, i can still interact with the game, but no color. The game is unplayable for me now! I tried everything, force stop, re download, everything!

game, Best, Best game 4 me
bosses, mech, I don't care if getting past the mech bosses is hard af, this is Terraria, which makes it perfect. The controls are great and the UI he's been so thought out so much so that if I didn't know better I would think Terraria was ported to pc from phones. The only thing that could improve the phone version is if someone is stubborn enough to make mod support but other than that thank you for the amazing game.

day, next, The game just bugs and i lost hours of progress i was just abot to kill the destroyer but the next day the game kept crashing and i couldnt even play so i read something and it said uninstall and re stall and google play didnt even save it so yeah thanks for wasteing hours of my life terreia.
time, first, worked well the first time I played, but now glitches by flashing the intro screen while I try to play. It's going to give me and my kids a seizure. I rarely purchase games, now I'm regretting it!
games, best, This is one of the best games ever made, period. Suggestion to players: use a bluetooth controller instead of touch controls. Bugs I've noticed for devs: if you use a controller and select an empty coin slot, then pick up an item from a chest but leave it on the cursor (not in slot or chest) then close your inventory, the item will be placed in the coin slot; also, pressing down on a staircase 1 block above a solid block will phase you through the solid block sometimes

games, favorite, Terraria is one of my favorite games. With that said, terraria on mobile sucks unless you have a controller to connect to your phone. The game runs well and is very nice on mobile, but on screen controls just suck in general. If you have a controller to pair with your phone, this will be the game to get into

update, last, 1 star waiting if the game will progress the last update wasnon 2020, lets see what will happen to the game, if he game would grow or stop, it would be sad to players if the game stops.
game, fun, Four stars it's a fun game to play on and you can do many things, but there's some things that could possibly fixed(1) I can't exactly record videos on terraria (2) it only lets me play for about an hour until it crashes(3) the multi player thing is hard to use, but overall it's very great.

problem, only, I think the only problem with this app is the fact that it doesn't connect to your 'Google play Games' account. As such, it won't save your progress on cloud, merely in the application itself.

ride, extra, If I buy a game and get told I have to have be connected to the internet to play it, I'd rather just get a refund. I love this game it plays great huge BUT tho I got it to play in an extra long car ride. Instead in greeted with a must connect to internet to play I'd like my 5$ back since I cant get back the time wasted looking at that message

game, Great, Great game! I fully recommend playing it! it's like Minecraft but 2D and with so much more in it! I honestly spend hours on it! And just love playing! I actually plan to get it on my switch for better controls! But I do have one complain, a faw years ago, I was almost to the end, and lost everything, all my saves, all my stuff, everything, I wasn't in hard, just all gone like that, it was heartbreaking, actually kept me from wanting to play again for 2 years, but still a wonderful game!

version, mobile, I love the game, problem is that I can't join my friends server just because the mobile version is a patch behind and they're using the steam version And It always says "connection timeout" error
support, universal, Add universal controller support for all gamepads. This is pretty ridiculous. Edit - 2021-10-28 - Came on to the play store, I bought this game twice already and NOW i have to buy a it a third time. I'm not doing it again. I'd Rate 0 Stars if I could.

game, fantastic, It really is a fantastic game, but one thing that relly is getting on my nerves...WHY THE HECK DOES IT NOT WORK WITH BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE LOL REFUND
tinha, backup, Terraria é um jogo incrível, jogo tanto na versão de Pc quanto na do mobile, mas uma coisa que eu não gosto é o fato de não haver backup na nuvem dos meus mundos e personagens, mas oque me deixa em dúvida é, antes tinha backup na nuvem, e eu tenho que fazer backup manualmente e isso não é prático, além de que eu pra passar os mundos para outro celular ou coisa parecido é um pouco mais chato do que eu simplesmente baixar o mundo da nuvem, tirando isso terraria é meu jogo favorito desde 2011 <3
game, amazing, It's an amazing game over-all. It took me over three months to fully see what the game had to offer, spending 4 to 7 hours on it a day. It's got enough secrets and gear to keep you captivated for a lifetime. However, there are many complications for multiplayer, especially for mobile. I actually came to the game page to try and download it onto my computer, only to have it not listed as an option. It really is too bad. I was really hoping to be able to upload my most played worlds my computer, so I'm not always trying to look into a tiny screen (which I fully understand is a given for mobile games). The point is, multiplayer's tricky; and cross-platform, forget about it. Other than that, easy 5 stars. Literally the best mobile game I've ever had the honor of owning.

I was really hoping to be able to upload my most played worlds my computer, so I'm not always trying to look into a tiny screen (which I fully understand is a given for mobile games). The point is, multiplayer's tricky; and cross-platform, forget about it. Other than that, easy 5 stars. Literally the best mobile game I've ever had the honor of owning.

game, Great, Great game, put hundreds of hours into it. The bossfights are awesome, really well made and thought out. The controls are relatively good compared to other mobile games like this and my favorite thing a out it is getting all the weapons to fight the bosses.

thing, only, I absolutely love the game.....but the only thing that made me leave one star on the game i love more than minecraft, is the fact that I used to be able to connect worlds with my brother, I have the Hotspot, he hosts, or visa versa; and it would work. We'd be able to connect worlds like that, and minecraft used to be that way too. But now they're both retarded because they updated and made it so you HAVE TO HAVE WIFI! So here's to another enjoyable game gone stupid🥂

masterpiece, rpg, this is an rpg sandbox masterpiece. thousands of items, over 25 bosses, and TONS of things to do. the only real complaint i have is the massive ui on this mobile version, makes it real hard to see.

controls, different, Game plays just like the PC version, with different controls, it is a bit harder but its your Terraria on wheels, as a builder its hard to build, but with combat it becomes a bit more fun because of the increased difficulty and learning curve, get this if you want to experience the ultimate 2D sandbox game on your phone.

game, Amazing, Amazing game would recommend it to anyone.
years, many, I have played the game since the beta and have thoroughly enjoyed it through my many years of playing the game and much more enjoy playing this than playing mine craft ( though I like minecraft don't attack me lol)
button, tutorial, Now I get why people quit because they are confused however there is a tutorial. if you go on settings you can see a tutorial toggle button. and on the top right you will see 3 buttons the the one on the left is a help button to figure out the controls btw the person you spawn with you gives help on what to do. If you are stuck then watch HappyDays on Youtube he does really good farms. Edit: forgot to say this but you can arrange your controls positon as well in settings.

game, fun, Terraria is a fun game filled with things to do. There's a progression system, there's lots of cool vanity items for you to look awesome, weapons of all kinds ranging from handguns to cat-shooting swords. There's infinite things to build, pvp, tons of mobs, and different events that certain mobs can only spawn in. There's a whole world to explore and build in. There's NPC's that you can purchase and sell items from. There are mounts that can fly and do other things, and there are also pets.

games, best, One of the best games i have ever played. The thing with terraria is that there is always something to do there are so many bosses and mobs and biomes and items and soooo much to explore and progress. I definetly recommend this game its absulutely worth your money.

player, new, This game will be good and amazing if the control like My Time at Portia or Minecraft...so hard to craft items and build anything because don't have tutorial,I'm new player but don't know what to do..so lose in this game with the control and no tutorial...please make the UI more comfortable for beginners...EDIT : MOST TERRIBLE CONTROL IN MOBILE GAMES
gameplay, good, Great Game! progression is pretty hard but has really good gameplay, pixel characters look really cool especially the bosses and this is recommended for people who want a challenge and love pixel styled games.

things, different, Always loved this game since I was a kid. And my passion hasn't changed one bit, growing up with it, I adored all the different things you could do. It almost seemed infinite. And today I still think so. The Journey's End update added so much for me to enjoy even more. I really recommend Terraria.
npcs, more, Every time I get more npcs into the game i tend to lag a ton and my frames drop so much during night time in the game no matter how low my settings are if you can please fix this game
game, worthy, The worthy game in low price

variety, great, This game is awesome. I'm not gonna ignore the fact that they've had this game up and running since 2011, and this game is hella fun. If you have not played it, you have to. The game contains a variety of weapons and mobs, along with armor. It's best for survival and adventure if you're looking for some fun, and has a great variety of bosses. It's sad to hear that ReLogic is not working on the game anymore, their game came so far, yet they had to stop. This game is a great game, you should try.

game, fun, This is a fun game and all, but the controls are pretty hard to get used to, especially when I normally play on nintendo switch. Also, the game randomly closes on me and takes me back to my home screen and I don't know why. Also, I can't select any mode except for journey. Other than these issues, great game! I would also like to see Journeys End come to console (along with lots of other people.) Great job tho. Edit: PLEASE PUT 1.4 ON SWITCH! I WOULD LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!

items, infinite, Journey mode is so amazing. You can duplicate items to have infinite items. Duplicating doesn't have storage so you can duplicate anything. And my favorite weapon is the Terrarian. I'm about to get the best sword Zenith. I recommend this game

store, whole, I think this should cost less, as when you finished with the content, you bascially can't do anything else, and there isn't any mods supporting the play store, which sucks. But aside from that the gameplay is is actually the best in the whole play store. It's like modded minecraft 2d, except it's actually good.
hours, several, Takes awhile to get hang of things. I'm talking several hours just to get to know the game. I gave in, and went to an online server to get better items without having to grind for them forever.

experience, longer, Definitely a fun longer experience
game, good, This game is such a good game from the exploration to the boss fighting. The controlls are a bit difficult but there easy to get used to. It is a lot like mincraft for the people that like mincraft but it hase way more items and way more mobs and bosses. And the fact that you can play multilayer with your friends is just awesome. This game is just soooooo good

game, favourite, My favourite game.
times, many, .I can sit down for hours and just enjoy the game. You can replay it so many times and still have stuff to do. The games a bargain on mobile considering the endless possibilities with this game. I can't lie and say there are no flaws like at times it is grindy and some biomes could have more content but I look at as not only a things for mods to work on (they have )but the grinding is a reason to continue to play. My word limit is ending but I've played since 1.2 and would DEFINITELY recommend.

game, best, This is one of the best, might be the best game I ever played. 10/10 worth the payment, extremely recommended game. It's hard at first, but once you did progress, you become very obsessed with this game and having fun with it. It is also a good game to play whenever you're free. It works excellent on poor devices

buttons, new, controls became very ridiculously annoying. attacking is very hard and my character doesnt face my line of attack on the joystick. the walk button is very tiny, the new added buttons are in the way. I didn't enjoy overall. Bring old terraria back.

layout, orignal, i think it was better with the orignal mobile layout, i mean the hud and all that feels overbearing now and before it was minimalisitic yet higly finctional. Now i feel like i have to think more before i do something, and the smaller buttons invintor are hard to push especially when im rushing for another weapon creating latency wich is bad in bosses. Im not saying revert it but atleast have a differnt mode or a whole other app altogether. Please please consider having the older layout available

school, high, I've played this version since high school. Ioved how it grew. The controls are complex when you first try out, especially when the controls changed to; of course I was used to the old ways of terraria. I love the 1.4 update now. I wish I could switch phones. I really loved that you can finally use the furniture that you made. It's fun to remodel underground cabins into your base.

levels, many, @Micheal Datchtler, your comparing a minecraft paper rip off to terraria, this game has so many levels and is such an expansive game, all I heard from your rating was, waaaaaaa I'm bad at games, how about you get to the point to were you beat the wall of flesh and then try comparing in my opinion one of the best 2d adventure action based games of all time to a rip off of paper minecraft

platforms, multiple, Love the game, I've played It for years across multiple platforms: mobile, Xbox360, PC and XboxOne. Mechanics are amazing, there's so much to do, the bosses are incredibly cool and the game is actually challenging (especially bosses, the underworld and the dungeon) unlike most games like Terraria where you can just walk through any foe almost immediately. Only gripe is that there isn't KB&M support which I'd really love to see. It'd help keep up with contenders like Minecraft + improve the game.

version, mobile, I've played terraria on Pc. It's fun, but mobile version after the update to controls just dropped the greatness, not to mention after the most recent update, my Xbox One controller cant connect to terraria. The game doesnt read inputs, tried to set the controlls manually, in-game, nothing. It just refuses to work. Until then, I'am staying uninstalled. Devs, please fix 😶

Games, amazing, Games amazing I own this game on five different platforms and they've all been an amazing experience. Soon however there will come a time where I don't play on mobile anymore as the Steam Deck isn't too far away. It's been a fun time playing on mobile tho. Much love to everyone who worked on this amazing game, I feel like my live would be different without. Considering several days of my life have been spent playing this. Thanks again for making my favorite game.

ones, important, Needs keyboard/mouse support. Playing on chromebook only few of the keybinds work and important ones like inventory dont work, forcing the player to click the inventory button with the cursor. Things like this are the reason my rating is what it is, other than that great game.

update, final, Love this game on console, so was really excited to play on mobile! Been loving playing on mobile while awaiting the console's final update! The ONLY negative I have is that it is not possible to transfer save data between phones if you upgrade or change handset... Add the ability to access saved games across all platforms and I'll add a 5th 🌟!

balance, well, During my isolation, Terraria is the recommended to play its fun and addictive, Gameplay is chef's kiss, Combat is good, Enemies is well balance, Creativity is wonderful! Beating my first expert mode felt good like the suffering, dying multiple times, building a ton of houses for the pylons, RNG really hates me and defeating all bosses including new two bosses is the worth of time and experience. And maybe I go try beat master mode and died about 2 minutes by a slime. Go for it buy it. NOW,NOW

controls, good, Personally, game is okay but, experience-wise, it's difficult to control movement and aiming compared to PC. I don't think it's good to play this in the phone as you need good controls to perfect the aiming to hit enemies precisely and movement to avoid attacks. I would like to request a refund for this please.
games, other, Multiplayer drew me in. You just have to do the same and update your other games such as Portal Knights. You abandoned it. It had so much potential and deserves an update to the complete version on PC.

game, best, 100% best game EVER ive been playing on console since 2014 so it has changed alot and i would 100% recommend it and also 1.4 came out on consoles too and i would also reccomend it too!
game, best, Simply amazing. Terraria may or may not be the best RPG game I've ever played, due to how complex and interesting the game mechanics are.

game, Best, Best game, made my childhood, it just great! 😎
character, main, I have fallen head over heels for this game. From the bosses to the events to the items to the crafting, I absolutely love it! Everything about it is super great and I have put over 100 hours into my main character. The only gripes I have with this game are that it crashes every couple hours, which in terms of time I spend playing this game is often. Although, it could just be my phone as I do have some experience with crashes from other games. Thanks for making this wonderful game!

Although, it could just be my phone as I do have some experience with crashes from other games. Thanks for making this wonderful game!
game, wonderful, I have fallen head over heels for this game. From the bosses to the events to the items to the crafting, I absolutely love it!

structure, simple, I want my money back. Controls are ridiculously complex, especially when you get mobbed nonstop. I don't have the time or patience to fumble with the controls long enough to build a simple structure. Lost Miner is a much better game, IMO. Same concept, only better and free to play.

tbh, great, A really great game tbh. One thing is, my controller isn't really a common brand, Minecraft detects the triggers but Terraria does not. I hope this will get fixed soon :(
