was, game, cool, it, Execelent game! I thought it was a cool game on itch.io until I found out about it on tablet. Amazing Game , good price Buy it!
is, game, fun, it, it is a really fun game, definitely worth the money. to make it better there are ZERO ads

be, game, worst, This, This might be the worst rhythm game I've ever played. I tried calibrating it over and over so I can only conclude that the game intends to punish you for actually staying on beat, so you might as well play it on mute which just makes it a subpar one button game with no purpose
is, time, first, It, Like the warning said, this game is very reliant on rhythm and keeping the beat. That being said, it's a game that have a simple control or gameplay, but really hard to master, at least for me. It is my first time buying a game. Definitely, worth my money. I'm going to stay with this game so my sense of rhythm can be corrected. Hehe.
is, game, interesting, it, Phew! I first thought it was simple when I saw it on social media where influencer plays it, it looks real simple! But after I downloaded it, and experienced, it was extremely interesting and unexpectedly hard. For me, it really is an interesting game and helps you to get the beat well. I highly recommend playing this game!
's, game, best, It, It's the best game that I ever played its worth by
's, one, good, It, It's a good one
's, game, perfect, It, This game is really fun! It's the perfect pocket rhythm game when games like Phigros and DEEMO are getting a tad boring, and also perfect for people just getting into the rhythm game genre.. I've personally been playing this game competitively on speedrun leaderboards but it's also a nice game to just relax and play when you're bored or just feel like tapping your screen to the rhythm

's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game
is, game, put, this, As someone w/ years of general Rhythm Game playing and high level Mania 4k and CH experience, I can confidently say this is an amazingly put together rhythm game. The music is all original (and very high quality) and it's simple to learn, while also having an astronomical skill ceiling. My only real issue is that touch inputs on phones are notoriously laggy (usually 200ms+) which can make the game very awkward to adjust to at first, as you often need to tap a frame or 2 earlier than you'd think.
is, game, fun, this, Bought it on PC and played it there for about an hour or so first, bought it here next just so I can play it on the go. Deceptively difficult, with a low barrier to entry, this is a very fun rhythm game that I'll be burning many hours on!
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game with good music and a welcome challenge.
's, one, favorite, That, Please out check points on the final song of world 6. Or at least let me unlock world 12. That's my favorite one
's, game, fun, it, You dont get guidance for invisible tiles like on the steam version but it's still a really fun game! Correction: just turn the graphics up ðŸ˜…
is, game, first, This, This is my first true rhythm game, and I'm enjoying waaaaaay too much than I should've. This game is addictive as heck.

's, game, best, it, I love this game it's the best rythm game for mobile it can be hard sometimes but it's still fun
's, game, good, it, Really love this game more then my ex but besides that it's a really good game if you like rhythm games
is, game, great, this, I think this is a great game! I notice I have to calibrate kinda often while having a session but I don't mind that too much. What would take it to 5 stars for me is maybe a built in screen recorder because I'd love to share my perfect runs with my friends!
is, game, best, This, This is the best rhythm game I ever bought it but I'm not recommend for kids under 10 because it has a super extreme gameplay very nice game :D
was, proof, finished, it, A charming, wonderful one-button rhythm game I have adored ever since it was just a finished proof-of-concept. You will move your way through many well-crafted stages with custom music and heaps of love, all with the brutal unforgivingness that makes it all the more worth it. Ever since the full release, the game is beautiful whose graphics complement the experience with so much room for creativity and expression. I love this game. I even have it on Steam too! Much love from the UKSRT folks!
's, game, fun, It, It's really fun game and i playing this game when i'm bored and i'll give 5 starts
is, game, best, This, This is the best rhythm game that I have played i would recommend it
's, mechanics, simple, it, The game is awesome despite it's simple game mechanics. If you like rhythm games then this game would be good for you.
'm, player, regular, I, I love the game (I'm a regular PC player) but it's awful on mobile. I have the latest 120hz phone (S20 Ultra) and the game is very choppy. Big disappointment. Edit: This is resolved - amazing!
is, fun, much, it, I like how much fun it is. It's a great game for a lot of people. Sime levels are so much fun like 4-X. Just some levels are just plain hard and not fun to play. (Specifically 3-X) Other than that it's a great game

is, time, third, This, This is my third time playing through this game. It is a phenomenal rhythm game with amazing, and unique music as well as a creative but easy to understand concept. The graphics are a little downgraded compared to the computer version but that's to be expected I think, the game still looks wonderful and keeps essentially all of its charm.

was, challenge, good, this, As gamer i can say this was a good challenge i still dont have some speedruns done but still thanks for all the gameplay good work also it got uptade soo thats a suprise gg
is, game, good, This, [Never mind, the bugs have been fixed :)] This is a very good game, with very interesting mechanics all throughout! Simple to pick up yet hard to master. I have always loved this game, ever since first finding it over 2 years ago.
am, fan, huge, I, I am a huge fan. I will buy this game on every platform.
is, game, only, this, I have deleted all the others.   Clever mechanic and visuals. Fun and addictive, great to share with people. frustrating enough to keep you playing and fun enough/ enough of a skill barrier to keep you coming back.   any time i need a 5-10 min break this is the only game I need.
be, thing, best, they, Fun, addicting, occasionally frustrating, this game is simple and fun to play. If every developer could make these kinds of games for the price range of &lt;$2, they could be the best thing to happen to the app store.
be, stars, easy, it, Great music, a fast pace and lots of fun, which makes it easy to get drawn in.   Had enough fun for it to be an easy 5 stars to give, but this game clearly has lots more potential for future updates.  Best 60p spent on an app in a long time.
