is, story, nice, This, This is a nice little story! It gave me pleasant flashbacks to the old Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books that I loved years ago. (What's more, I've been playing it in German for language-learning purposes. Conversational and new scifi vocabulary! It's great!)

is, game, fun, It, It is a really fun adventure game and I really like it. You can also go to Peek mode and have a new character Taylor or ... I forgot the other oneüòÑüòÑüòÄ
is, concept, interesting, this, I've only been playing for a day, but this is such a interesting concept, and Taylor is a really likeable character. I'm fascinated to see where it goes! I read about it on an article by The Live Life, they said it was one of the top 5 mobile games worth playing :) Then onyl criticism I'd say (from my limited experience this far) would be the option to check in on him occasionally? Even if it is limited to the game providing you with the opportunity, rather than being able to do it whenever.
is, way, amazing, This, This is an amazing way to use the unique qualities of phones to make a game! This series deserved so much better... ...and it's getting so much better! The devs got their IP back from big fish (speculation) so expect amazing things!
is, one, awesome, this, The concept of the game is good, I never played story driven games before, but this is an awesome one to begin with. Although the dialogue is lackluster at times you still get captivated by Taylor's faith. Overall a good story, that's worth the money, gonna buy the second game also.
's, story, short, it, Not what I thought it would be. Not a game, it's a short story.
's, experience, great, It, Fantastic game, and they have taken feedback and developed the game further with quality of life features and the like. It's a great story experience, especially for the Sci fi horror lover.
is, story, simple, This, Not a cyoab .. Not a game ... The parts that make you wait do not build suspense since you arent given either clear choices at times or illogical/piss poor choices .... This is a simple and linear story that lacks immersion and is weakly entertaining ... I would like a refund ..this is not worth paying for...
is, level, whole, this, EDIT:: just finished a replay after all these years, and I had just as much fun this time as I did the first time. I'm excited to play these games all over again ‚ù§Ô∏è It is so easy to believe you are talking to a real person in real time; this is a whole new level of immersive! Truly a unique and incredible app that feels like a crazy experience! I felt a connection with the person on the other end instantly. Would highly recommend !!

's, game, short, it, You really start to feel as if you are texting a real person. The only complaint I have is that it's a fairly short game, I beat it in 3 days. Other than that it's perfect. üíØ percent worth the 2 dollars.
'm, coach, good, I, I love this lol I actually made it to the end safely my first try. I'm such a good coach. Whoever created this game, keep going. You've done damn good job
's, game, excellent, It, It's an excellent game... I'd really love to see Taylor in another game, similar if not exactly like this one. Just with a new story. I genuinely cared about Taylor, and wanted to get him/her home. It's an amazing game, and I'm gonna play it through again. I was sad when I ended the story. Time for another round.

's, idea, interesting, It, It's an interesting idea for a game, but it turns out you have very little choice really, if you attempt to change the path too much he rebels. Later trying to not get killed seems tricky, as choices are so arbitrary, sometimes only changing the strength of your response. I also found the main protagonist's voice a little unconvincing
was, take, welcome, it, Now a classic, it was a welcome new take on text only adventure games from the late 70s/early 80s when it was released. Both suspense and replay value are there.

are, stories, good, they, I have downloaded and played all of the Lifeline games because they are good stories with good commentary. I am looking forward to more!
be, story, solid, this, excellent story so far, my only complaint is that on my device, the text sometimes goes past the bottom of a text block, so i can't read the last few lines of what is being said. this definitely detracts from the story allot... if it weren't for that, this would be a solid 5 star story
was, game, EXCELLENT, This, This was an EXCELLENT game. it started good and only got better.
is, game, best, it, Bought this three years back, and still love it. I don't know why people are being so grumpy about the storyline; it is the best sci-fi text based game there is, in my opinion. The story is so engaging and makes you feel attached to the protagonist, unlike most out there. Buy it, you won't regret. Don't mind the negative reviews.

's, fun, cheap, it, I enjoyed this interactive, real time story. Being forced to wait for messages, as you guide the protagonist, was the right call (albeit fast play and rewind options become available after the first play through). Note it's quite short, you don't have a huge amount of genuine options/alternatives and it's actually quite hard to kill the person you're guiding. Bear this in mind and the limited replayability it means and you won't be disappointed - it's a bit different and good, cheap fun.
is, midget, boorish, He, After three days I uninstalled it. The game's premise is great, but Taylor is an idiot...seriously,..he is stupid beyond belief and that quickly gets annoying.  If Taylor were a 14 year old girl, it would be far more believable. There is nothing about his demeanor, dialog or decision making ability that would suggest that he is even remotely educated.   Also, the dialog feels more like he is simply narrating in real-time, which is counter intuitive to text messaging. At one point the messages were literally a play-by-play of him reaching for some food with a contraption he fashioned out of spare parts.   I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get past the physical gymnastics that are require to perform such a task, while apparently typing at the same time.   Also, the interaction between you and this moron is stupefying. It didn't take long before I began to dislike Taylor...a lot! He is a boorish mental midget who struggles with unbelievably simple decisions; like going clockwise or counter-clockwise.   Lastly, Taylor is not only stupid, but he is meek. Seriously, quit whining about your whittle sore shoulder and man up! What a candy ass.

was, fun, real, it, Loved the game, it was real fun, it took me 2 tries to beat it and I might give it another go to find the other endings
is, type, normal, this, Wonderful. I got so into it, even though this isn't my normal game type. The sound is great too
is, story, fantastic, This, This is such a fantastic story! I've been so entrapped and excited to hear from Taylor! I don't typically do reviews for games, but if you're looking for a text adventure give this a try, it's totally worth it! I would for sure give more than 5 stars if I could.
is, game, great, This, purchases. This is a great game that makes toy think about your next move,
's, game, great, It, It's a great little game! Short but engaging, especially at the end I

was, game, good, This, This was a really good game! The story was great and i really felt
is, game, simple, This, This is a very simple "game." You read text messages and choose one of two
's, version, digital, It, options to continue the story. It's basically a digital version of the
's, part, best, that, Taylor is someone I started to truly care about and that's the best part of
's, way, cool, It, It's a really cool way of delivering a story, and app ran perfectly on my phone. Most dialogue options only have one real option though and leads you to it. Sometimes you'll try to pick option B and be given an argument against it over and over til eventually it just says you're going to do option A. At one point this went for 4 attempts. Maybe there's other endings I missed but I tried replaying and picking the opposite choices only to find most of the time I was on the exact same track. Bit frustrating
is, reminder, great, it, Lifeline is a great story,  you can play at your pace, and it is a great reminder of the old chose your adventure books. Highly recommended.
is, story, interactive, It, This is not really a game. It is an interactive story and I thought it was really good.
's, premise--, cool, It, It's a really cool premise-- you're in contact with a space explorer whose ship crashed on a planet. It's a choose your own adventure via conversations with them. It also takes place in "real time" meaning that you can't play the game all at once. The explorer will be "busy" and you could wait hours to hear from them. That made it feel more realistic. However, in certain threads of the gameplay, you will tell the explorer to do something and they will wind up doing whatever they want, which defeats the purpose of the game. Additionally, you could wait several hours for a reply only for it to be the explorer saying "I'm still alive can't talk!" And there isn't anything fun or interesting about the interaction and then you have to wait another several hours. Because of this I would say great premise, poor execution. Not really worth spending money on.
was, game, interesting, It, It was an interesting game that lasted... Maybe 2 hours.. can get a better game that lasts longer than that for $2... Maybe worth $.50 imo since it was so short. It was mildly entertaining, not much detail in the story though.
is, experience, interactive, This, Remember reading those "choose your own adventure" style books when you were younger? This is basically a MUCH more interactive and personal experience. Completed it three times, and each time was as much of a tense, emotional journey as the last.

is, game, good, This, This is a good game with a captivating story. Having played text based games before, I found the game immersing and well laid-out.
was, playthrough, enjoyable, It, If you like visual novels you'll probably like this game. It was an enjoyable playthrough although relatively short.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game. Very fun and good story. Your choices don't really affect anything except sometimes you die. Taylor is stupid, when he was complaining that his compass wasn't working I wanted to say " Yeah because your not on earth! Compasses point to EARTHS magnetic North pole, so unless the moon your on is exactly.the same it's not gonna work!"
is, game, excellent, This, This is an excellent game. There's a great story here, and your choices make a difference. Get ready to die once or twice, but it makes success sweeter.
being, experience, best, it, The original Lifeline. I've played this game long ago, but to this day I remember it being possibly the best experience I have ever from playing a mobile game. I would definitely recommend everyone even remotely interested in interactive stories to give this a try. Btw, the direct sequel to this here is Lifeline: Silent Night, which isn't as long or good as the original, but still something I would recommend playing if you liked this.
was, game, heartwrenching, This, This was definitely the most heartwrenching game I have ever played in a LOOOONG time. I actually came to know Taylor and become friends with him I feel like. I know it sounds weird but thats what this game does to you.....the ending gave me goosebumps or at least the ending that I got, definitely gave me goosebumps....this was too amazing and perfect in every way....going back in in a few days...need a break, I lost a good friend...
was, experience, counterintuitive, It, It was a fun, if times counterintuitive experience, but I managed to get the best ending in a couple days.
is, game, based, This, This is a text based game. Story is compelling and engaging. I played through in 3 days time. I might replay it to explore alternate story lines.
is, game, awesome, This, This is an awesome game I am never disappointed people who say this is boring don't know what they are talking about and trust me you have to keep playing *Spoiler if you die you can make a different choice and get closer to finding out what comes next I've played all the others as well and I'm never disappointed 2017

is, game, awesome, This, This is an awesome game and I love the design, slightly limited options at times yet overall a true 5 star game
's, game, great, it, I'm stil trying to save him but it's a great game! It doesn't let you sit in front of it the whole day, because you have to wait for his answers, I like that.
is, game, great, It, It is a great telltale game
is, game, telltale, It, It is a great telltale game
is, time, first, This, This is the first time I've ever played a game like this & I didn't think I'd really get into it but I did! I actually found myself wanting to hear back from "Cadet Taylor" & checking my notifications. I even went back to see what happens when I respond in different ways. Good game!! I'm off to play Lifeline: Silent Night now!
is, game, good, This, Wow don't. Finally saved that slack ass moron. Is the writer that simple minded, or just the character? This is not a good cellphone game. This is not a time waster, this is a constant interruption over and over. Will NOT be getting anymore of these "games".

been, sucker, absolute, I, Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Taylor's personality is the right mix of snark and worry and humour and vulnerability. Really brings out the mother hen and best friend in you. So glad a friend recommended this game to me! (plus I've always been an absolute sucker for space and science - I enjoy Taylor's little geeking out sessions). As a plus point - T's gender is kept ambiguous, so you could imagine 'em to be anything.
's, story, wonderful, It, It's a wonderful story that I'd recommend to anyone who likes text based games
is, game, great, This, Amazing story it has multiple endings if you love mystery sci-fi and reading you should check this out. This is a great game for those with an imagination and to think and visualize the alien world is amazing l. Would recommend
is, game, great, This, This is a great game
is, game, best, It, I love love love this game. It is the best game I have ever played.  Only problem is its short. Maybe you could have something happen on the escape pod  and we can keep going. Edit: the lifeline series currently consists of 7 stories, all costing $3 each. Maybe have a bundle/season pass thing for cheaper, or at least group similar characters together, like the 3 stories with Taylor.
was, experience, immersive, It, This was awesome. It was truly an immersive experience : something that many games try to achieve but don't.
's, game, fast, It, Great adventure in what feel like real time events. It's not a fast game, it's not a make your own adventure..you are a guide to a very unfortunate space traveller. For the money it's worth it.

was, game, cool, This, This was a cool game but after completing it, it does daily pop ups telling you to play more and rate it which you can't disable.
was, cheesy, pretty, some, Really interesting game. But I wish it was more nerve wrecking like I want to feel how much trouble hes in. There humor in this game and the way he talks just kind seems like its another day for him. And some of the dialogue was pretty "corny",and "cheesy". But overall if you have the time its pretty good to waste time on.
is, adventure, fantastic, It, It has been more than a year since I first played this, and the story seems to have developed quite a bit! It is a fantastic adventure and you really (surprisingly) start to care about the character, his choices, your choices and his survival! Gripping story played out over a couple of weeks for me. Well worth the money.
is, game, amazing, This, Riveting from beginning to end. Amazing storytelling, engaging story, and so many twists, you're never sure of what's happening. This is an amazing "game" that is unique in it's type. It was worth every penny and I am sorry to see the story end. I cannot wait for more!!!
is, story, multiple, This, I liked text adventures back in the day. This is a multiple choice tree-structured story rather than the type using objects and verb-noun commands. Good concept though. You play in spurts of just a few minutes with waiting time between. Good for fighting boredom while waiting for trains.

's, start, slow, it, At first it's a slow start. However it starts ramping up with mystery. It is definitely worth getting.
is, story, amazing, This, This is an amazing story im very happy about it very recommended worth every penny!
's, game, amazing, It, This game truly immersed me in the story, I actually became worried about Taylor when I didn't hear from her. It's an amazing game with great story telling, and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I'm 100% addicted to this gave and it's sequels.
's, game, amazing, It, It's an amazing game that truly focuses on on the story
was, story, best, This, This was the best story for a mobile phone ever. The ending was suprising.
are, chance, only, you, Lifeline is different from any other game on the app store markets it immerses you in the story, makes you acountable for the choices that are made makes you believe that you are Taylor's only chance at survival, and I love it.
's, game, timed, it, I love how it's a timed game. The story is amazing and some times i found mysrlf checking my phone every few minutes because i needed to know what happened next.
is, buy, definite, this, If you enjoy choose your own adventure games, this is a definite buy. My one issue is Taylor. Just tell me what you see you sick bas. Quit making me ask whats happening. Fun story though. Onto the next Lifeline game for me!
was, person, real, it, This game was a recommendation by a friend. It's beautifully CYOA-TYPE story is more than I expected. It was compelling, even a bit surreal. The developer/writer really made it seem like it was a real person talking to you. Every conversation was fluid and your choices really were your choices. Whether Taylor lives or dies depends on you as a player, but more than that. Almost as if you were a friend across the eons looking out for him when he has no one.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game I've ever played, all because of the story.
is, concept, great, This, This is a great concept that was executed excellently! If you move story and you enjoy being the puppet master this is the game for you!
is, distraction, great, it, Like the old school choose your adventures books. I find it fun and it is a great minor distraction that I can play at my own pace.

'm, comma, cheap, I, I'm pretty cheap comma, so spending any money on an app is a big deal for me. At first, it's interesting and entertaining, but the story feels relatively short and gets too drawn out at the end.
is, game, great, This, This is really a great game i really loved the storyline.
's, game, unrealistic, it, This condescending character makes everything harder and blows up your phone like a jealous insecure girlfriend.. you give him advice and he still does exactly what you told him not to do.. frankly this game is a waste of time and stress on people with actual problems in life. It's not fun to have a what seems to be an uneducated man with no hope on the other end of your screen. He doesn't listen and it's always something (even if it's his doing) simply unrealistic game
's, gaps, long, it, Having an asynchronous visual novel run on the phone and message you via notifications is pretty neat. Wish it were longer, but then for the price it's also quite worth it. Update: Considering all the later entries, this one does it by far the best with it's comparatively long gaps between interaction and mostly autonomous character - it just feels more believable. Taylor is walking around doing things, we're only helping as needed.
am, while, short, I, "Are you okay? Please be okay. " I am only a short while into this and I am already concerned and care for Taylor. The above quotes have been heard by family members as I mutter them to myself. I keep picking up my phone just in case I missed a communication. This is a fantastic way of immersing someone in a game. If you want a chose your own adventure type game, except for the fact you are guiding someone, but one that has something different to add to the game type, this is it. Gotta go, communication...

is, game, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic game. Just utterly fantastic.
is, game, unique, This, This is such a unique and fun game. Definitely worth the money.
's, game, great, it, Clever involving story and design it's just a great game
's, game, gripping, It, It's definitely a gripping "game" especially if you go through it real time. Unfortunately I turned on the fast mode because I managed to get the protagonist killed on the first night. I didn't want to wait through the same night. Well, I ended up playing the whole story in fast mode and realized the playable minutes of this game is less than 2 hours. You can replay it if you want but it kinda loses it's appeal when you know what's gonna happen.
was, job, great, I, I was,skeptical at first, paying a dollar for a mobile game, but I haven't even finished the game yet and I'm already satisfied with it, definitely worth a $1 and its a great story so far, immersive  and its actually cool getting messages from Taylor with new questions and situationsüëç great job on this! I'd love to see more like it from the same creators
was, experience, wonderful, It, This game was outstanding the beginning was kinda slow but the way everything unfolded in the end gave me chills and kept me guessing if tailor was gonna make it off the moon or not. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to playing the next games
be, time, first, This, This would be the first time I enjoyed a choice game. It was hard not to get engrossed in the story, especially towards the end. The only drawbacks for me were the limited pathways and the short plotline. But the story was good nonetheless. WARNING: This is a choice game in which you wait for notifications after your choices (i.e., immersion factor).
'm, reader, avid, I, The storyline didn't grab me, but maybe that's because I'm an avid reader and simple plotlines like this seem a little dull. I'd prefer more options but oh well. What really annoyed me though was the constant stream of notifications I got at once (I'm playing on slow-paced!). I would love the option to disable notifications, time how often I get them or at least only put one saying that Taylor had responded and you needed to answer to him/her (I think it's a her). I hate the fact that the story seems to only give you one direction it wants you to go‚Äîif you go an incorrect path, he/she's constantly telling you if you're sure or that he/she thinks otherwise. I've tested this out several times on several different places and I always die when I stick with said path of him/her telling me to not choose that path. Then there is also the fact that all the responses are so similar! For example, I've read the words 'Are you okay?', 'What happened?', 'Are you sure...' more than a hundred times! It's irritating when you only have those two responses after his/her long chunks of speech. I didn't hate it, though I didn't like it either. I tried to make this  constructive
's, text, only, it, I love it. The experience this game offers is great. But be prepared to read a lot, since it's only text.
is, game, excellent, this, Concept,  execution, tone, this is an excellent game.
is, game, emotional, this, Taylor feels so real, you guys have done a fantastic job. For me this is an emotional game sometimes.... Because Taylor will face all the consequences of my advice. But really guys, this is to be one of those games i won't forget ever.
was, fun, much, That, That was so much fun, I've really enjoyed my time with Taylor over the last few days, uncovering the mysteries and making tough calls. Totally recommended.
is, game, usual, this, This is one of the best games I ever played on Android. That's probably because I don't usually enjoy computer games and because this isn't a usual computer game either. I would rather call it an interactive book where you make decisions on how the story should continue. Thus it's really not for fans of traditional games but might be interesting for people who don't usually play (like me) and especially for book lovers.
'm, man, sexy, I, God I'm a sexy man
is, download, best, it, I love it, it is the best download it now.
