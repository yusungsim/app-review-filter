credited, to, account, Bought 40,000 gems and they haven't been credited to my account. Please help!
get, past, it, Gets old quick. There's definitely a difficulty wall, and it didn't seem worth the grind to get past it. This game uses difficulty to add length, instead of being more interesting.
install, by, itself, The ads are just crazy they open playstore and install by itself without your consent.

legit, over, 60, Game is fun tbh but my issue is that the unlocking the game fully (getting all the heroes) is legit over 60$ for a phone games and it seems every kingdom Rush game is the same on Android where it's a cash grab to get the full experience idc that what they give you is good enough the game itself is not free so 10$+ for a hero is ridiculous

charging, for, hero, Fantastic game but charging up to $9 for a single hero is a bit much
purchased, from, series, KR series is one of the best tower defense mobile games I've ever played. This is the second game I purchased from KR series. Enjoying it so far, even tho some levels are quite a hassle and need a few attempts to complete it, but it's a nice experience overall.
using, for, mob, Probably the worst of the series. Levels are ridiculous even after having completed all other games... Too many invulnerable mobs that ignore or disable troops and towers... Its as if they forgot how to make levels challenging and fun without using god mode for every other mob...
are, in, level, Totally fun to play tower defense game . Sound effects , every characters's detailing and every thing in this game is totally brilliant and amazing . There are many new surprises in almost every level . Every defense system , every heros and character's has so many updates . I love to play this game and spend hours like minutes .

feels, like, sequel, My fav childhood game. I've been trying out all kingdom rush games and this one does not dissapoint. Gameplay is very similar to the first one, so it feels like a sequel. But it does have a few annoying touch glitches occassionally.
looking, for, what, PERFECT tower defence game; this is what you've been looking for. 10/10 for all of three of the Kingdom rush games, I highly recommend playing/supporting each of them
aged, In, day, In a day and age where apps are predatory and cheap throw aways, this game has aged like fine wine. Definitely worth it's cost

stuck, in, level, It was a fun game better then the original but when i nuked umbras insides it broke and they all disappeared but i was stuck in the level still did not complete
want, beyond, round, Bugs Beat Nazeru's Gate without taking any damage at all... still 2 stars. Not sure what else you want beyond a perfect round to get 3 stars. Nowhere in the app to report bug not contact support.
pay, to, unlock, Paid apps should not have high cost pay-to-win in-app purchases. Heroes that used to be unlockable through gameplay are now pay-to-unlock only. Very disappointing.
pay, for, it, I will always love kingdom rush games, but it is a shame you have to pay for it, I would bet alot more people would play it if it doesn't really cost anything. But in other words, great game and game franchise.
needs, re, balance, Just avoid. The game play needs serious re balance to keep the player motivated without breaking the bank. I tried but gave up and just uninstalled it. Developer, be greedy but not that quickly. Earn the players interest by letting them getting through with more rewards. Once hooked, they wont leave.

played, through, it, Have played through it a few times now, it's great for killing time
compared, to, others, Id say the hardest game of ironhide, you will completely enjoy first time playing it with how hard and challenging it is compared to others while also following the story, both artillery are op and templars are expensive and useless, assassins even more useful by just normally blocking not 3 overly tough templars in a game where enemies will flood you, and for sake nerf the deathcoils! That single enemy limits and remove heroes, reinforcents, barracks, and necromancers on darklight depths.

playing, with, play, One of the best tower defence games. I'm playing with Google play so it's all unlocked which is the best way to play.

has, to, it, Just like kingdom rush and has the same good old style to it
came, on, websites, Loved the first KR since it came out on websites in 2011. Play the app in 2015 and came back to it in the pandemic. Frontiers is my first money purchase and loving it so far

install, from, publisher, AWFULL! Another franchise RUINED by the pay to play.... The last game that I will EVER install from this publisher again.
come, with, game, I've played the free KR game & it's good, it would probably be the best free one, but still it has its issues in game play which became annoying. Frontiers is a big improvement on that game and the power ups are diverse and more intelligent. The hero's are still not great. The ones that come with the initial game are ok and will do. For more money, u unlock new hero's I don't see any major effect on the game play. They do different magic but they dont affect game play but cost you money. 4 / 5

talking, bout, eggs, This game …. Is actually so dumb it's funny ( I'm talking bout the random Easter eggs on each map)
paying, for, it, Love the game. Not a fan of paying for it or for better heroes, but that's my only complaint. Awesome game.
plagued, in, ads, Fun tower defence game that's not plagued in ads :)
play, on, anything, I dont play many strategy games but I love playing games on their hardest difficulty. However, this game feels impossible to play on anything but easy. I have tried different strategies and using various towers at choke points but still can't beat Nazarus gate. I will say that the game would be top tier if I could actually advance in the game, just feels like I hit a brick wall. I will say that this gamecould be top tier if it wasn't PTW and you could repeat levels to prepare for harder levels.

feels, like, experience, Just as good as Origins, and keeps the elements that makes the Kingdom Rush series so much fun, but also has a different enough theme and aesthetic so that it feels like a fresh experience.
help, at, which, Having a great time replaying the whole series, all for great prices at which to help support Ironhide Studios.
calling, for, reinforcements, Touch screen controls are unresponsive with command prompts on the screen. Very annoying when getting swarmed and need to upgrade while also calling for reinforcements. The stalled interruptions affect huge aspects of having good or not gameplay and is just annoying lol
playing, since, 2013, I've been playing the Kingdom Rush games ever since 2013. It's timeless, and I love these games so much. They are all amazing, but for some reason my favourite is Frontiers. Thank you Ironhide, for making these amazing games.
download, to, devices, The best tower game in the series from ironhide. Ironside games is the messi of Tower Defence games. However I have to pay again to download to a different devices so 4 * only.

playing, for, while, I've been playing this series for a while and this is one of my favourites of the series, the graohics are amazing, and the towers and heroes are well thought out, what would give this five stars would be extra levels based on the tribal arc. Thanks you for these amazin games, keep it up!

integrated, into, interface, The Kingdom Rush games are hands-down the best strategy-puzzle games available for mobile devices. With the ability to adjust the diffilcuty seamlessly integrated into the interface, casual gamers can enjoy the humor and many easter eggs, while those who want a devilishly difficult challenge can scale the diffilcuty up. Easily one of the best mobile games, in any genre.

made, On, level, On the 15th level they made it basically impossible to beat. The last boss destroys your towers. Then after you deplete its health. It breaks apart and your towers have to kill the little balls, before it reassembles. After it reassembles it destroys more towers. Unless you buy gems and keep spending to actually have towers. You'll lose, I had every tower fully upgraded and every spot taken. 2 different games, and this boss just keeps destroying them. Then when it's a quarter health it barely...
add, to, heroes, The developers has decided to add micro transactions to unlock heroes previously unlocked due to gameplay. No mention of this in patch notes, just randomly making heroes locked behind a paywall. Would rate 0 stars if I could. I have played each of their series and this latest action has made the game and the company behind it a strong no go for me from here on. Avoid their titles.

have, across, point, This one was a slight step back from the original. The character designs and towers are fun, and have new powers which make them fun to use, but they have haphazardly mixed enemies of different armor types across every choke point, severely limiting your strategy input because there is now no way of balancing your towers and keeping the resistances segregated, so now it feels largely up to rng whether or not your towers actually target who they are intended to and makes resistances arbitrary.

slow, in, games, Awesome, everything done top quality. And monetizing done perfect you can support devs but still does not slow down your progress like in some other games where 100dollars can get you 55 years of progress. I wish there was more games done like this.

move, past, level, The level Nazeru's gate is exceptionally hard on normal level itself.. unable to move past that level. Tried more than 10 time.. Please look into the same dev.. Finally got bored and quit..

buy, for, 60, I got a offer to buy two heroes for 60 and i bought it by using upi and i never got the heroes. I hate this.
changed, with, ai, I bought Boneheart and I don't exactly regret it, however he needs to be changed a little with the ai, half the time he doesn't attack a target that's right under him or near him, just sits there. He uses the golems and the lane clear moves just fine but in terms of targeting the enemy, lacking. I know it's an older game but I love it ☺️ just please fix Boneheart is all I ask

m, like, Rush, Oh, thank you, im like Kindom Rush.

play, for, fans, May be my favorite, but all of the Kingdom Rush games are amazing. Must play for fans of tower defense!
waiting, for, something, The game has a glitch, I have passed level 15 many times and even after I defeat the monster in that level Nothing happens I've sat there waiting for something to happen and at the end of the day I keep having to redo it I have screen shots to prove it. This game was great until this issue occurred now it's just a waist of time.

downloaded, via, pass, Great game! Totally recommend! It provides a fun experience while also being much different than the original game. I downloaded via Google play pass and it was very much worth it!
finished, within, day, Great game but very few level. All finished within 15 day and nothing to play.
replaying, for, years, I've enjoyed replaying this game for years. This is definitely my favourite of the kingdom rush series, and I do hope they keep making them. Can't recommend this game and the rest of the series enough to anyone who likes Tower defence games. Truly master classes in this field. Fun, challenging and a great sense of pop culture humor this game has it all!
rated, below, stars, Fun as usual, the entire series is great. This is the only one I rated below 5 stars due to how hard it is. Much harder than the reat of the series, even on casual
Had, on, enuf, Had it before on my old iPhone good enuf to get it twice.
playing, through, levels, This game is seriously perfect. I loved playing through the levels and venturing through the different areas. Kingdom Rush Frontiers stayed true to it's previous game and perfectly added on to the previous game's story. It's good in alot of aspects, although I can say it can be a bit too challenging sometimes, even with easy mode. But not always. Oh and it's not pay to win, I do lose alot, but eventually you will get the right defense and beat the level. Just don't give up. Loving the music!

spend, on, apps, Iron hide does such an amazing job with it's games! I usually never spend money on apps but theirs are always worth it!
winning, without, them, I loved this game all the say up to the last level. I can't figure out how to beat the final boss. I won't describe him, so as not to spoil, but he seems impossible to beat regardless of the towers I use. I do not know if that was intended to force the purchase of gems to get items, but it doesn't feel like you have a prayer of winning without them. Either way I have to take one star off. I like a challenge, but that boss feels excessive.
have, in, mode, The game is so hard that you dont have any fun even in easy mode.
passed, By, time, Very fun and addictive game. By the time I get done playing 3 hours have passed.

playing, for, years, This game is very fun, and it never gets old. Been playing this game and the other KR variants for years.
register, on, achievements, My achievements that I did offline can't seem to register on the Google play games achievements. Overall a great and challenging game. The strategic factor of this game is probably the best in all KR.
play, in, time, Good game 🎯 I play this game in free time so This game 🎮 make me feel great and more productive 🤟.
playing, on, kongregate, I remember playing this back on kongregate and its still just as fun as i remember. Forces you to use real strategy and is challenging. Heroes are varied and fun to use(even the payed ones). Overall definitely worth the 3$ you pay for it.

PAY, FOR, IT, LOVE THE GAME BOUGHT THE DRAGON HERO AND YOU TOOK IT AWAY FROM ME WHEN YOU MADE THE GAME TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT, I BOUGHT IT AND YOU TOOK WHAT I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR, WILL THIS BE RECTIFIED AS I DO NOT TAKE KINDLY TO BEING RIPPED OFF.
need, on, this, This game is so much better than the other iterations because of its music. I need more updates on this
think, on, feet, Fast paced. You really have to think on your feet.
play, on, phone, The best tower defence games and thanks for the cloud save I can play on any phone.
recommend, for, lovers, VERY fun and diverse tower defence game. Would recommend for tower defence lovers.
wait, for, World, Love this game! Can't wait for Junk World
pay, in, game, Paying just to have to pay again in game? Miss me with that.

come, with, game, If you liked the original, you'll like this one too! Pretty much the same so far, just different maps/looks, but I'm only 4 lvls in. Tower Defense/Strategy game, a few basic heros come with the game, extra heros cost $ each, but by no means is this a pay-to-play game (you won't need to buy them to win, they're just different from the ones that come with the game. They're usually a bit better, but that makes sense to me/is fair, since you pay for them).

did, on, all, I've always loved these games. The developers did a really good job on all of them
win, with, effort, Very enjoyable and engaging. Decently priced purchase items if you want to buy but with little effort you can still win. I bought few products and the the app as well. Thanks. Waiting for few more games from you.

countinues, in, way, Great sequel to the first game! This just countinues the kingdom rush franchise in the best way possible with a thrilling story and new fan favorites such as the Deep devils, Tons of easter eggs, and Epic bosses and Heros.
make, into, game, Still a great game even today. I like that they were able to make it into a mobile game. I wish more games from websites like Freewebarcade, armorgames and more would do the same.
find, in, situations, I enjoy this game but I find very frustrating in clutch situations the way the game screws you over. 1. When trying to play reinforcements at the bottom of the screen, you are blocked by a box telling you that you are placing reinforcements. 2. Often the game will glitch as you try to place clutch reinforcements, either re-centering the screen at the worst possible moment or becoming unresponsive just when you need it to placeI enjoy thi reinforcements when are trying to place reinforcements.

Often the game will glitch as you try to place clutch reinforcements, either re-centering the screen at the worst possible moment or becoming unresponsive just when you need it to placeI enjoy thi reinforcements when are trying to place reinforcements.

wait, for, updates, great game.. can't wait for any updates.

stop, For, those, For those who can't even beat the first 10ish levels, stop complaining and whining and learn how to strategize better! It's not that hard!
comes, after, hour, They reworked the game so that after an hour of play it comes to a stand still without spending money. Impossibly hard at the easiest level.

spent, on, DLC, I really liked the sequel to one of my favorite games and have also spent all my money on the DLC, overall very satisfied.
walk, by, them, Good game. Thing is though, the barracks soldiers suck at getting their target. Pretty easy for enemies to just walk by them because they're not put in their direct position.

devs, for, game, I played all the games and I still love replaying them over and over! Its just so fun! Thank you devs for such a wonderful strategy game. It improves on the first game formula and adds a lot of nuances that it feels familiar yet new!

play, on, difficulty, Very fun and challenging, this game give even an experience player a challenge even if they play on the easiest difficulty
come, from, background, Own all of Kingdom Rush games, come from a Starcraft background. There is no other game that still brings me so much joy and frustration at the same time, even after finishing everything I still come back. Hopefully there is a new sequel soon. Love this game

pay, for, game, Great game. Love the whole series however considering you pay for the game I'd like more of the hero's to be unlockable over paid
look, to, towers, Amazing mechanics, art, and simplicity. I look forward to the new towers, story, and funny easter eggs through out all the maps and games.

becomes, after, level, Game becomes way too difficult after level 28.
blazing, on, veteran, Maybe it's me but this entry is the most frustratingly difficult... Sometimes... But well, maybe it was because the Towers were quite balanced in this entry, since there's no easy Tesla Spam or Forest Keeper Spam. It didn't go easier even when I already played the flash... Anyway thr Desert and Sea levels are that frustrating, the desert because it practically forces you to play normal first rather than guns blazing on veteran to get thoze upgrades, while the Sea Levels just frickin frustrating
reminds, of, childhood, Simple game, reminds me of my childhood, back when the internet was still slow as hell.
coming, to, it, Vet fun game loved it years ago coming ba k to it it's just as good very good game
buy, from, Ironhide, Please do something about the champions. I bought the game and then you want me to pay $45 to unlock all the champions? I thought you where better then this Ironhide... Obviously I was wrong. This low rating hurts me since I've been a fan of your games for so long, but I will not support any company like Electronic Arts (EA). What's next Ironhide? Loot-Boxes to unlock everything? Ads after and before every round? I will no longer buy anything from Ironhide till you do better. Don't be EA...
Looking, for, game, Looking for a game that hasn't been ruined? Here you go :-)
put, into, game, I've put a lot of hours into this game. It does get difficult on the harder difficulties, but it is definitely beatable without having to make in app purchases. If you are having trouble beating a level, watch some strategy guides on YouTube.

play, with, father, It's a good game, used to play it with my father when in was 10 years Old. It's a shame thing they removed the Adobe flash player so now u have to pay for it, but im still glad it's on the market - 5 stars, totally deserved

Compared, to, one, Compared to the second one this game is better the defense has got a Fighting Chance at least you made them meaner dont know what happened to you guys but the scenod you must of had i don't wont to make the ladies mad but thay are meaner than the defense on the second one

pay, for, each, As with their other games... You buy the game, just to find that you have 4 out of 16 characters unlocked. To unlock the full game, pay ~5 bucks for each of the 12 locked characters... "But the game is perfectly playable with just those 4!" No, devs... That's not the point and you know it. Not cool.
playing, for, years, Been playing for quite a years since 2012,Iron hide never disappoint me, plus you could buy a hero for only $0.99, that's a great price.

came, across, this, Haven't even bought a game before but I came across this but I just finished kingdom rush and came across this and had to play the full version. Even the start of this game is different yet probably better. Love it

playing, since, time, Very nicely made. I enjoy playing it since quite a long time and it is always a fun to play it again.
looking, at, games, This game has truly changed my way of looking at games, it was so submersive, and the maps were so realistic and full with easter eggs that I just can't let go of this game. You have earnt all my respect, Ironhide for creating this.

level, during, play, I've only played a few levels so far, but they've been great. I appreciate the ability to upgrade towers between levels as well as level them up during play. Seems like a great TD.

played, in, series, Best castle defence games out there. Whole series is brilliant- funny, challenging, well thought out. I've played these and others in the series to completion, would love to see a new game from these developers!

offers, to, problem, I really have to poop and this game offers ZERO solutions to my problem.
prepared, for, boss, I had a good time in fact it was better than I thought, it was worth my money. I watched a lot of ads for gems then prepared for a boss and when it was boss time it glitched and there were no enemies for minutes and so all of that ad watching went to waste.
detect, in, play, the achievement i not detect in goggle play but in game it's detect
struggling, on, mode, Good for now . Even on easy mode , still struggling to take 3 starts lmao
make, in, minute, One of the worst tower defense games ever maps seem like they were make in minute and literally put a dude that one hits every troop at the end of a level just because why not.

debited, from, account, Very bad game I buy 2 hero's my money is debited from my account but I don't get any hero return my money😔
win, without, diamonds, Not as fun as original. No special characters and game is unreasonably hard. Can't win without diamonds to buy gold. Would not buy again if given opportunity.
purchased, from, game, Hello, I have purchased a hero from the game. Amount got deducted but still I'm unable to select the hero in the game. Even the Restore button is greyed out. Kindly help.

bought, for, offer, I bought 2 heroes for an offer Rs70 as special offer and my money has been deducted but I didn't receive those 2 heroes
put, into, style, Of all the games on the app store that are so contrived and stale, with obviously no passion or thought put into the art style or playability. And their heavy focus on getting you to buy things to progress, Iron Hide, the creator of kingdom rush, brings a breath of fresh air to mobile gaming. I've played this game and its other sibling games for years and they are some of the best mobile games out there. Truly a 5 star game.

is, besides, game, Love this game only thing I find is there isn't much to the skill trees besides that great game to pass time
get, in, time, Kindom rush frontiers is really fun and a nice stratigy game, same with all the other kingdom rushes however frontiers gives me a good challange and i like it but i dont like the one time offers i would like them to last a day or so so i might get the ones that i want, cus today i found a one time offer for the heros ashbite, and boneheart for 4.99 but i couldn't get it in time, also i don't usually pay for games but this one is worth the money.

control, with, difficulty, Easy to learn and control with enough difficulty to keep it interesting
come, with, game, Great game with amazing world building. Good engaging art and animations with well though out designs for each character and tower. Some heroes are costly but the free ones that come with the game already have impeccable skills and incredible mechanics. A great game to play when u have time to burn. Highly recommend!
beat, on, PC, I beat this game on PC and am loving the app version. It's come a long ways since it came out on ArmorGames.

paid, for, game, Played the free version and was hooked. I have not paid for a game on the play store for a long time but this one deserves it. It is quite rare for a video game sequel to actually improve upon the existing mechanics without dramatically up ending the entire game, but Frontiers does it very well. I did end up paying for a hero but that was only because it looked cool. The hero's being expensive is the only problem for this game and I hope they release a multi hero discount pack like previously.

challenging, at, levels, Good tower defense game, easy to get into, challenging at later levels
put, in, game, I installed Kingdom Rush because it was free and offline. And I was definitely looking forward to continuing to play a sequel. So I paid for Kingdom Rush Frontiers. I am satisfied. I congratulate you, I love the graphics of the game, I love the way you put things in the game that hint at pop culture. This game deserves 5 stars. I am happy, thank you.

bought, in, phone, This is one of my best favorite tower defense game so far and I've been playing this fir years and now i just bought it in my phone,i can finally have fun with it carrying all my memories,this game is indeed the best although the other heroes need purchase but it's worth the payment,the challenge is what i was interested in,i recommended buying these
get, per, kill, This game is ridiculously unbalanced. It's cool there is no pay to play, can play offline. But, the game itself is ridiculously unbalanced, as far as how much coin you get per kill, the sheer amount of enemies per wave (even on the easiest setting) the upgrading system. The upgrading system is based on stars, 3 stars if you did well, 2 and 1 stars if not, you can get 5 stars per level, problem is you hit level 6 and hit a literal wall with the enemy type and number and slow upgrading.

give, on, mode, I can't give this a good rating.even on easy mode I can't beat the sixth level
play, at, time, It's a lot of fun, but it's kind of annoying that I can't play music at the same time, 5 stars if changed
Love, in, series, Amazing. Love it❤️. Best in the series in my opinion.
hooked, on, them, I've been playing this saga of games for 8 hrs still come back and play. The characters the story its all so well done. Now I've got my students hooked on them lol Didn't think much of the last one tho pretty crappie actually compared to the rest

pay, for, app, If you like Kingdom Rush, then here's more of it. However, although you pay for the app, there are still in-app purchases. If you're good enough at the game you can beat almost all of the levels, however, the final level in the story is nearly impossible without at least one IAP. Considering that I paid for the game already, I'd hoped that it would be able to be completed without locking the "final" level behind a secret pay wall. Very disappointed.

played, for, hours, I wasnt expecting this game to be so good! Ive played it for hours on end! Its amazing!
playing, on, difficulty, Kingdom rush is one of the best tower defense games I have come across. I love the challenge of playing on veteran difficulty and trying to figure out a strategy to beat the tough levels but beginners could have fun too on easier game modes. I love how you get to choose which upgrade path to choose for each tower, based on preference of what suits the level.

paced, with, relief, A long time ago when I was but a weed boy, this was my favorite game on armorgames. It has yet to fail me. Highly recommend. Fast paced tower defense with good comedic relief thrown in, sure to keep you entertained for awhile. Can't complain.

played, on, phone, The most fun game I've ever played on my phone. As the others say, no adds, lots of high quality content and challenging without needing premium purchases. I just finished it after many hours of fun and I'm sad it's over!

paying, for, it, This is a peace of shift app. Even after paying for it, it gets so hard that after the 4 or 5 maps you have to pay for special items wich cost gems. Gems are so hard to get you can never have enough unless you buy them wich make this game pay to play which they clam not to be. Fork you Ironhide Games. Uninstaled in less than a day and demanding my money back. You may have mad 2 bucks off me but you won't get a cent more and others will be warned.

Looking, for, game, Entertaining, I hope you'd make a modern warzone defense or world war 2 defense, and still same kind of graphic art and animation with a nice story line. Looking forward for your game Ironhide. Thumbs up!
advertised, as, game, Pay to win. I purchased this game because it was advertised as an offline game on Google play store. Turns out it's just another pay to win game and you will need to fork out LOTS! To put it in perspective, a big Mac in South Africa costs R38, a vault of gems in this game costs 860 and it may not even be enough. I understand the concept of pay to win, but you will be paying A LOT to win! It's trickery from both the game company and Google play. At least advertise what the game really cost.

built, with, concepts, it's a neat idea to visit the beginning of this fun series built up with various tower defense concepts.
cuts, after, advert, It would have been 4 stars because it is a good game but recently it just won't load it just cuts out after the enitial Ironhide advert! It wouldn't have bothered me if it was a free game but it wasn't.
expensive, for, units, Good game, to expensive for high levelled units
gets, to, hard, This game is awesome! It's super fun to play, its challenging, theres a lot of levels but sometimes the game gets to hard
planning, with, diacounts, When will you have a sale again? I'm planning to buy every heroes but with diacounts of course
relaxing, at, time, This is -- hands down -- the greatest phone game out there. It is both intense and relaxing at the same time, has 0 ads, and doesn't constantly ask you for money. I have loved this series since I first played it on the computer when I was 14, and ten years later I am still playing it on my phone. I have never met anyone who doesn't like this game after trying it for just 5 minutes. I would give this game 10 stars if I could.

spawn, with, health, Oh my holy lord... My only problem is the spawners. (Sand wraith)(blood trickster) enemies that spawn enemies with crazy health and damage, the spawners themselves have crazy health and ranged damage. They make this game so infuriating to play. I have beat every single other game on veteran without the purchased items. The blood trickster is the main problem. The axe thrower silence targets the first enemy instead of spellcasters, so the tricksters never get silenced. Otherwise great but annoyin

paying, for, items, All of these games from this company are nearly the same, the first 2-4 stages are easy but then the difficulty increases way higher then the player can handle without paying for items. I can't even get past stage 5 without paying for anything even after I tried different strats, lowered from normal to easy (which barely did anything), and tried different upgrades. This game is not what I expected from a game I had to pay for, it feels like they just slapped a price tag on a F2P game.

loved, for, years, I've loved this game for years! Best fantasy tower defense on the planet, hands down!
locked, without, pass, I played the free Kingdom rush and decided to try this. It is a great game; interesting towers and you now need multiple types to win. If without the Google play pass, certain heroes are locked...
open, on, emulator, I purchased it, but I cannot open it on my bluestacks emulator, and Im using my account that already purchased it. How do I fix it?
lost, with, login, Loved this game but there's no 'restore purchases' button anymore so I lost all my heroes even with my login
sync, with, account, Achievements don't sync with google play account
PAY, TO, WIN, PAY TO WIN! Impossible game, I love tower defense games but I'm on the5th level and not on hard and I've played it 20 times with different combinations, I didn't think after I paid for the game that it would be pay to win.

spamming, to, point, Absolute pay to win trash game. They made dusk chateau the hardest level in the game by spamming too many high level enemies to the point where you need to buy powerups which you can buy with real money.The devs honestly need to get off their asses and tell everyone the truth that this game is pay to win trash. The devs never play tested all the levels to see if they can be beat without powerups because they know you can't. Ironhide studios is trash.

paid, for, game, Very bad and unrealistically hard to pass. Even if I paid for the game I am still offered to buy to pass levels. Not recommend

advance, through, stages, Very fun yet difficult as you advance through the stages. I'm pretty picky about my games and this one surprised me, simple but not easy and yet fun.
put, as, games, Not as put together as their other TD games, but still solid, well programmed, and fun.
paying, on, mode, Very nice, though the heroes are a little expensive. You don't need them to play though, one of the best heroes in the game is free. No P2W, whole game can definitely be completed without paying (even on hard mode if you try different setups a few times). Would recommend for everyone, KR games are the best TDs out there! Can't wait for the next one/new updates.

say, on, it, I've played a few levels so far it's the same as the original, however the tutorial is shorter and you can upgrade the heroes. It's just good no more can I say on it.
compared, to, game, Brilliant, but not enough additions compared to the free game.
saves, in, cloud, Finally, you made it! Thanks for hearing our needs, saves game in the cloud. I apologize you, because of my lost save game before. Five stars!

spend, in, money, This game is amazing. You don't need to spend any in game money to finish the game. It is so challenging that I do some missions 30 to 40 times before completing it with 3 stars. I've completed the original and now I'm moving on as they've been released. Really highly recommended.

lose, in, game, it's a good game but when i start buying new hero it started also to lose control in the game i wasted 10 bucks
going, until, lvl, This was going to get 5 stars, until lvl 15. The boss destroys all your towers and tbete is no way to keep up the rebuild. Bad design...cmon. Was great until then.
brings, from, stars, Only thing that brings this down from 5 stars is that despite the game being paid for you still need to pay to unlock most hero units. I'd rather have a higher price and everything unlocked.
get, without, PTW, I consider myself a good TD player. I managed to get 3 stars without PTW until I reached the sunken cidatel. What the fork were you guys thinking? It's freaking hard and there's no way you can make it without any purchase, even for easy level of difficulty.

deducted, from, account, I paid the money for the hero blazing breath. However, it is still not available to me. The money has been deducted from my account though.
pay, for, it, pay to play even though you have to pay for it
play, for, mins, Game is super fun! You can play for 10 mins or 2 hours and it's still fun. Worth the money for sure! Adds all kinds of new stuff! With keeping that same style as the first. New heroes upgrades items levels for just 2 bucks!

waiting, for, stuff, Lots of fun, easy to just play a level while waiting for other stuff or, and this is important, sitting on the toilet. Pretty solid gamarooni!

made, in, game, I've always loved this series. It makes the Google Play Pass worth the yearly fee. Lots of tower defense strategy, with plenty of replayability. I like the little changes they made in each game, too. Just enough to feel like you're playing a new game.
play, for, hours, Its the est stress relier ive found i play for hours and get lost in the game

charge, for, heroes, Why this game still charge for heroes?
compare, to, game, Charmful and really funny td game. Doesn't compare to your average mobile game, mocks you for spending ingame currency. Play it without credit card.

paid, for, purchase, I had paid 120rs for purchase of hero payment was made but hero is not unlocked
get, past, level, Too difficult to play-if you can't get past the 2nd or 3rd level on casual(THE EASIEST LEVEL IN THE OPTIONS MENU...) , then it defeats the purpose. I can't learn how to play if I'm constantly dying. The details are so small that tapping usually fires outside where intended. Leveling up is too difficult. Not enough boost per level up keeps the enemies strong and the heroes weak. It has potential, but not as is. Added 1 star for Play Pass availability - so without would have gotten 0 stars.
became, in, levels, The first one struck a good balance between difficulty and fun. It became a little much in the higher levels without making purchases but they have to make their money somewhere. I purchased this one and the difficulty was a little much right off the bat.
