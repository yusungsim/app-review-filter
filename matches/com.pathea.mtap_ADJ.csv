game, favorite, I just bought this game and it crashes constantly. It's frustrating because this is my favorite game on Xbox. Love how the didn't leave out any of the things that are on the console game, as most mobile versions usually do. But jeeze it's glitchy. I even deleted a bunch of stuff off my phone in case that was part of the problem. It wasnt. Super frustrating that it constantly freezes and kicks me off, usually right before I go to bed to save. Don't waste money on this till they fix this issue

game, best, Dear Developer, This is the best roleplay game ever for me because i've never spent my money for any games even once before. This game is very worth to buy and so addictive. We didn't compete with anyone (Except Higgins in game haha) that's why it's very relaxing, and healing too. I hope in future you can give Indonesian subtitle and dubbing too, because so many Indonesian fans play this game.. And I hope you can give us more update to make us more addicted with this game. Regards 😊

take, refreshing, The game is a refreshing take on "farm" sim rpg. The grinding on this game is almost the exact opposite on other farm sim, since you'll take most of your time mining instead of farming. Pro: 1. Combat are fairly easy 2. You can access every storage 3. There is voice acting and a lot of npc to befriend with Cons: 1. The game is fairly heavy, there are some area that will make your frame drops 2. You will lose your time playing this game (wait...its actually a good thing) Very worth it. 5/5

game, Great, Great game, but no Android/MFi controller support. Kishi does not work. This type of controller support would greatly enhance the gaming experience.
day, second, Game keeps crashing when the second day of the snowball fight concludes. I wanted to give this a decent rating but this bug needs fixing.

specs, recommended, Game crashes almost every 5-10 minutes. I have an android 8 phone... I know it's not within the recommended specs, but please create a solution where it doesn't crash so frequently. It's hard to do anything when the game crashes so ofter. I also have to manually save the game, so if I forget to save every 10 minutes or so, I'll have to redo a day to two ingame.
People, Indonesian, Add Indonesian Language and 5 stars from all Indonesian People! Still no update?
player, single, Very lovely open world single player game. I love how there is always something to do every day. Totally addicted. Don't mind the negative comments. Worth buying.

update, last, As of the last update, we can finally get the DLC outfits. However, instead of being sold in a pack, each individual outfit is a whooping $1 each ($26 total!!!) Outrageous to have to buy them separately, and while I could understand a price tag of maybe $8 for the outfits in total, this brings the DLC total over the cost of the main game. Ridiculous in the least, and so much more than the steam version. This move is beyond me, but I won't put a penny into them until the pricing is changed

support, full, It's great but please add full gamepad support
games, mobile, The game is amazing. It's a console game for mobile and you don't see mobile games like this ever. But the game has a lot of bugs.
game, lovely, It seems like a lovely game and could become the "new" Stardew valley. But.. I played a while and I didn't like the controller on the screen so I bought a Razor Kichi controller. But I tried the game with the controller and it doesn't seems to work with this controller. Is there any chance you are gonna support controllers in the future? Otherwise it's almost unplayable on mobile.

data, local, Can not get game to recognise local save data so that it can then be uploaded to cloud save
game, Uninstalled, Uninstalled game due to glitch of not being able to interact with Arlo to complete task... It did not reinstall with game data.

game, great, Just started playing, really fun, voices sound a bit funny but great game
game, Best, Best game.
buildings, other, The game is great overall, one problem I encounter is the A&G construction interface. I can't move the place of construction of the barn and other buildings
games, other, It is really goood! Really worth it for the price considering that I paid more on other games that has recharge.
places, other, Please add a multiplayer option ,so that we can play it with our friends in other places
game, amazing, An amazing game, i hope you can add controller support in the future update

setting, apocalyptic, I really enjoy playing this, it's basically a life sim with a post apocalyptic and dystopian setting. Many lovable characters with interesting stories. It's awesome.

transactions, micro, Love this game! Totally worth the money. It's addictive and so much fun. There is always story progression and things to do plus no in app ads or micro transactions. Highly recommend.
phone, better, I wish it ran better but I'm poor and can't afford a better phone or a good enough pc so I'm still thankful I can even play this, despite all the crashes. I just save often. It's a very fun game.

complaint, only, My only complaint is there's no controller support. At least for my kishi controller. It's really hard playing a game like this with screen controls for an extended period. I have pretty large hands. My hands started cramping after 20 minutes. I just bought it for my switch lite on the nintendo site. That should solve the problem.

game, actual, Really loved the actual game, but randomly after a month of playing, my entire progress is gone. No way to retrieve. The game acts like I've never played it before. So extremely sad and upset because I really enjoyed playing!

game, great, Hesitant at first to purchase the game but no regrets doing so since it's a great game and a good break from all those MMORPGs I've played, tho my major issue now is I can't enter the Abandoned Ruins #2 despite completing the "A bridge to amber island" quest already. Edit: it's supposed to be 5★ already a few weeks back but since I got busy at work and I've already deleted my "bugged" save so I have to start all over again but it's good to see the developer is very active in responding.

games, more, Bought this game on steam then on moblie. Let me say. STILL AN AWESOME GAME! I see a lot of changes and some quest are missing for moblie oh well. BUY THE GAME! ITS WORTH IT! I love it! WISH Dev will make more games.
contents, better, Very good. Got that Harvest Moon feelings. But with better contents ofcourse. Hopefully the dev will add more contents soon. Really love this game.

control, moving, Honestly this is just amazing. The graphic, the storyline, the characters, the gameplay n the music. Then why don't I give it a 5 stars ? 1)the moving control can be really annoying especially in ruins. I lost counts at how many times I accidentaly running instead of just moving forward. 2)The voice acting. Some sound good like Arlo n Emily but many just sound awkward n stiff 3) I wish there would be a defense option in the combat system (maybe they implement it but I just haven't progress far)

game, favorite, hands down my favorite game to play on mobile the features added from this to consel are enough to keep me hooked for years to come thanks guys
bar, high, I know this was on Xbox first. But it still sets a high bar for what mobile games could be. Comprehensive game mechanics that support the experience as a whole, no advertisements, no microtransactions. Without cheap gimmicks, u have to rely on the playing experience alone to sell the game. And I think it this game does just fine in that regard. Even if Life Sims like these aren't ur cup of tea, mobile gamers can still appreciate the straightforward gameplay design with no flash. Devs, take note.

quest, main, I can't turn in commissions. I completed 2 commissions and I practically hunted down the people to turn in the commissions to them, but there is no way to turn them in even after talking to them. I have the items in my inventory and idk how to get them to the person because it gives no option to give it to them. EDIT: this was happening because I still had a main quest to complete. Sorry about that
glitch, minor, This game is great.🤘 When i first see the video clip, i gonna buy this. I notice a minor glitch. ▪︎When fishing and you get 2 fish at once. You get the 1 fish, but the second fish just swimming around.

game, Great, Great game with tons of features, fun activities, interesting stories, and long play time hours. Because this is an offline game, we can play with our own pace, yeay! In default, we are focusing to become a great builder and run our workshop, but it doesn't limit you to focus on other things like become a friends, harvesting, fishing, ruin diving, and many more. This is one of the best game in Android, the price is so cheap compared to what you can get. Thanks developers and publisher!

game, first, I promised myself to never buy games as much as possible and this is the first game that I have purchased my whole life. I can't get enough of this. I love it so much. The only downside of this game are the occassional bugs like the automatic wayfinding sometimes doesn't work especially when riding a mount. Also, the gift giving button took too long to respond. Otherwise, game is perfect.

The only downside of this game are the occassional bugs like the automatic wayfinding sometimes doesn't work especially when riding a mount. Also, the gift giving button took too long to respond. Otherwise, game is perfect.

port, Decent, Decent port, interesting enough to keep you hooked for 10-20 hours, but you hardly will have any interest in keeping playing after that time mark. Let's not even talk about finishing the game. After a while that game just become a resource management simulator, where you got wait ridiculously long times for each item to craft, just to make the game artificially longer.

game, Good, Good game mostly like the computer game just needs support for controllers
games, mobile, Haven't loved any mobile games more! I started without much expectatiom, and blinked, then, miraculously, more than 80 hours spent on the game! I do not think I am at the half of the game yet because I just play very leisurely. Chopping woods, chatting up specific npcs, dating two, breaking up with one and marrying the other. I feel really attached to the game and frantically am trying to find a replacement for the future. Urgh. Hard.

day, new, I love the game but can u please fix this one bug pls. It was fine before but now I cant go to the ruins anymore because the it keeps getting stuck at the loading screen. I tried to start a new day and everything still the same.
games, best, I don't know how to describe this, but this is one of the best games I've ever played. You get hooked for hours once you start playing. Also it doesn't overheart my phone, and there are endless things to do there with no money grabbing at all

amount, certain, I get bored easily after consistently playing a game for a certain amount of time. This game really keeps up to its standards. It never fails to keep me intrigued! I'm obsessed with its storyline and the probability of exploring more than just the town. This game is the best rpg simulation I have ever played. Worth every penny!

pictures, many, I would give this 5 stars but I have found 2 glitches. 1-I have milk but Ack won't take it. He just keeps saying he misses his girl.... 2-I have taken many pictures of the outside if Portia Times and it won't finish my quest. It won't acknowledge that I took the pic. This is keeping me from progressing the main quests. 🤬

time, first, the first time i picked up a chicken and ran across the farm for the other ducks and chicks to follow me so everyone can beat me the f up was hilarious... but still too laggy for my phone a good samsung version, a galaxy a21s, but i do can play it on the tablet... when ever this game feels more smooth for my android mobilephone device then you will be getting 5 stars but for now the game is awesome just this lag i be getting on my phone

🔥, kinda, Okay this game is actually kinda 🔥! One of the most in depth mobile games I've ever played, and it doesn't do any money grabbing. Perfect thing to do on a plane ride. I have a suggestion for the devs. The inventory system is incredibly annoying: Don't require that an item is in the backpack in order to complete quests, commissions, selling at shops, gifting, etc. And don't require that an item is in the quick bar to cook with it. Just show whatever cooking items you own. Would be much better!

promise, much, This game has so much promise, but it lags badly on my Samsung tablet in just a short time even with game boosting. I am afraid I got tired of this problem and ended up Uninstaller. Perhaps I wi.l try this game again in the future.

impression, first, I've just started playing this but my first impression of the game is impressive. I play on a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and so far the game runs smooth. Not being a mobile gamer I was skeptical if I would like the game controls compared to a game controller, and again, I'm highly impressed how easy the controls are. I will update my review once I have played more extensively.

times, several, I tried to load up the game several times, causing it to crash almost every time. When it was finally open, I was greeted by the most horrifying playable character I've ever seen. I was shocked, even the Wild Thornberries are ugly in a charming way. The game, graphically speaking, just feels unfinished. Most terrain is just a flat, textureless plane. I only played for a few minutes before chickening out. The voice acting is charming though, and rather different from most games, which I liked.

price, half, No, I stole my dad credit carrier prepaid just to buy this, I want a refund ! My dad knew but he just ignore it due to his credit has been deducted stealthily. Ah, better getting this game at a half price. Tbh, I want support you just bcs I managed to mod this game meshes + it is in the phone now(Regarding to mod, don't worry I will not share anything public if it breaks the T&C). Fyi, most prepaid credit(include his) can't withdraw into the bank so I made up to buy this game :') Sad story end.

bug, gamebreaking, Game itself is good, but there's a gamebreaking bug. I was getting out of the house and suddenly the game is reverted like day 1 with all the items intact. So i closed the game and the save file cant be opened. Honestly this is a terrible bug it makes you lose all your progress. It happens for the second time

setting, lowest, I love the game but it's practically impossible to get past a day. The game constantly crashes even though my system is up to date and my ram is more than ok. It's on the lowest setting possible and literally sucks at running.

game, refreshing, It's a refreshing simulation game.
head, sewing, I ended up loosing the sewing head now i can't complete a quest.
time, much, I'm sad that I can't seem to launch the game past the character set up. It crashes after I create my character. Also it's very difficult to change the character name because I can't get the keyboard to pop up. Only after fiddling with it for way longer than I care to admit was I able to get the keyboard to appear. Way too much time and effort to create a character only to have it crash and disappear.
game, Great, Great game
port, mobile, I have loved this game for 2 years now and I'm so glad it's on mobile! The mobile port is very well done and the developers fix bugs quite fast. My Time at Portia is a wholesome game where you can live your life as a builder, befriend townspeople, explore the vast open world, and do quests that enhance gameplay and progress the story of the game. I'd say it's well worth my money. Definitely my favorite game.

version, mobile, I am super glad I downloaded this mobile version. I was at first concerned that the controls would be noticably bad compared to the other platforms, but the controls are actually managable. Every so often I do see flickering when I move, but it's not bad enough to make me stop playing. That's really my only reason for not giving a 5th star.

end, low, this game is phenomal!!!!! i cant let my phone down playing this game and i already played 210+ hours!! but sadly im using a low end device thats why even in the lowest settings seems laggy. devs could you please adjust the graphics, i suggest in-game option for more lower graphics for low-end devices so that we can play less laggy. pls! i really like this game so much. hope you will take note my suggestion PS: Please make also a mobile platform of MY TIME AT SANDROCK that can play also offline.

engine, advanced, One time I accidentally gave Scraps(the dog) an advanced engine instead of the dog food I was trying to feed him. Got +1 friendship with him for it still, and I gotta assume because it immediately vanished that he ate it, which is pretty hardcore.

experience, great, So I've always wanted to play this game for PC. To find out suddenly not only is it mobile now but also $7.99? I jumped at the chance and am now having a great gaming experience. With all the content I'm discovering I can't foresee running out of things to do in the game anytime soon.
space, extra, Every time I assemble the stone furnace and retrieve it, it does not go to my inventory. I make sure to have lots of extra space in my inventory but still no luck. Restarted game, restarted phone, doesn't work. Can't advance at all since this is a key build for the first few quests. Super disappointed - a game you pay for should actually work.

lots, true, Its like a dream come true - lots of freedom and a HUGE amount of content, not to mention the devs pays attention to it (even its offline) and care to fix bugs. Definitely a must-try if you like harvest moon-style game!

fun, much, This game is so much fun. Me and my family enjoy playing this. It is challenging but not to much. Also I love how you can spare and play rock, paper,sicors.
game, best, i play almost +120 hours, this is the best game 🤩
day, full, Keeps crashing/freezing . I'm on year 4 and since I got the factory I can't even do a full day. The game doesn't save so I am sick of repeating things and then losing them again. i have to go to sleep after a few game hours have passed if I want to make sure it saves. Its a shame because i have loved playing it so far 😢

game, Great, Great game. But the game has a glitch with Dr.Xu dialogue doesn't match with sound, hope Dev. Fix this issues 😉
experience, Better, Better experience playing this on my phone than my Nintendo DS! I love this game and any glitches since I began playing have been quickly resolved.
game, whole, Ok, now that I've finished the whole game I can give final review: Overall a decent game of this genre, however the game feels unpolished to me, doesn't offer much replay value. Not enough decorative items for house and yard, no different play style, restarting to get some of the romance exclusive items isn't worth the time, once the main mission concluded nowhere to spend all the gol. I wish for things to do post game. P.S. Why the fish tanks don't show number of fish inside? Add that please.

game, LONG, My time is a LONG game there will easily be over 100 hours play time so the price is a steal. I played it on PC but have been commuting and needed to pass time. I am impressed it is the full game. Great game for anyone into open world like Stardew Valley. I didn't like the many of the default settings. I recommend turning down the passage of time in the options menu for the cellphone since it is a multi tasking device. I gave it 5 because I am happy it is on the phone.

state, great, Edit 2: The game is in a great state now compared to the initial launch. Most glitches are fixed and a lot more graphics options are added. Overall this is a great port, a must buy for all those who love farming simulation games (although this is more of a workshop simulation, lol)

way, easier, So far I love this. I do wish it was a bit more like stardew valley. It's a bit hard to run around and the point of view if difficult to keep up with. Also I wish you could change your face after you start. I think eventually you guys will add a easier way to run And bigger font!

action, many, Remind me of Rune Factory and Harvest Moon, but BETTER. So many interact action with NPC. Refreshing mining game play and so much mini games. Easy to play. Many save slot and can be uploaded to cloud data. The map are so wide. Interesting storyline. I really recommended this game, it's worth to play

woman, happiest, I loved this game on console and on PC. And just learning that they added this game on mobile as well made me the happiest woman ever! I love games like this. I never cease to be entertained by this game and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a challenging time consuming game like My Time at Portia.

time, first, Oh boi! This game is so good! I played harvest moon before but this game is really different! For the first time i buy a game without a second thought after released xD and I'm glad that I'm buy it! No talk more 5* for sure! REALLY WORTH TO DOWNLOAD!!!

game, enjoyable, Very enjoyable and chill game, It would be nicer if i could rotate my character while mining with the right joystick or be able to just tap on furnace to open instead having to accurately rotate my character to be straight to be able to open stuff.

update, latest, The latest update allows me to modify my settings based on my phone capability. I could now run the 60 fps with balanced setting well. I kinda get a problem with getting overheating easily as well as the game consumes my battery quickly. But the game is still fine.

game, Amazing, Amazing game love it so addicted. Seriously need to make it easier to get carbon fibre tho can't find it anywhere which is making me want to give up the game as it's what I need to go any further
battle, last, I really love this game, even i never play on PC. But, that was some bug when you married end of winter season, exactly when you are complete the last battle, Gale will stuck inside the round table and doesn't speech to open deepest ruin, or maybe deepest ruin are not included in mobile version ? I'll make it 5 after answered or fixed

Devices, mobile, without friends, this game is going Boring for the multiplayers Gamers 😔😪 my time at Sandrock isn't available in mobile Devices 😑
game, fun, It's a fun game
device, mediocore, Please make a quicksave or autosave feature on this game. I'm playing on a 32 rom 3 ram vivo y11 which makes it a mediocore device. The game always crashes and take me to the starting point of the day where i crashed and i can't blame the app if my phone can't keep up to the game. I cleaned my phone from games that i really love just to play this game but it's still not enough. Please consider my suggestion for the sake of low specs cp users like me. TY for this game and i hope you'll see this.

thing, only, Loved playing this on PC, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it on mobile. The only thing I can think of that would make it just that much better is having the ability to use a gaming controller with it, my hand was starting to cramp up the other night due to how long I had been holding my phone in an awkward position for so long while playing. Otherwise it's exactly like the PC version and I'm super happy with it.

game, .awesome, amazing. .one suggestion if developer can make customized HUD because sometime misclick attack and jump button. .awesome game
screen, mobile, Essentially perfect, although I would dearly love controller support. That said the mobile screen controls are pretty good, although finding the pickup button during the airship drop sequence made it hard to collect gifts before other characters grabbed them. You get a lot of game for your money too. If you're a fan of stuff like Stardew Valley this is a no-brainer. Also looks *great* and keeps up a solid 30fps mostly (on Pixel 4)

save, older, The bug regarding with Petra can't be spoken has been fixed. Just have to reload my older save. Means I have to redo my whole day. But it's ok cause now I can continue my missions. I just have a concern regarding the system messages. It shows and vanish so fast that I have no time to read it and its also so small. Specially if its an event reminder like calendar event or playdate reminder. Please make the fonts bigger and shows longer.

game, next, I love this kind of game so much. Looking forward for the developer's next game, My Time at Sandrock. I couldn't play on pc so I hope they'll port it to mobile version too. I don't mind spending money to support this developer. Thank you for porting this game to mobile!

scenes, cut, Everything was working fine in the game... Until I became pregnant, I gave birth without knowing, there were no cut scenes of me in the hospital, I received a bunch of notifications that I didn't feed the baby and my baby is NOWHERE to be found, I've searched everywhere and the baby doesn't show up anywhere but I keep getting notifications that I didn't feed the baby..... HELP. And I'm super sad I didn't see the scene of my child's birth, what an awful bug.

save, daily, the game is good but why the cloud save interface so confusing? I accidentally deleted my saves - when the daily save is newer then the game should remove the older auto-save one. i needed to delete the older autosave and then bam!! ALL my saves disappeared!! also when u want to play on another device such as bluestack - why does it not auto load? why do i have to upload my saves to cloud everytime? I don't understand these things please someone help!!
quest, poluting, Please delete the poluting water - rat king quest in the sewer, really iritating. The problem can't be solved , is it a bug? Probably i just gonna restart over the game and just ignore the main quest to enjoy the game.

game, Great, despite having lost 8 days of gameplay due to save files problem, I managed to replay the game and return to my 8 days state in just 2-3 days so I guess it's cool, and 5 stars because bugs were fixed and I managed to continue quests without any problem like quests not triggering and such. Great game overall.
game, beautiful, I did finish download it. I thinks its really beautiful game with cartoony style, character costumization also give multiple options such as voices for our avatar etc. Im looking forward experince the game even more. I give 4 stars for now. Thank you devs.

gameplay, Smooth, Smooth gameplay, great storyline, graphics is not so bad. This game is more story-focused where you'll receive missions one after another, however it also gives players freedom to explore the world, do commissions and socialize with NPCs. Similar concept like other popular simulation games. If you're a fan of simulation games, you'll love this game. However this game is more inclined towards calm and relaxing nature, it's not for everyone. If you preferred action RPG, this is not for you.

fps, locked, Could use another fix. Just at complete random the game will decide it is time to drop from 60 fps to a locked 22 fps. My Samsung galaxy note 20 ultra shows it can handle this game at 60 fps anywhere in the game but the game refuses to allow full gpu usage. My metrics only show about 43% gpu usage to get 60 fps on highest settings. Could you fix this for a more stable 60? Even restarting the game doesn't help. My phone isn't even close to hot.

fisherman, best, This game is a meaty RPG. Can be played casually or "seriously". That's the beauty of it, you can play however you want. Be the best fisherman? Just focus on planting stuff? Make friends with EVERYONE in Portia? Speedrun the game in 7 hours of gameplay? 150 hours of gameplay? Complete the solo experience on your own accord.

30fps, less, Game is unoptimized on Poco X3 Pro (SD860) after the update. Now I'm getting less than 30fps even on medium graphics setting with 60fps mode enabled.

version, mobile, I loved this game on PC and I'm really happy they made a mobile version. It's a mix of farming, building, fishing, and some hack and slash. The graphics and story are wonderful. As with games like this, I think it would hard/impossible to play on a small/weaker phone but it plays beautifully on my Samsung 21. I'll agree with others that the texts can be hard to read especially with the color scheme. It seems like bugs are getting fixed fairly quickly. Just buy it!

bit, little, I'm Addicted and I'm so happy that it release on android! Thank you!💕. I'm kinda expect the grass will be the same like on Steam, so I'm a little bit annoyed especially how the grass is a little bit taller than the characters. Aside from that love it! keep it up!

port, decent, Seems to be a decent port with good controls and ui, however there are significant fps drops on Samsung galaxy s21 (exynos 2100). I would be grateful if it could be optimized a bit more or provide options to fine tune the graphics. The low preset just looks unpleasant and takes some magic away from the game. Edit : 60 fps has been added. Performance is much better now but there are still fps drops at night or when looking towards the towncenter. Nonetheless, I am updating my review to 5 stars.

experience, Amazing, Amazing experience so far. So many things to do/create and the AI that let NPCs not stick in one place makes it more fun to play. They don't have to be at the shop to sell/buy items. I'm not really fan of mobile games because of the controlling on screen but this game worth the shoulder pain 😂

I'm not really fan of mobile games because of the controlling on screen but this game worth the shoulder pain 😂
tier, Top, Good Job!!! Top tier game for a life stimulation. Im a big fan of harvest moon in ps. Its really great that we have this game in mobile. I really want to buy it in pc but a little expensive for me. Hoping that it can match what on pc platform. Looking forward for better updates.

workshop, portable, I love My Time at Portia since i played it on PC. I remembered i spent 400 hours on the pc part. Now the game is on mobile, it's like a portable workshop come to my hand. There are some bug here and there, yet i'm happy the interface are clean. The only drawback here are it's unable to load my save game from pc counterpart. I really hope in the future they implement this, just like Stardew valley.

things, other, The game so for has met and exceeded my expectations, I expected some hits on graphics and other small things because my phone isn't a computer, to handle a full released game on a phone is a great accomplishment I'd take it gladly just so I could play it anywhere, the game still needs some tweeks for controls and game play, a bigger fish bubbles & a town time stamp while fishing and bigger announcements banner/sound for special events like fireside meetings/play/dates so you don't miss them

games, best, One of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. For me, my gameplay was very smooth and there were no bugs. I love and enjoy every minute of it; from the characters to the story. This is worth the money, I tell ya. For me, this became my dream game. This deserves a five-star rating <3

port, great, Thank you so much for such a great port of the game to Android. The game runs almost with no flaws or drop in fps when I played.It's wonderful. However,I experienced problem with the controls. When I press the joystick pad for around 1-5 minutes, the arrow usually got stuck on one place and my character will keep walking/running to the wall or sometime into the water.In most case, I'd open the map or inventory to get rid of it.But it happen so many times.I turned off auto sprint but still happen

version, android, Love this game since pc version, but it would be better if the android version have a controller support.
jaw, lower, I do love this game, got it on steam and on my switch, so it was also a must have for my mobile. Until now I have just a few Problems a) my characters lips look a bit weird, makes her look as if she had tusks in her lower jaw. b) the sprint key is in a bad position, I read a complain that someone had trouble not to sprint all the time; I have trouble to use sprint at all c) The "Sort All" option doesn't work, pressing the key does nothing at all.

area, wider, Hey developers, I rated it 4 cuz the skill tree seems to be not working at all. Beside, upgraded tools like pickaxe only hits a wider area, and does not help collect more ore.

world, open, I'm really enjoying that this game is open world and that there isn't ads or additional costs once bought. However after I'd playing for 3 days and making a fair amount of progress the game froze and my Samsung UI failed. I had to do a soft reset on my phone. When opening the app again it remained frozen so I deleted it and reinstalled it. My game data hadn't saved properly despite saving to the cloud. The most recent save was from the 1st day of playing. Really annoying. Please fix this issue.

game, Great, Great game and very nice port! I typically despise virtual gamepads, but this works really well. Layout is intuitive. Runs smoothly with any graphics option on my Note 20 Ultra. Knocked out about 24% of my battery over 1.5 hrs so it does suck up some juice. However, this isn't too surprising (nor that bad) considering the graphics. Overall, definitely a worthy purchase. I got it on sale, but its easily worth full price.

screen, same, I also have the commerce guild bug, where as soon as I enter, it freezes not just the game but my phone. Tried to open the app again, but it just loads the same bugged screen and then followed by black screen/freeze phone. I had a hard time rebooting it. PLEASE FIX IT. I love this game so much.

fan, massive, I would rate this 5 star but because it does not support controller support I feel it should only be 3, I will change if or when it does support controller. I have this on all platforms and kickstarted sandrock so I am a massive fan but I do feel let down as been waiting for mobile port since day dot and the touch detect my thumbs correctly. Please sort this out.

port, Fantastic, Fantastic port of a game 🙂 have this on Xbox One since day of release and now also on mobile. So far cannot fault the game, they have made it simple to play and adapted it well to Mobile with the save feature on exiting the game via menu and the map being able to put a marker down and automatically running there. These are two awesome features.

game, Amazing, Amazing game so far. I was looking for a farming game that is not the usual plant and log out thing and this seems to be it, with relationships and places to explore. Love the graphics, the calm atmosphere and the multitude of details. The quests/commissions are just complex enough to hold your attention. I am only on day 5, so I can't say too much about how it progresses as a game, but so far everything is going great. Looking forward to exploring this world which promises to be intriguing.

graphics, great, I'm enjoying this game so far. Some of it has been challenging to figure out, but it was worth the time to problem solve until I figured out how to complete each task. This game has great graphics, and is very creative. Definitely worth the money.

port, Good, It's def worth the money. Runs well. The controller isn't really needed. Good port having played it on PC first. It has a reasonable downgrade in graphics for a phone game. But it looks great with the cartoon look on a 6.5ish inch screen.

colors, light, Unreadable, I love the PC platform but the lettering is too small for a 5" screen. The light pastel colors make it worse. If they make it more accessibility friendly in future updates, then I'll change my review.

porting, Awesome, Awesome porting from PC! Hey dev, can you make this game run 60fps or higher? I think 30fps did not enough 😃 And also maybe in future updates, the other maps will unlock right?

game, great, Love game but wish it synced with Xbox... But definitely a great game on mobile too!
games, best, Been waiting for this to come out and after months of waiting I finally am able to play it. One of the best games in mobile right now!
port, perfect, A nearly perfect port of an amazing game! This version does so many things right that other developers should take notes! My only two complaints are the auto run button is awkward and accidentally gets pressed a lot, causing me to run many times when I don't want to, and the text can be very small and hard to read. If we had an option to make the text bigger for smaller screens that would be great. All in all an exceptional game and fantastic translation to mobile devices!

game, good, Hi I found a bug. When I finished making the Dee Dee transport and carried it to the commerce guild for the commission my game froze as soon as I entered the room. I have restarted my phone, I redid the day more than five times now but it still freezes when I enter the guild. What should I do? I'm rating this five star because it's a good game but I can't continue the game if my it keeps on freezing.
gameplay, overall, The overall gameplay was excellent it was engaging and relaxing at the same time, i just so happen to encounter a problem with the inspection mini game at the commerce guild, everytime ypu enter the commerce guild the game freeze and force the game to close or restart the phone entirely. I do hope the developers address this issue.

game, great, This is a great game! It's almost a perfect port from the PC version. I would note in character creation the models lips look broken. Besides that I haven't seen any other errors! Would love some more customization options though!

port, beautiful, A beautiful port of a wonderful game. If you like crafting simulation games like Stardew Valley, Graveyard Keeper, Rune factory 4 or Dragon Quest Builders, you'll love this game too. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to support all devices - namely chromebooks. Runs and works great on my phone (4G RAM) but doesn't even get to the loading screen on my chromebook (16G RAM). Definitely worth every penny if you have the hardware to run it but can't give it an unreserved recommendation right now.

playthrough, 3rd, My 3rd playthrough combining with PC gameplay. The transition is smooth so far with actually an amazing control. You know I found this developer is passionate with the game and it is worth it to support them. Cant wait for first time at sandrock.

expectations, low, I had low expectations of this, since it's a ported console game, but it blew my expectations out of the water! It's every bit as good as the console versions, and runs perfectly on my Galaxy S 20.

scenes, cut, I like this game but my character's mouth looks really weird, and it's quite distracting. It makes the cut scenes with my character look so odd. I will change this to 5 stars if the mouth gets fixed.
game, nice, It is a really nice game at first but now it keeps on freezing. I tried restarting the game and my phone as well but it is still the same. Please fix it!!! I really like this game.

game, Great, Great game. Great Port. I actually prefer this over Xbox version. However, it needs controller support. I can't use my Razer Kishi android controller with this game. 5 stars if I could.

game, Pretty, Pretty solid game, fun and you can play the game at your own pace. the only problem is that there is no controller setting, I can't use my ipega gamepad :( glad the touch control is really good, but still connecting to my gamepad would be blast

clouds, dark, Game runs great on huawei p30 pro however I noticed that precipation effect doesn't show when it rains in game. You can see dark clouds, thunder sound but not precipation sound and it's not visible. It doesn't even show on highest graphic settings so hope it can be patched as there is precipation effect option and it does nothing to change anything in game. Anyway the game is really fun, controls are well thought out and should run great on similar phones that I have.

device, same, Edited : I meant save on the same mobile device not bring my switch save to my mobile. I'll check to make sure it's saved then when I close the game out it deletes the whole thing. I don't think leaving on In background should be answer but it feels like the only way to go.

instructions, unclear, The game is beautiful but I think I spotted a bug or maybe unclear instructions, there is a mini game called roping, no matter what I do, animals don't come to me and I lose the rope... I suggest having a tutorial for these mini games better than instructions that are unclear... 3 stars now, please fix my problem, consider changing events and minigames into tutorials and you'll have 5 stars...

date, certain, Something wrong it just me or anyone else also experienced this, it freeze when entering commerce guild at certain date in the game, it happened twice for me. the first time i just reload my game in the bed and skip the entire day without entering the commerce guild, and the next day it's normal. But these issues still there for the second time it freeze again. Well sure it will kill the mood if it happened again, reload my game and avoid the day without entering the commerce guild.

game, sim, Love this life sim game. But this port is a bit unpolished for my liking like font is too small for sub 6" phone display, map is cluttered for a small screen device and, also the game is a bit laggy and unoptimised. Am looking forward for future update.

game, typical, Its nice to see this game come to mobile. I'm kind of getting tired of the typical "mobile" game which always feels hollow. This game is exactly like the pc version. The controls feel good and it works well on my S10+.

game, beautiful, I loved this game from the get go on Nintendo switch. So as you can imagine my face when I see this absolutely beautiful game in the app store 😍 🥲 lol. It's a very relaxing slice of life game with stunning graphics and accompanied with beautiful music that really sets the tone. There really is lots to do in here from fishing, gathering, mining, crafting, upgrading, fighting and socialising with the NPC's even play rock, paper, scissors to build relationships and ultimately fall in love. Enjoy.

game, Great, Great game to have in mobilr and in steam. I font know where to get energy though. Fighting a lvl 30 NPC was a blast (lvl 1)
game, mobile, The game started off good, but as soon as I created my character, I was kicked out of the app, and I kept getting kicked out whenever I tried to continue the game. The lipstick looked smeared on the characters, and just in the character creator my battery drained quickly. I was really excited for this to be a mobile game, since I loved the Xbox and PC versions.
Runs, great, I've played this on the PC and loved it and now I'm so glad it's on mobile so I can play anywhere. Literally hours and hours of things to do. Graphics are great, the voice acting is new since I last played and enhances the game. Runs great on the Samsung Note20 People moaning about the price, you get what you pay for and it's probably one of the most involved mobile game available at this time. No ads, no video rewards or waiting on energy .

drag, simple, Warning if Your looking for a multiplayer experience do not buy this game other then that the story, graphics,combat is so fluent and perfected even to the way you can navigate thru. Items and be able to follow things your trying to make with a simple drag it's a system I wish most sandbox rpgs would follow

value, good, good value for the price, makes you explore the environment around... 1 quirk tho, my phone almost died bec there was no notification inside the game (using samsung galaxy s10 edge). keep it up guys
port, fantastic, A fantastic port of the PC version! This is my 4th copy (PC, XB1, switch and now this) and I'm thrilled with the mobile game. Especially love the new save feature for it, I'd like to see that added on my other copies tbh. Definitely worth the $. The only "downside" is it does drain my battery, but most big mobile games do, so nbd.

The only "downside" is it does drain my battery, but most big mobile games do, so nbd.

trips, long, Giving this 5 stars, I have over 150 hours in pc version. This is my go to for mobile. Can't wait to be able to do so more on the go, long trips just got more fun.

game, best, best game ever!!!!
things, most, Personally i think games with mechanics like this are going to be hard with a button layout. But from playing previously on xbox and pc it became so easy i can play with one hand for most things, mining is a bit weird though.... otherwise great game

gameplay, much, This is one of those games where you will really get your money's worth with how much gameplay and content this has. I'm surprised that apart from its simulation aspect, it also has some rpg elements like monster fighting and skill point distribution. It's easy to learn and play, although loading screens take a few seconds to load, it's not too bad. It's also playable offline so that alone makes this a great purchase for me. Looking forward to future updates! Congrats on the game release!

graphics, good, Really good graphics, nice storyline and really needs brainstorming in order to solve things. Me and my husband both enjoy playing it so much. Worth the money and hoping to see more great future content! ♡

bit, little, Love it ! A little bit hard but make me calm and more thinking while playing this game
bit, little, Looks like harvest moon, a little bit cliché but i think i play more to see what you guys bring to audience
game, best, My best game ever exist in android so far
port, great, This is actually a great port. Controls take some getting used to if you're coming from console or PC. Love the graphics.
emulator, android, I love the Switch game, bugs and all (which is why this version got even three stars) but it wouldn't open on my Chromebook (I have the android emulator installed and successfully run other Android games, so that's not the issue). I got a refund (but very disappointed because I really love this game).

mode, silent, Update: silent mode was on thanks for the tip. Original: "Really pleasant experience I just can't change the volume settings on the game, like they are all the way up as is my phone volume and still no sound otherwise no complaints. Graphics are great"

issues, graphical, About what i expected for mobile though there are a couple graphical issues. The mouths seem to be colored oddly as they seem to have smeared lipstick. Also sometimes the voice acting seems fuzzy for the second female voice. I'm on a tab s7+. But even with the issues still enjoyable.

time, hard, earlier having hard time to login cause of google play issues and it happened to some of us but thank you for fixing it. I could be able to play it today and it run smoothly on my phone. the colour tone is good, it made the graphics even better. so far I didnt find the bugs. Thank you for the benefit, got some rewards like outfit and stuff, and also could be able to hear Paulie's voices (which I never heard before on console), so im hoping not much bugs -or none- in the future.

setting, lowest, Wanted to love this but can't. Graphics are good but even changing to the lowest setting battery drains too fast. Controls are impossible for larger phones or people with smaller hands. Playing this on a tablet will be impossible. This game should have really been reduced better for mobile.

game, huge, This game needs to be compatible with controllers. Its a huge, grinding game, and it makes no sense to not use conttollers when all others platforms can. Fix it.

bug, only, The only bug I encountered is the Google play games login bug. The control fells great and the visual is almost as close as what you get when wp laying it on pc. I already this is going to be great as the controls are well converted to mobile. Good job devs.

port, Amazing, Amazing port of an amazing game! Looks and runs beautifully on mobile, and plays really well too! If you're a fan of farming RPGs (Stardew, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, Etc), definitely give this one a go. Dungeon crawling, crafting, relationships, exploration, it's all here and all wonderful. This is my preferred way to play the game and I recommend it to anyone interested in the title!

menos, Mais, Mais ou menos
port, good, Really good port. Worked fine with my Xbox one controller, but the touch controls look and feel really good. Also having the play games connection issue, but just press outside the dialogue to close it. Devs will fix that soon enough
support, widescreen, Wish there was an option for 60fps but I do appreciate the widescreen support. This is one of the best bang for your buck games. 100 hours for me to beat the campaign on PC.

game, decent, You can't connect to Google play games and the characters look like they have lipstick smeared all over their mouths but if you can look past that, it's a pretty decent crafting game.

game, fun, They say its fun game and I'll try.
