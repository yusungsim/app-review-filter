match, with, ad, False advertisement, the gameplay doesn't match with the ad. I played evertale months ago, the game tricked you with the rpg-like gameplay on the first chapter but then chapter 2 comes and it's just a regular stage selecting gacha game. You can catch monsters but the strongest monsters are incredibly underpowered comparing to the microtransaction monsters. The only progression you could make after finishing the tutorial part of this game is via gacha units/items from microtransaction.

killed, on, YouTube, Please stop advertising this ad where something is horribly killed on YouTube or anywhere else. I'm getting tired of it.
gotten, off, characters, Extremely bad rates. Don't bother whaling here tbh. I've actually gotten more off banner characters than the rate up characters. The ads were right! it is a horror game......at least the gacha portion is.

playing, on, console, awesome game feel like playing on a console a little confusing with the monsters and characters but hey what game isnt
m, like, game, Im very like this game, because the story mode and a garbage of feature and event story... But, everything will will be unfair after you keep your soulstone for an almost impossible SSR char and unfair rank that make u feel backward. Because the SSRs r 1:200 to get, unfair raid mode, and the game dev dont response your opinion to make this game more better. Because they r just focus updating in char & event updates, not doing problem fix updates. Thats make this game sucks and cant played by F2P

wasted, for, Astrid, Big scam game .I wasted 7000 soul stones for endless Astrid which has chance up but I got only kirin.this game is a waste.
bombarded, with, that, Dull repetive pay to win game, not to mention the blatant false advertising that I've been constantly bombarded with only to find out, NONE OF IT IS IN THE GAME. Pretty sure they're buying good reviews, save your time and don't play this game. Report all of their ads as inappropriate because of their false advertising and also horrifying imagery depicting decapitation and extremely violent themes, all of which isn't in the game btw.

earning, for, summons, pretty fun but earning gems for summons takes a very long time, and when you do summon you get a weapon instead of a character
went, from, evolving, This game went from good evolving to 18+ evolving. It is a challenge to beat and is enjoyable till you have to summon for monsters. The newer characters/monsters are very NSFW. I wish there was an option to turn off the NSFW content because every single character has turned into a NSFW contest. Also the rates on this game are very bad compared to similar games.

saw, from, them, I don't know dick about this game, but an ad I just saw from them has stolen monsters from a game called Neo Monsters that came out years ago. Not cool. Use your own monsters in your ads.

look, like, game, The ads are extremely misleading. Its made to look like a horror pokemon pixel game but ends up being a gacha that looks nothing like the ads. I want my money back
bored, into, game, Got bored 2 seconds into the game
mf, With, dumb, Why is there a need for auto battle??? With dumb mf AI
shows, in, commercials, This add is a false advertisement. I bought this game & it's NOTHING like is advertised. Fun game indeed. But an extremely heavy at 2 win game & is nothing like the pokemon style games like it shows in all the commercials
put, on, top, It would be cool to see some jokes in the game. I dont like it to be serious at all times because its stressing the heck out of readers. If I was the writer I would add some relatable jokes and sarcasms. Sure wholesome chit chat moments and motivate each other to get their spirit up would put a smile, but having no humor is like not having to put *a cherry on top of beatiful layered cakes you know? I guess it wouldnt be convinient to add them now, future games I guess would be ideal.
see, for, game, While being able to download this app for free ( instead of the previous 99 cents) I was able to play and found myself slightly entertained, however the constant ads I see for this game presenting itself as an 8 Bit Horror Creepypasta version of Pokemon is textbook False Advertising. If the developers had any confidence in their game, they would drop the act and show REAL in-game footage. The game itself is just fine. But the advertising around it is a sham. 1 star.

saw, for, it, Would not recommend buying because originally I bought this game because I saw a trailer for it on YouTube what made it look like some type of horror style pokémon game and I was interested but after getting into it I realized it was less bloody and less interesting and it was nothing like the trailer :( And I found it annoying needing to download every battle before it initiates.

is, Like, apps, A story rich and compelling game, yet one feature made me uninstall. Like most apps, there is a free alternative to purchasing items via daily unlocks of crystals. Except after eventually saving up enough of them to use them, it mentions you can only use them if you acquired that same currency from a real money source. Same currency in game, but you have to actually buy it in real life to use it.

get, for, roll, No thank you, am not playing this game anymore. You spend freaking 3000 soulstones (i am a F2P player) and get only 1 sr weapo for every roll. Seriously? Im quitting this game.
saving, from, wrath, Evertale is amazing! I love it. Reminds me of saving Galar from the wrath of Eternatus in Pokemon Sword and Shield Five stars from me. And the music! I purposefully kept on walking i the grass to hear the wild monster Battle theme

made, of, money, I enjoy the game. Fairly generous to f2p players and I'm not exactly f2p but not made of money either. It's fun. I will say I caught a nocteddy and ran afterwards and it turned into a Roro. Apparently you gotta finish the battle for the game to register your catch correctly. Fun though.

bother, with, game, Don't bother with this game. Been playing for awhile now, it starts good but it seems like the devs stopped caring, features that made the beginning of the game unique have been stripped away and by 2.0 Evertale is just another standard gacha RPG among thousands. The current ads are strange and misleading, new character designs have ridiculous amounts of fan service even by gacha game standards, best to just avoid this sinking ship of a game altogether.

do, after, boss, It just gets impossible to do after the cloning boss who clones itself like 7 times ,lord 0 star

focus, on, characters, Been playing this game since it was released, and I must say that you have a really low summoning rate for SSR characters. Another thing is you focus too much on lewd characters that you forget to improve or make new male or monster SSR characters.
get, through, stage, This game has a good beginning story but after that the online story is work just to get through. You are charged mana to get through each stage of the online story. The obtaining of characters through a gacha system is annoying at best and frustrating. Beware that you will have to drop money to get the event characters. You will be left with nothing to do after you have done you daily tasks. I encourage the developers of this game to try to find a way to keep my interest for longer than 20mins.

looking, for, game, Is a very enjoyable game. Ive been looking for a game like this. Loads of characters, not to hard to control. But as the others have said, is a kind of pay to win. Ive been in a level where there is no possible way to win no matter how many times I level up, and change stragedys. Only way is to pay. Overall is a very good game; enjoyable with mutiple things like storylines, etc. 👌⭐⭐⭐⭐ (PS this game is not horror AT All)
heals, to, health, This game is not good the boss was one shot it was my collector's tongue Max level I hit him and it does 1 damage and he heals all the way to full health
upgrading, in, game, I'm having trouble upgrading my characters in game every time I do it says there's a connection problem until that's fixed I'm not going to play the game other than that it's fun
PAY, for, it, i formatted my device, and now i cant re-install the game anymore until i PAY for it. -_- wonderful
drop, to, SSR, I have to change my opinion cause the gacha rate to have a SSR character i spend 3~5d to have a 10x summon but it only drop SR weapon and SSR weapon sometime SR character I have to much SSR and SR weapon 60+ SR weapon and 20+ SSR weapon i spend many time to summon 10x but now i only have 5 SSR character :( Dam wut a hard drop rate=/
get, to, game, It's a good game but why does it keep syncing 😭 It didn't bother me at first as it was quick and not often. But now I'm unable to even get to my game for some reason. Still a good game though. Have it on my tablet 👌

move, in, act, Uhmm can we move freely in act 2 storyline and im tired waiting for my mana to fully recover i cant grind properly act 2 really ruins the game but the story is good though
Spent, on, game, Spent plenty of money on this game. As soon as I changed phones, everything was gone. They owe me my $ if they can't support my playing this.
challenging, to, degree, I enjoy the Pokemon like aspect and the numerous amounts of characters. It's even challenging to a degree which I like. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because character movement isnt exactly easy.
had, after, bit, so after a bit of time I had to change my review, The gatcha rates for characters are abysmal out of 30+ 10x pulls I have only managed to get one character out of them all not to mention getting the materials to level up said character is so mind numbingly slow you can only promote the character from raid materials which only happens twice a day the games grind is insanely slow after you get through the initial story and the mana system sucks

starts, as, game, This game starts off pretty fun as an idle gacha game with lots of battles in story mode, but after your done with story mode, there really isnt much to do except for limited quest events which last 2 weeks. Gacha rates are terrible - 500 for pity and you may end up burning your wallet just for a certain character. Upgrading characters is even worse, with the increasing "potions" required locked behind gem payments. Maybe do consider making these "potions" more easily attainable :)

paying, for, it, Don't expect a good character without paying for it... the rng is bs... story is lame... game play is meh. Don't install.
got, at, 10x, The summoning system in this game is subpar with the fact that event weapons and characters are in the same banner with SSR Weapon being 4% and SSR Character being 1%. Spent 17k soulstones and only got the character at my last 10x while I probably got more than 8 SSR weapons.
seeing, in, Homepage, Why this garbage still exist tho ?, I'm tired seeing this trash game in my Homepage
replaced, with, mode, Borderline p r o n game.Bearable story, kinky outfits, horrendous gacha rate.Worse still they removed the pvp and replaced it with an auto battalion mode, terrible decision as that was the game's only saving grace.Definitely P2W,farming resources takes too much time.Past SSRs are severely weak compared to present ones.The devs most likely wont rebalance them.In short,don's waste your time here like me,spend it elsewhere wisely.If you don't have a reason to stay away,hey,at least do it for me!Thx

rate, in, half, Best game there is! But worst gacha game there is! So will rate in half.
thought, through, hard, One of the best games I have ever played. The story is amazing. Characters are all really cool. The combat system is so amazing and you can tell they thought it through very hard. The only thing I can say I don't like about this game is the amount of story they have isn't unlimited so if u play it for like a year you eventually run out of story. However good news they are constantly making more story. But yeah great game u should definitely download.

save, for, pulls, Game is good, but it is very hard for free players to get gems for summons. Probably the least generous game for new players that I have seen, and when you do save enough gems for a few pulls you will not get an SR or SSR character you will only get weapons and a bunch of garbage characters. Units and weapons should not be in the same summon period. 10 of the x10 banner summons and not a single sr or ssr character, weapons only. Save your money....
stuck, at, 5/24, When downloading additional resources it stuck at 5/24 .... I think I will uninstall this game
had, with, it, this game is 2 star game as I only had fun with it for a day than it became a Hassel. I marked it down to 1 for the misleading ads. Quite happy I didn't spend money on it and got it for free.

got, to, waifu, its a monster collector + gacha hero collector game, it got some fierce looking monster to some very cute waifu. imo the game is more to the p2w side of things, but its nothing important as they give lot of premium currency. so far its a really great game and the story is good. i rlly like it, big up tp the dev😁😁
playing, for, time, it took an exceedingly long time for this game to start and finish the content download but once it did man was this game good I really enjoy playing it as I have wanted to for a long time Sence I first saw it advertise on YouTube I would highly recommend this as it's just awesome

adjust, to, time, More online story please and more soulstones in events. And adjust your server time to previous time. Too much trouble with this 1 hour forward time
spent, in, game, Decent so far. UPDATE 11/17/21: Had to delete. I've spent money in this game but cannot pull a decent character. All I get is normal weapons. Cannot waste anymore time or money for basically nothing. Held on for as long as I could.

appearing, in, game, As a player of the 1.0 version of the game, I'm greatly disappointed of the many good events no longer appearing in the game. The pity is ridiculous, and the purchasing price for the premium currency is awful. This is basically the Dark Souls version of gacha games. Either be super lucky or super rich. The grinding is now VERY tormenting, and not so rewarding, especially as if the game is always hinting for you to pay to win. There is better gacha than this scum of a game.
need, pf, them, Edit back, the gacha rate seem retarded, so hard to get 1, when u need like 5 pf them to full awaken. Im only have one ssr that because of paid crystal. To collect crystal for player is hard if dont pay. Game is nice but unless u have unlimited money then u can enjoy. The differences between sr and ssr is like earth and sky. Game already long enough but greedy. U guys can play but be prepared for worse memories. I put 2 star because of stories. And much worse the is vip system. Well goodluck..

Prefect, like, things, Prefect like all things should be
play, for, hours, Another greedy games, the drop rate increase is after summon is not right, mana is slow regenerate so you cant play for hours just waiting mana espescially you already finish store. And the mana potion is rare
get, for, me, It's ok. The story is too boring for me, but I enjoyed the Snow White sub story, and I think those little stories are probably the best they got, but it's still nothing amazing. Gameplay is neat. Very simple and quick RPG, but lots of different things to make team building neat and possibly interesting. I hate Gachas the mix weapon with heroes, and I absolutely hate the rates in this game. Finally, a lot of the female designs and art get way too lewd for me. I think some surpass Azur Lane.
move, in, story, It's hard to get even 1 SSR I try 70 of 10times summons even one I don't get and my enemy have SSR line up it was so strong that I can't even move in another online story I think I gonna quit the game 6 days with no progress😂

Finished, without, numbers, Reinstalled and is still the worst drop rate of any gotcha game I've played. Finished the offline story mode without a 5☆ bad gatcha numbers
downloading, for, resources, Great game but whenever I enter something, it starts downloading for resources, it's fine by me but my problem is that whenever I download it says that I don't have internet connection when it is fully functioning when using other apps. I just want to play the game, pls.
speak, to, stuff, I think it's as good as as mobile games are going to get. graphics are cool, story is interesting enough, good variety of monsters and characters. I just played the story so I can't speak to the online stuff. Definitely worth the playthrough if you like turn based RPGs.
Lost, due, update, Lost data due to the update. Lost my account and they have not contacted me after I sent my information. Do not recomend spent a LOT on this game for nothing.

feel, like, type, Good art but nothing special. It quickly becomes a chore to do much and the story is pretty short. Advertised and even set up early on to feel like one type of game, yet it quickly becomes a pretty generic gacha game
find, in, game, It's pay to win and it's falsely advertised. You will find no horror in this game. You'd have to be insanely lucky with this game's low gacha rates to get anything good, and max it out.
guarantee, on, banner, rate up sucks not even guarantee ssr char on limited banner
Lead, to, scenes, Too much. A lot going on. HEAVY pay to win. Definitely had some fun but finished the og story mode and was sick of the cut scenes even with the fast forward. "Let's take a break here." Lead to many cut scenes of 'sexy' characters. Already deleted and moved on.
shaft, on, summons, Fun, simple, and fantastic, a fantasy rpg that doesn't shaft you on the summons. I cannot say enough good about this game, just wish it'd have the option to look at the rates of every summon

verything, about, system, If you take verything bad about Genshins gacha system and magnify them you have Evertale. No pity rate, characters and weapons are pulled from the same pool, No welfare SSRs, Banners locked behind paid gems. Do not wate your time and please don't waste your MONEY. Shame on this app...

shown, in, ads, Way too expensive. Different stats and items are hard to understand. Also nothing like what is shown in the ads.
get, into, story, Game itself is really nice, the story is superb. The problem is this game is relly much on SSR character. Meanwhile, this game we're kinda bad for the soulstone grinding. When you get into online story, you have to rally much on character from other people to help you out which making the game kinda not fun. So anyway this game having a NORMAL gacha rate, slow soul stone grinding and really rally on SSR character, well strategy also needed. Other than that like story, music, gameplay is the best

have, In, gacha, Nice story, Love the characters, but It's hard to get SSR In the gacha, I only have 2. u have 5% chance to get one SSR maybe fix that. Plus If u want to buy something, It's expensive. But It's not hard game to play If u know the strategy 😎
log, into, game, What the hell is happening ? Since the update I am not able to log into the game ! I wrote the support now 3 Times and nobody is answering, like what is going on ? I really enjoy this game, but now it is making me really upset. I hope you guys can fix that, so I can change my rating..
seperated, into, two, Three stars, why is there paid gems and normal gems? Like this is actually outrageous, every gacha games have only one of them and are not seperated into two, adjust this and I will share it to my friends. And also, you need to draw 1thousand times to get a single ssr item?(except the first guaranteed ssr item). Just how the f?

done, with, story, Great art, easy to figure out game mechanics, interesting character, overall not a bad game. The two down sides to this game is: 1. They could have done more with the story. The story give you that old handheld Final Fantasy feel with not much to do or explore. 2. They need to separate the weapon drops from the character drop. Since that is there big draw and push is characters and weapons drops they should separate them so people can pick which they prefer.

characters, after, summon, SSR characters too hard .enen after 14000 summon not one ssr character
follow, on, Twitter, I like the game but the promotion to follow them on Twitter for premium currency is not working. It's been 2 days and the game does not recognize it.

get, over, advertising, I can't get over the false advertising and the predatory practices that the developers seem to employ. They treat this game like a money pit and every decision they make reinforces that idea.

paid, for, game, Not the game they advertised. Fun but i paid the money for a different game... Kinda cheap move. And while you can catch a few monsters in the start, you will soon find you wadted your time, as amyou can only catch R monsters or less. Update: And the fun kinda ends with the single playet campaign, unless you are looking for somewhere to sink your cash in. :)

show, to, much, I really enjoy this game although some of the characters show way to much please add a little more clothing
complaining, about, characters, Game is epic people are complaining about SR and SSR characters they should use 10 summon for guarantee of SR . I wish there was some choices we can make and few more endings.

knock, to, star, It's been said before, but feel the need to repeat. This game is in no way like their ads or even these preview images. The ads are 8 bit pokemon-esque clips and this game is a 3/4 angle 2d sidescroller with a busy combat UI and no hidden bloody lore to speak of. The game play is okay, so I'm not gonna knock it down to a total one star, but the incredibly misleading ads just really aren't a hit with me so I'm not a fan.
CAME, FROM, ADS, IF YALL CAME FROM THE HORROR ADS AND IS INTERESTED BECAUSE OF IT, PLEASE DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. FALSE ADVERTISING TO THE FINEST. ALTHOUGH THE OFFLINE MODE IS INTERESTING, IT GETS DULL OVER TIME.

compared, to, gachas, We all know the ads are misleading, so there's that. Also, compared to other gachas, the pull rates are abysmal (gotta do a 10x pull 50 times before you get a guaranteed pity pull? Yeesh). They keep redesigning characters to make them "sexier" (RIP to the original Mysha). The story is fine, it has some nice moments. Alliance war is different & fun. However, the only reason I'm still playing is the great player base. It's fun just to hang and chat after you run out of energy.
went, through, hell, The game is good I actually went through hell and back to get a Twitter account so I can get the 1000 soul stones but I want to know something so devs(developers) if u see this pls answer how much time do u need to summon to get an SSR

playing, at, store, this game is great, been playing games on at store for a long time, and this one is the first one in a long time that has got me excited.

Uses, on, Facebook, Uses misleading ads on Facebook to sucker you in. This is not a horror/lovecraftian pokemom.
collecting, with, logins, So much fun! This is a complex game, but once you get the hang of collecting gems and things with daily logins, you can play most of the fun stuff for free, even pulling worthwhile cards. Highly recommend.
need, for, chance, Decent game. Dailies are a bit of a hassle. You can't do them all without reaching a high enough level. You need alot of gems for a chance at characters strong enough to progress in the story. Just looking for a game where you don't need a ton of cash and grind to just chill and play. Tired of seeing sales on every single game where what you get isn't worth the high cost. A little adjustment would go a long way for something this well designed though.

advertised, as, horror, not bad, the story is great and the art style is nice however the gameplay is simply and the ads I seen, the game was advertised as a horror rpg overall pretty good for mobile
reminds, of, Pokémon, I love the art style and the way the characters are designed. Very polished and good looking. In my opinion the storyline is very good so far. I love all the creatures you can collect, it reminds me of Pokémon but more detailed and more fantasy style. Love the game great job developers! <3
working, after, update, Game stopped working entirely after "new update" won't update just circles back to app store and playing the game. Hit play tells you to update hit update tells you 2 play. Game has no voice chat has no player trade system and is extremely pay to play. Not that paying helps either as you still get stuck with sr and ssr pie es you can't use or do anything with. Wish I had my money back another game to steal all my cash well giving nothing back

comes, to, soul, It's all good, the gameplay, a very good imaginative characters but when it all comes to soul summoning, it almost seems impossible to get the banner. It's been 5 months since my last ssr

updated, after, post, Never got to play. I was very excited to try this game. Anytime I open it, all I get is a white box with a loading circle. I tried to wait it out, but to no avail. Wish I hadn't wasted that 99 cent on it. Update 11.08.2021: The game was updated shortly after my post and I was able to play. I do like this game, but it's not like pokemon in anyway shape or form; I do not love the false advertising. Also, you really need to regularly pay to compete with the other players on the server.

show, in, trailers, I really love the game, but i can only give 4 stars because it actually isn't as dark as they show in the trailers and pictures. Without further talking i can say this game is addicting!
look, like, something, Not a bad game but the ads make it look like something else I expected a Pokemon like horror game but instead got a waifu gacha game fix the ads and the rating will go up
Turned, into, fox, Turned feline Kud story companion into fox eared human lookin bimbo and personality change. Also retconing her backstory and scrubbing her original form. The character design is passable if it went to a new character, but it race swapped one of the more unique designed story characters, into what looks like a fox eared Rizette, like we don't have enough of her in the game as is. I really wanted more for Mysha, but she got done dirty with this.

separate, from, ones, A few bugs. Low RNG. There is no option to separate your paid stones from free ones.
immersed, on, it, Even though it's hard to get at least a SR char. in a 10x summon, the game itself is very enjoyable. The more you play, the more you get immersed on it. This is the first time that i get so hooked in this type of game, and i'm learning a lot. Thank you. 😊😊
give, in, moment, It's fun so I will give it a 4 Star in the moment. But later on it will change. ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
saved, for, weeks, Bad rates summoned 100 times only got 1 ssr and it was a weapon chance for ssr is suppoded to be 5% in total and only got 1 ssr out of 100 and it was a weapon saved up star stones for 3 weeks for this im dropping it rng isnt worth it and star stones are soo hard to get

runs, on, phone, fun game, even runs on my garbage phone
spending, on, it, This game is fantastic, the story is attention grabbing, the side quests are plentiful, the monster raising is on point. I haven't even had to spend a penny yet, though might just to support this developer. Well worth the time, if you don't mind spending your life on it.
win, on, top, pay to win on top of premium game. They lowered the ssr rate also.
win, with, devs, Completely pay to win with greedy devs, and horrible RNG the game itself is ok but good luck paying for ssr characters with less than .07% chance if getting the one you want, you'd need to spend thousands to get the 5 character shards to fully awaken a character. I recommend playing the story mode then deleting it cause there's not much eles to do as a f2p player and online story mode is a gimmick you don't see or interact with real players in that mode.

Spent, for, gems, Summoning needs fixing badly! Spent money for 1000 gems, and when I went to summon 10 summons, someone called my phone. When I went to see my summons, there were none and my 1000 gems were gone. This game robs people paying money

have, for, chapter, they say this is like Pokemon if that's true it's pokemon on drugs the ads do this game no justice this is a much better game then final fantasy 7 and way more active then Diablo my only regret is that it don't have more side quests for chapter 1 if there is a way to add more side quests that can be completed please do otherwise it's perfect
advertise, as, game, completely misleading ads advertise this game as a horror pokemon game, none of the scenes are from the game. the game makes you pay to win.
Thank, for, work, This is a really good game, good story/content, but i think the characters should wear more clothes, because its kinda weird. Also the gacha is really bad, because its only 1% of ssr's and its really hard to earn soul stones, so please, improve the gacha. And also, i think this game is too greedy, i mean, if you buy something, the price is really high and the things you get arent that good, so we would like to see some improvements. That's all. Thank you for your hard work! :D
having, with, it, Decent game! Lives up to expectations, and I'm having fun with it so far. Wishing there was an overlay control, just to make moving around the overworld a little bit easier. Other than that, no complaints!

used, to, it, this game is very fun and addicting, the story is so amazing and you seriously can't get enough of it! although moving around is hard but you'll get used to it!
imagining, in, game, Amazing storyline and Characters I love this game makes me feel like I am in a anime myself, also I find myself imagining myself in the game as well!
drain, into, it, Game is really fun. Intriguing story, and the character designs are amazing. My only issue is that it's super easy to drain all my cash into it. I loved the game, yet I am unable to play it until my spending habits are better😅
advance, after, point, A good game, but I Uninstalled when I realized it was a pay to play game. They give out gems so sparingly that you advance EXTREMELY slowly after a point. If you plan on spending $50-60 in a game, then this is a good game for you. If not, look elsewhere.

awsome, on, ch, awsome so far on ch 2
built, on, lies, A game built on lies and deceptions not a horror game at all
play, with, style, looks amazing but i refuse to play with this control style.
read, for, characters, New update has ruined the game ..............have done 3 1000 soul summon and NOT one SR or SSR character.......fix your game............10 K in paid soul stones for 3 SSR characters........28K soul stones (yes you read correct)...for NO SSR characters.........PAY to WIN PAY to PLAY
kicks, after, lines, The ads and etc made it so cool, but it doesn't work...The game kicks me and my friends out after the first lines of dialogue. Please fix
traumatized, with, ads, This traumatized my kid with your false horror ads. Expect a Class action lawsuit soon
waiting, for, long, I'm so happy it's finally free I've been waiting for so long and it finally paid off TwT
better, in, way, The game is nothing like what it used to be, not that it was all that much to begin with. I don't know where all of our money is going, but it clearly isn't being used to better the game in any meaningful way. Also, characters are absolutely meaningless as their designs and backstories can be changed at the drop of a hat.

go, through, story, more free events and diamonds please, i llove the game this cause you go through the story.
grind, with, monsters, Did you like Gameb*y Pokem*ns & Fin*l F*ntasy 3/6? Do you wanna see a lot of generic white T&A anime stills? With an equally generic plot? Do you wanna grind with cool monsters and random NPCs? I'm critical of games I enjoy, and I'm gonna play a lot of this while avoiding "microtransactions".
dump, in, game, After you beat the first story mode the game becomes Mana dependent for most things. Also, you can dump 400$ in the game and never get the final awaken piece for a champion. Get rid of mana requirements and I'll put it 5* the final awaken is annoying but it's not game breaking like the mana system.

used, within, times, You guys have the worst sr and ssr character rate drop. The chances of getting a sr and a ssr weapon is much higher than a character drop. Only characters I have been getting are just rare characters. I have used the 1k gems summon 3 times and within those 3 times. I have already gotten 3 ssr weapons. I would say 2 more times but those were just the same weapons. So fix your character rate drop when summoning cuz as of rn sr and ssr weapons are already extremely guaranteed.
expected, from, jrpg, love the game so much this is what I expected from jrpg
engaging, like, games, smooth and nice gameplay, didn't expect to be hooked by this game ,the script/dialogues are well written imo, it's engaging and not boring ,dull or robotic like most rpg games nowadays.. overall , it's fun , engaging and pretty light, not too fast or too slow paced.. very recommended if you're a fan of old school rpg .. the only downside is summon rate
ruining, between, waifus, Goddamn the male mc is not only ugly but also super annoying. His stupid punchable face is everywhere in the main stories, events, even summon banners. He's always ruining perfectly beautiful scenes especially between my waifus by showing up in the middle of conversation. Wish I could delete that beta male from units and always use Rizette as overworld unit. Thank god I've changed my default ingame profile pic because I couldn't stand that ugly bastard's face ugh

advertised, on, YouTube, Not the game I saw advertised on YouTube. Clever trick there's a page on reddit full of people who were duped as well. Really lame of you guys. Lame. Lame. Laaaaame.
crashing, in, while, I love the game play... But I'm having an issue with my game crashing every once in a while... Plz fix this
talking, about, what, Don't like the limited power for your team and items and when I met the elf callen had NO dialog what so ever and was very confusing on what they were talking about
playing, for, while, This game is amazing. I've only been playing it for a little while, but it is perfect for fantesy game lovers like myself. Evertale has an amazing story line with a lot of kick butt characters, wepons, and creatures. Also, It's free! Right now it is compleatly free to play, there are still some in app percheses avalible in game, like buying soul stones and money. I compleatly recomend this game to any fantesy lovers.

reminds, of, games, fun game reminds me of original final fantasy games
seen, on, game, I love the whole world. The story and the artwork are all really unique. However, I can't play a gacha game that gives you a 1% chance at hitting SSR characters. I won't even spend money because those odds are way too low. They are by far the lowest odds I've ever seen on a gacha game. Mixing in the weapons in the character pool is a unique way of making sure it costs users more money to get any good characters. I'll never understand this strategy.

given, for, player, Very low rates for SSR character. Should've given one SSR character instead of SR for new player since SSR really hard to get.
gets, after, mode, I've just realised that after the offline story mode it gets to the point u need to ptw and also the prices you pay are just immeasurable. For exmple a limited pack goes to over a 100. Still tho the game was quite good

Let, via, story, This game is good and story line is ok. The worst thing of this game is p2w system. I hate that summon thing .Better delete that summon thing. Let unlock characters via story .
play, for, minute, Havent been able to play for more than 1 minute before it crashes so I wouldn't know if the game is good or not. Dont know why it wont load and keeps freezing but as it is, its unplayable.
pick, for, teams, Should have auto level up suggestions and pick for teams. Overall it's amazing experience.
fall, for, guys, This game sucks, make you leave no choice to whale. Dont fall for it guys
s, during, events, Theres no free gems during holiday events :(
going, through, story, it's a fun time killer, not much else to say really. I'm still going through the main story, so I cant say much about end game or anything, but it's a fun rpg
Playing, For, Women, Am I Just Playing This For The Sexy Women??
wait, for, arc, Fair gacha, I'll be really honest, this game is great! Can't wait for the new arc! Keep up the awesome work!
spiraled, with, it, I had this game like a year ago and sad to see the state it's become. Its your standard monster training game with gacha mechanics because of course. It had potential but then spiraled with it's add campaigns of showing it as a grim dark horror in the vein of yume Nikki or Omori, when the actual game is mostly happy go lucky. I stopped playing due to the size on my last phone but these false ads drove me away from getting it again once I got a new phone. Not worth the time since the devs suck.

recommend, As, investor, The game is great. Story is good, the collection is great. However after losing my account the support team has let me down. As a once heavy investor I recommend you stay away from this game. I wish their support team cared about us, the players. If this gets them to finalize my request to retrieve my account I will update. Is been 3 weeks and I've gotten one e mail requesting specific information which I acquired and sent only for no further contact.

summon, for, time, I like the story so far and the gameplay my main issue is the summon rate. I play when I have a chance and I'd like to have a better chance than 1% on getting new characters, doesn't seem very worth playing if I can get a decent chance to summon for the available time I put in. Besides that though I do enjoy the other aspect of this game.

keep, until, act, Now that I beat act 10,i think theres no reason to keep playing until new act,story,etc. Stop making lewd characters and focus on the story

proceeded, in, mode, If the game proceeded in offline mode and just had ads for crystals it would be one of the best games. But you don't want that you want easy fast money ...well enjoy

enjoy, for, time, I really enjoy this game, I have been unable to find a game I truly enjoy for a long time but I really love this one.
advertised, as, game, It's okay for what it is, a basic jrpg summoning game, but it advertised itself as a psychological horror game. Deceptive advertising.
challenging, at, point, The story is very engaging and challenging at a certain point. Though I would like to have other ways to get Limit Break Potion for Characters aside from Raids. And also, the Online Story; it should've been just like the offline one that was just free-moving (?) not click on a spot to proceed...

Wait, for, fountain, Haters gonna hate. Play it, dont play it, whatever. As for me im hooked. Also if you dont have 30,000 gems collected, your basicly broke. Wait for the lucky fountain.
according, to, game, The gameplay, music, and art work for this game are all great. But the gacha element kills it. You can train monsters but they are worthless (most ads for this game aren't anything like the game). I spent 35,000 gems (worth about $675 according to the game) and pulled the banner character once.
getting, into, it, I'm just getting into it but I like it so far. I. update my post later with more information.

bought, because, ads, I bought the game because of the misleading ads. Even if it's a decent game, that's not ok.
make, at, point, The devs are just money hungry , if your free 2 play , don't even bother . I just used 3 months of saving soul stones to get a character and didn't even receive it . It doesn't make sense at this point , they're forcing me to give up
playing, for, while, I'm playing this game for a while and I m enjoying it 😆.
connect, with, game, Scammed me out of my money. The ads do not connect with the actual game.
put, to, game, The developers haven't put any new story to the game they keep making the same character so many times and they refused to listen to there fan base the pvp from 2019 was fun but the new idle rewards and waking up at 5:45 am and 10:45pm to get ingredients is old no one has time to keep doing this the only thing they put new in game is a new purchase deal they focus on people buying thins from game instead focusing on story

giving, in, seriousness, Better than PUBG!!! But in all seriousness, first stages of this game are giving of great vibes

make, in, purchases, Where to even begin? How about adds. Show your game for what it is, I have to say other than some other upsetting stuff, its actually a pretty good game. Great story and gameplay. Now a warning for everyone this game, while it isn't a complete gacha game it is partly a gacha game. You don't need to make in game purchases but, as you will figure out a little later, purchase are encouraged. Also the difficulty level, some of these bosses are off the walls. Other than that a pretty good game.
pay, with, model, The worst gacha game I ever played. Ultra low rates, hard to get free diamonds for summoning. Definitively, pay to play (you read right, not even pay to win, pay to play!) with freemium model. Almost impossible to get a single SSR character without spending real money. Please, don't waste your time with this game, it's not worthy.

hooked, within, minutes, This game is great. I was hooked within the first 20 minutes. I am pretty upset that you can't customize your character, or change the name. It is just a set name and a set character, but all that aside, it's still a great game. The story is great, the characters are great. 10/10 recommend!
took, of, sale, I took advantage of the sale that made this game free to play and originally it cost a dollar but once you start playing it you'll find out for yourself that this is a good game and is more than reasonable for the dollar so if it is still free or for a dollar your still getting this game for a steal if not a great deal

go, in, castle, Except from the artwork and coding (that gave this five stars), the game crashes when I try to go in the castle. Please let you see this and fix it. I'm on Android (if it helps).
got, to, point, Kinda liked the game when i first played. Got a bit farther and didn't really like the lewdness and number of girls in bikinis. Stopped playing after i got to a point where you couldn't really make progress anymore and uninstalled the game. A bit later i start seeing ads for this game that were totally different from the actual game, and now It looks like its just suggestive ads now, and the game costs money now... come on, what the heck?

invested, in, game, BAD drop rates on ssr characters, did 20 sums and got the same weapon twice, cannot get invested in the game.
seen, on, page, Nothing like advertised. Didn't get any elements of physiological horror as seen on their page and ads. There's not much to the monster catching, everything is pre-set, you just follow the process. After the first story, the only way to collect new characters is through the gatcha or limited story events.
pulls, for, pity, First of all, 500 pulls for gacha pity is too much for the ssr char. The gacha system is similiar to FGO, the difference is the weapon here have more specific condition to make it maxed the potential (which is can be annoying too). The paid soulstone used first is greatly disappointing, the AI system in alliance war and arena is dumb. I hope the dev add manual control in arena and war. Change the soulstone system to free soulstone used first. Overall gameplay is enjoyable. !Change the ad image!
rip, with, anime, It's only fun if you enjoy a very simple rpg that tries to rip off Pokemon with some other anime. However the game is nothing like most of it's advertisements about being a Pokemon horror game. So false advertising Evertale
play, without, fix, The game lages a lot when you play without internet fix that
lacks, for, bit, Looks decent and lacks alot of creativity fun for a bit but after that is pretty repetitive.
showed, for, game, Scammed I thought this was a horror game that the ads showed for this game it isn't even close
test, on, game, my big brother told me how great the game is, and he wanted me to test my ring on his game and it was epic. so I'm happy to have the game now. I hope to have a great time.
starts, with, mix, The game starts off great with a mix of classic rpg and mana bases events. Then it switches to all mana based story line that you quickly learn you cannot progress through without paying to play. You receive diamonds as a reward but they don't work as well as the ones you pay for and the support response is the rates are the same for every one. If you don't want to sink money into a game don't get sucked in by this one.

get, on, board, I played this game and found it to be rather fun and somewhat challenging, but I can't get on board with how dishonest the advertisements are. The game you folks are representing is not the game you made.
deserving, For, these, The rate of getting a SSR character is ridiculously low. For just these alone, this is deserving of a 1 star!

seen, to, knights, I've seen alot of cash grab games from summoner wars to knights chronicles to even playing marvel contest of champs. But you guys seriously take the prize. You make people pay for a weak turn based rpg with horrible story telling. Then in order to get the SSR you want it literally is 500 summons!!! Before you can get. I hope people see my review and pray they review bomb your game to a 1 star.

plaied, in, 2019, I rated the game 1 star because every time i pick up something or kill an enemy when the server saves it it'll take a long time to save even syncing takes extremely long. I plaied the game in 2019 and it still has the same problem i have a stable wifi with 20-50 ms please fix this or i might uninstall again
putting, to, it, I used to rate this game highly but, after putting more time in to it I changed my mind. They do all the manipulative garbage that other games do to get you to spend as much money as possible on this game. Do not waste your time playing this game. It will just make you want things that are nearly impossible to earn in game and make you want to waste your hard earned money on this. Play something else. There are better options than this waste of money.

sexualize, in, rpg, Don't really like how they sexualize the girls in this rpg and I downloaded this app for what the ads show, blood, gore, mystery, spent the first 4 hours playing that and nothing like the ad even has been shown
meets, in, way, game is great pokemon meets fire emblem meets gacha game in the best way possible
trying, to, f2p, Fun, but slows down after you get to level 70 if you're trying to f2p that is, the story is really good one of the things the game has to offer the other thing I really liked was it wasn't only a auto game and that you could take control and do it you self that's hard to find now, if it wasn't so grindy I would still be play, but a good game in all
did, like, game, I did like the game and enough to spend a little cash but then to find I didn't receive the products due to false advertising, I was to contact support and after some emails were exchanged, I was told it's my fault and nothing can be done, good game but avoid spending any cash.

reminds, of, blue, its fun reminds me of Pokémon red blue and yellow when it cam out in the 90's its fun

tied, to, account, No actual, real-time pvp. Very low summoning rates, the online campaign costs a lot of stamina per fight, desparately needs quality content and not just new characters. Edit: if you happen to lose the code tied to your account then your account is gone for good if you for whatever reason need to uninstall the game. There is no help from their customer service despite providing everything they asked for. I would give them 0 stars if I could.
want, on, phone, Nothing like the ads ._. I really don't want this game on my phone, is it too late to ask for a refund?

catching, in, act, An ok game but nothing like the adds, would have been fun to have a horror pixel monster catching game but the only thing you get is monster catching in act one. And let's be honest, non of the monster you can catch compair to the scantily clad girls you can get with spending money (or saving every special summon token you get). False advertising is an understatement for this game.

get, past, part, This game isn't too bad once you get past the fake monster capture part. Sad to see them resorting to such false advertising. They should just show what the game really is.

sue, for, advertising, Literally all ads for this game is completely misleading. Not a single ad shows legitimate game play. It's definitely a different game in them. I'm highly dissatisfied with the purchase. Pretty sure I could sue for false advertising.
played, to, ch5, First off i give it a 2 because it is not what the adds show, not even a little. Which was the only reason i had bought it. But that being said ive played up to ch5 and while its hard to get decent monsters from just random Unique encounters it is over all a fun game.

sued, into, existance, The ads are complete lies. Pure and utter false advertising. If this were an american company they would be sued into non existance.
getting, after, ssr, Very fun, and the gatcha is very giving I've been getting ssr after ssr and it been lovely. However the game slows down and becomes a little boring after finishing the offline story and unlocking the online story.
using, as, currencies, Ads are completely misleading and advertising other developers games. Though the game is entertaining there are many problems like using the same currencies as different currencies by adding the tag. "PAID". IMMENSE lag when it rains in different sections of the game.

see, in, ads, False advertising! This is not a creepy pokemon clone like you see in the ads. They've even edited all the pictures in the Play store to be horror themed, but it's all lies. This is your standard gacha game, complete with annoying energy systems that stop you from playing more than a few seconds without dishing out a few dollars daily. Avoid this game.
playing, for, month, Its a gatcha game, but the gatcha is disappointing. Definitely not free player friendly. Been playing for about a month, but only ever get 1 ssr char. Its quite a shame, because we get to see all this new ssr char, but the chance of actually getting them without paying is pretty slim. I'll play it for a little longer, but i think at some point i'll just delete it and play other game.

payed, to, download, Scam game. Trailer was a lie. How is it legal. Also constant advertising after payed to download.
explained, in, ad, Was expecting what was in the ad I I have played plenty of these games and beat them but was not expecting to be this.kinda disappointed it wasn't the horror game that was explained in the ad
misleading, with, ads, Good game or not stop misleading with ads
Played, for, couple, Played the game for a couple of days and it was just not fun.
talk, about, stuff, Just bad. I'm not gonna talk about the scamming stuff as you already probably know it. The story is just not worth reading. There is no balance between classes. The odds that you pull a character which is SSR(best tier in the game) are really low. The story ends quickly, and the online story is just terrible. Overall not worth your time since after a couple weeks you would probably get stuck and won't be able to make progress.
pay, for, it, Nothing like the advertisements for it in any way. This is highly illegal for a "premium" (as in having to pay money for it) game, but as the company isn't based in North America, all I can really do is be disappointed by the product and remain disgusted with the blatant scam that youtube will strongly regret advertising in less than a year.

increase, for, character, I love this game. Art style is great, gameplay is good, every player can make many build team. But please, increase rate gacha SSR for character.
catch, in, beginning, Great RPG, NOT monster catching. The monsters you catch in the very beginning are quickly out valued by the ones you summon. The story is amazing and there are weekly mini stories to complete after the main story is done. The game outside of the story is mostly idle, you come in once a day to collect the gains, place platoons for war, and complete quests, the rest of the time is spent either spending mana for stories, or collecting from the tower. Very fun, you progress quickly without much cost

Removed, like, everyone, Removed my review and just like everyone else it's another gotcha game. It's not a horror game
put, on, banner, "purchased gem only" banners are skeezy enough, but to put it on a beginner banner that goes away after a week? That's Garbage.

looking, for, game, I've been looking for a game like this for years. I havent been much of a gamer over the past 10 or 15 years with the ps2 days. This game gives me that nostalgia feeling and for only a dollar to feel that agian. pricless!

starts, as, RPG, Evertale is good, but not what the adds portray it as. It starts as a generic RPG and slowly, (and i mean slowly) become a gacha with a great story. The offline portion is good for getting characters leveled early on and getting used to the games mechanics. After the offline the story opens up to a far more compelling script and the game is relatively generis with its resources. (but not so much that it cant turn into an ocean of debt for a whale quickly) Strategy beats MOST pay to win.

did, at, time, I need help getting my account back! Someone from Support please contact me. I have emailed, go no reply after I gave my info. I bought the game, had 30 or 40 monsters, was lvl 40 or 50 up. I had did all the story at the time, now I check all servers with my google account, Nothing, It just restarts me for lvl 1. Help, cause this isnt right, I put alot of time in my guy! I did give 5* but I got to leave it 1* till I get this straightened out.

waste, on, this, False advertisements on instagram got me to buy this game, but it's not even close to what was in the ad. I feel scammed. Even if I wasn't expecting something else, this game is pretty bad, or at least it's first 10 minutes, and so underwhelming. Do not waste your money on this!!
Played, in, past, False advertising. It's not and never has been anything like the adds. It's not even remotely horror themed. Played it in the past and reinstalled it thinking it was a different game.....
connected, to, phone, Wish there was a capability to use a controller when one is connected to the phone via Bluetooth, that would really be awesome and 5 star worthy!

getting, on, track, 100% worth the dollar, fair advanced warning the ad makes it look alot like pokemon but it's more of a turn based rpg like final fantasy and in the beginning it can be very confusing but the tutorial does an okish job at getting you on the right track.
buying, after, update, I'm never buying Soulstones after Tarot card update unless I get 80%. Who would spend cash until they get 80%? I mean that is an update saying dont buy soulstones until you get the highest lol
had, in, summons, so far this game has been excellent. I've had great luck in summons tho the stone price is alittle steep. but still having a blast!
lag, in, places, I love it but it lag really bad in some places
look, like, Legend, Your ads in no way reflect what your game really is. The ads make it look like a Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy Style game but when you play it's a strange angle anime RPG monster collector game, like a Pokemon ripoff. Your ads look like an amazing game. Are those just animations that you created or is there a real product out there that have some of those elements?

takes, after, act, Nothing like the adds wich promises a much more interesting game and it takes away the open map and free feeling of the game after act 1 wich it then turns into a stage by stage experience that requires you to use energy to proceed.

m, on, chapter, Decent gameplay thus far, im on chapter 4 now and I will change my review if my opinion changes. I can already tell that the gacha is strong with this game, there's a large power difference between gacha characters and free ones. While there are quite a few cheap 1-3$ beginners packs to purchase, the vast majority of purchases are certainly not cheap per gacha roll. I like the game so far, it's not the most f2p friendly but i think I will be fine now that I got my 6 star carry.
stolen, from, games, this game is just a sad and pathetic mess their story is so bad they literally had to make fake ads to make it interesting looking so people would buy it. Secondly, 90% of the sprites and sound effects are all stolen from other games which is pure laziness and theft, not even halfway through the BEGINNING you know its a scam bacause you are not even out of the first area when the game shoves ads in your face telling you to buy their aMaZiNg deals. Scum thats all there is left to say pure Scum.

hooked, on, it, I started this game a while ago and got hooked on it. Battles were pretty engaging and story was half compelling, enough for me to stay interested. After getting to act 2, my opinion of the game dropped considerably but I still kept to it. I still had fun while I was doing it and that's what mattered. Then Chapter 10 of act 2 came, and the story kinda just ended there , and after that evertale 2.0 released, which overall just changed the vibe of the game. At this point of the game, there really isn't anything to do anymore so I got bored of it, and what's the point of doing gacha if soul stone are so rare after a while. Overall, this game is great to get you entertained for a while, but in the end, you'll just want to quit it because it gets boring. Also, the gacha rates suck.

look, like, Pokemon, Game is ok ads are very misleading the ad makes it look like a creepy old school gameboy Pokemon but its not like that at all and i wish it was the ad looks like a much better game then the actual game if its free its worth trying it but i would not pay money for this game

Fire, in, charge, Don't even bother if you think this game will be like their misleading ads. It's not. Not even close. Not even a little bit. Fire your people in charge of ads, game devs.
based, off, trailers, Do NOT download based off trailers you see in YouTube ads. The game doesn't even remotely resemble the advertisements.

shown, as, horror, This game was shown as an 8-bit horror which would've been awesome... Pokemon rip for sure..sad very sad
ask, for, what, False advertising deserves the least amount of stars that the can get. The ones who approve the ads for this game are just as stupid as any other App developer. It's no wonder why we players rather play PC/Console games that actually deliver what we ask for.
held, For, long, Honestly my expectations were blown out of the water. The game is fun, with beautiful artwork, fantastic story, and intriguing world. For a long while I thought the era of unique and fun mobile games was gone, that the true hand held rpgs of my childhood were in the past. Evertale has given me a new breath, and has opened my eyes. Honestly, 10/10
take, to, page, False advertisment. I played this game before, i wasnt going to waste me time leaving this review until i got annoyed enough every time this ad is viewed it'll automatically take me to the play store download page.. yes the only ad every time I literally could be hands free from my phone for it to take me to this page to download. Stop the fake advertising your ad is more interesting than this game. If you're false advertising then you're obviously not that proud of your product. Sorry.

sink, into, it, Story is pretty solid, it's not hard to progress if your willing to sink 15 minutes a day into it. The multi-player aspect is definitely P2W, but if you're willing to grind you'll be able to still be competitive. Only drawback is that weapons and characters are all in the same pool, so summons are really hit or miss. Other than that, this is pretty enjoyable for the casual player like myself.
mixed, with, Fantasy, Very fun, very engaging. And at a great price to play a game so enjoyable. Kind of like Pokemon mixed with Final Fantasy. Love it!
need, because, ads, This game is good people here need to stop bagging the game because of the false ads and the gacha.......think about it if you were a gaming industry and you had serious work complications because of coronavirus you'd have to cut wages and resources and well as staff and you know the fake ads produce revenue for the company. The game itself was created shortly after the coronavirus existed and slammed Japan so think about the situation... it's a great game been playing 7 months f2p so yeah...👍

waste, on, game, Don't waste your money&time on this game. No new story after 10 months, no new side events after 2.5 months, but the devs just keep releasing new SSR every 2 weeks with OP moves and recycled animations. The devs are dishonest and have no respect for the players, so don't hope for much, or just skip this trash game altogether!

Feels, like, series, Nice art style. Sprites are well done. Controls are easy. The dialogue is readable! Which is a huuuuge deal to enjoying a good rpg. It's not like pokemon, despite what some of the reviews say. Yes you can catch different "monsters", and some of them evolve. But that's where the similarities stop. (Feels more like Shin Megami Tensei series to me.) Probably spent about $25 to get a decent team. (So the gacha drop rates don't seem super absurd.) Overall, I would recommend

mention, regarding, playstyle, the ads are very graphic, not to mention completely false regarding the actual playstyle of the game. if you came here from the ads thinking you might have a decent horror mobile game, youre better off with another game entirely

showed, as, game, I was served ads that showed this game as a modern setting horror game. Deceptive advertising sucks and so do the deva
talking, about, it, False advertising and not enough people are talking about it in the top comments. It's sad it gets such a high rating when it lies

saw, for, this, False advertising at its finest! The ad I saw for this on YouTube showed it off, like another reviewer had said, as a 8 bit style horror game. After downloading the addition files and such and loading into the game I was immediately upset that I even paid a buck for this game. If it was something I'd even enjoy playing I might give it a try, but the style it's self is so far from anything I typically enjoy and the grumpy was I have from being duped means I'm uninstalling right away. 😠

thinking, in, style, This is false advertising, just another gacha game that tricks you into thinking its a horror game in the style of pokemon. For shame.
obtain, as, player, Is it too difficult to obtain SSR as a f2p player. I can't get enough of this summon rate. To be honest, I tried it again and again to get at least one SSR, but it doesn't work because the game is so selfish in terms of providing good characters.  I started playing this game in 2019, but I didn't get even one SSR, so I quit.  I tried it again in 2020 because I was still a gacha addict, but I didn't get a single SSR, and it's still the same in 2021.  So 3star for now! Still hoping XD

making, with, layout, I downloaded the game thinking it was just like the ad but it's not. Also instead of making the game with a D-pad controller layout it's a point and click. Completely false advertisement
put, into, game, I was expecting a dark pokemon experience. Their adds suggested that was the case. The 6 bucks I put into the game was a complete waste.
followed, on, twitter, I followed you guys on twitter to get the 1000 soulstones but the game keeps restarting every time i come back to it from the twitter page

shown, in, trailer, First of all. Fix your ads. Your game trailer is extremely misleading and not what the game itself presents to be at all. The only reason why I downloaded it is because of the "horror" aspects shown in the trailer. But the trailer is not even close to representing the actual game. On the other hand I did enjoy it. So I'll give it three stars.

put, into, team, awesome grain fun similar to Pokemon but being able to put other human characters into your team as well as weapons on your monsters awesome dos need a little work but it's so freaking great
left, for, movement, Great game but the controls on how you move is just down right annoying! You go one way and it darts the other! A toggle at the bottom left for movement would be great. Otherwise a great game.
advertised, in, videos, This game is not what was advertised in the videos it shows a darker version of pokemon mixed with creativity making your own monster in generic pokeballs but much darker and that's what I thought I was going to get but no some of the monster bosses I call cheating with being able to hit you 5 times in a row and even the strongest monster I have gets one shoted so this isn't the game I signed up for. Plus it cost me. 99 cents so not even a free game to play.

spent, in, game, is ok. i like the story, but lost my save and have to do again. i wish the online story mode is available without having to complete the main story first. also i spent £20 in the game and i was able to get an ok character but not great, to be honest i expected a lot more for paying that much. you should offer a choice of 3 character options for those who spent real money. its just gambling as it is now. and i wont use any more real money on it

shabby, of, game, not to shabby of a game.
played, for, time, Fantastic game lots of fun. only played for a short time so far it's amazing
paid, for, it, The initial story is great, had the classic RPG feel. Complete that and then "Act 2" amd further is no longer a free moving open map and it takes energy to progress. This energy is the same energy that everything else uses. Normally this would be fine, but you get 300 max, and everythimg costs either 27 or 50. So very little play time once the first part of the story is completed. I never would have paid for it had I known the story would eventually be restricted play time.
looking, for, what, Love the story and controls. It's just what I've been looking for. But varying abilities could make it better
Addicted, to, plot, Addicted to the plot. this is amazing 👏
put, in, mood, I like the stories and art, which put me in a mood reminiscent of the old final fantasy days. The game is fun and friendly to play. A bit catchy on the monetize area, but I guess devs have to eat too.
finished, in, days, Amazing game unfortunately super short I finished it all in 2 days. Wish there was more to it. But I absolutely love the game super addicting. Something that they could add would be the horror mystery that was shown in the ads. If they out that as a separate chapter it would make the game more fun

trust, from, them, Lying ads, how can you trust anything from them?
grind, for, characters, Not a great game, not really dark like the ads suggest and kind escalates real quick where you don't even know what's going on anymore and you need to grind lvls for your characters. And I mean warframe grind.
see, in, adds, I was expecting the horror game we all see in the adds, and I'm like hell yeah! A cheep horror game! Let's play that, but then a let down with this game. The only reason why it's not one star rn is because it has great game play and a good story line.
get, with, campaign, Fake ads for the game. This is not a horror pixel style Pokemon game. Don't waste your money. It's trash. How do companies get away with such a fake advertising campaign?!
got, in, play, It would be a nice game if it was honest about it's advertising. I thought I was getting a kind of grimdark pokemon-esk game but got something more akin to final fantasy in game play and aesthetics. I didn't pay much attention to the story as I was trying to figure out where the pokemon-esk game footage in the advertisements was in the actual game. The game works well and it has a very pretty style, but it isn't advertising itself accurately to the actual game. It's very disappointing.

spooky, like, game, The ads are ENTIRETY misleading. This is not the retro spooky Pokemon like game the vids show you. It's falsely advertised
started, because, speed, Updated i cant play this when its super laggy havent even started playing because of the slow speed
reach, to, beginning, Worse game believe when you start it's nice and all but when you reach to the beginning of chapter 1 that's when you have to pay and grind nonstop just to fill in the blanks just to fight a practice battle that's just plain ridiculous and waste of time don't try playing this game trust me on that

having, as, player, Good game so far. Gatcha elements are there, and do make it technically p2w. But I'm still having fun as a f2p player.
play, after, annoying, I'll be honest I only tried to play the game after the 200 annoying and really not suitable ads for YouTube.....no idea how ads like that are allowed on anything no response necessary 😑

played, for, hours, Blatant false advertising, the advertisements are for something else enterily even all the images above are fake. I played the game for a few hours to see if i was wrong but, nope. Bs. Ill take my review down once they remove the false advertisements
play, of, you, Bro this is the lame pay to play pay to win gambling game ever. You buy game currency and it randomly picks the amount of soul stone? This is so bad if anyone wants to play this don't it's a gimmick and trap sure it was fun- ish but common on make it free to play of you are gonna have pay to win aspects
bother, with, game, Ads are misleading, captured monsters are strictly weaker than gacha pulls. Don't bother with a game that can't advertise properly.
paid, for, game, games cool but I already paid for the game for extra things in the game
looks, like, copy, top for now, looks like 3d copy of very good 2d game ,but still like it a lot ,nothing wrong with copying good stuff and improveing it
Come, on, Devs, Come on Devs you guys are 😈 This game has adult type things and still it is under 18 Do something about it is way too much for children
happened, with, content, Tf happened with the promotional content and even the game itself? hadn't played the game since its prime ( 2 yrs ago ) and this is what happened, breh
played, since, prime, Tf happened with the promotional content and even the game itself? hadn't played the game since its prime ( 2 yrs ago ) and this is what happened, breh
makes, with, women, The ad makes it out to be pokémon but with women??? Could they be any more dehumanising??? (to clarify, catching women instead of pokémon)
got, with, models, Is nobody going to mention the fact that this game is a blatant case of false advertising? The YouTube ads make you think this is an 8 bit horror rpg, but it's got a bland story with half 2.5d models and combat that almost completely rips off every Pokémon game. Not even worth the singular dollar I paid, and honestly, I kinda want a refund after realizing this isn't what I paid for.
failing, on, section, I absolutely despise the character you start playing as. I immediately refunded this game after intensionally failing on that "hero comeback" section after the scripted loss in the destroyed village you fight the demon lady in, I'd like to imagine the main guys dying there and that makes me happy
seem, like, transactions, good fun game so far I mean I'm not thrilled with how much micro transactions are pushed since it's a paid game already but so far it dosent seem like micro transactions are needed to make it playable difficulty wise
needs, To, point, To a point very quickly with nothing left to do game needs more content
merged, with, units, Straight to the point, this game is lame due to lack of uniqueness. All the skill name just repeating and do the same thing. Ssr just merely having 2 or more same skill merged with common units. RnG in the game even worse than fgo that claim the title of hell gacha. 10 summon for 6 time just having a bunch of weapons n 2 sr character/beast cause me still stuck at the same story boss even I raised them higher than boss's level for 2 weeks. Doubt I will continue this any longer...

based, on, advertisements, Idk why they wouldn't just make a game that was PROPERLY based on their false advertisements, it looked like it'd be an amazing psychologica horror experience
following, on, Twitter, other than not being able to get my free 1000 soul shards for following on Twitter. fun game
seen, for, game, Is anyone going to point out that the ads for this game are a blatant case of false advertising? Like every ad I've seen for this game does not match actual game play at all.

download, to, eventualy, Misleading ads. if u wanna play a creepy pokemon game this isnt it . its just a regular pokemon knock off not creepy at all. If you went to go download this game after seeing its horror themed ads you'll be Severely disappointed because the actual gameplay has no horror/scary/creepy anything i even played through the first few chapters hopeing to eventualy see what was shown in the ads. Even tho actual gameplay isnt so bad In the end my time was wasted because its not the game from the ads :(

pay-, for, game, the advertisements are stolen assets from other games. Nor is there an element of visceral horror. You pay- for a strategy game which can only be beaten by solving a puzzle of mechanics preset and unchanging for that fight- the frustration makes you turn to the gacha for units- and though this isn't the answer- its VERY stacked against you for any characters you want. The side stories aren't bad- but the "open world" is very empty.

hated, because, ads, I've only played this game once and I hated it, mainly because of the ads. As a OMORI fan, the game looked like such a good mobile game, with the RPG and Psychological Horror elements, the art, it looked like the perfect game, then I tried it. And I was really disappointed, it was nothing and I mean 0% like the ads, I know there are clickbait ads but these ads in particular made me get the game in a heartbeat. Very disappointed. Just play an actual good mobile game instead of this.

played, for, awhile, exceptional game. will update after I've played for awhile.
switch, to, strategies, It's a well made game with great artwork and a good battling system. Unfortunately some of the boss battles give unfair advantages as where my heroes could not even damage the boss once which made me switch to different strategies. Some of the levels feel like there's absolutely nothing when you look at it. It's mostly trees, grass and water, I'd like to see like abandoned houses and other props that can make the game feel alive.

play, in, lifetime, you should play this game at least once in your lifetime you will enjoy it playing it
download, after, update, I love this game but after the update I can't download the content to start the game..
look, like, children, If only the characters didn't look like little children..
lied, about, content, Ads lied about the content of the game its a generic rpg story
stolen, from, creator, Advertisement was completely misleading, using footage stolen from another creator
advertised, as, what, If you're brought here by the ad on youtube, do NOT buy this game. The youtube ad is fake and the game is nowhere near what it's advertised as on there.
come, in, one, Was ok to good in the beginning If you like the story or not, but... The ad from YouTube is completely false, I thought something would come later Also in one of the pics here in the store, that monster does not evolve the far, ya can't, here is a limit And catching any of the monsters was absolutely a waste of time And implementation It's not a draw in for the game The caught monsters can't get far, some can a bit more But in no way compare to drawing special ones with gems

work, on, S21, Does not work on my Galaxy S21. The entire game is a purple screen, cannot see anything.
updated, in, store, Game say .. update required. But I am already updated in play store. WELP!
top, for, it, Can you guys increase the summon rate? The drop rate charactor is so stinggy only 0.7% and 0.716%, soul stones also hard to get/find I also top up for it too for gacha it but very very disgusting. INCREASE PLEASE. NOT ALL PEOPLE THAT HAVE LUCK!

play, through, it, Evertale you keep updating game and not only that your destroying this game new developer you add same old stuff and expect people to play through it again and again and again not only that you expect people to buy stuff on here im deleting your game not coming back because you killed the game money hungry
looking, for, what, now this is fun! it's just what I've been looking for! it reminds me of Zelda!

costs, on, Google, Paid a dollar for it so I thought it might be aa fun indie style pokemon game with waifu art. Instead it was another f2p gacha style. Turns out it only costs money on Google, it's free on apple. Tat would take it to 3stars for me. The 1star is for false advertising, as I just saw an advertisement on YouTube for this game where they made it look like a Pokemon creepypasta with almost nothing relevant to the game even being mentioned. It even started with a generic Pokemon gen 1 sprite.
take, to, 3stars, Paid a dollar for it so I thought it might be aa fun indie style pokemon game with waifu art. Instead it was another f2p gacha style.

make, for, fun, The game is good but it will be much better if you add redeem codes, something like that since this game is gacha and to make it for fun and enjoyable, anyways this game is lit!
change, for, reason, The second part of the game is horrible. Not worth the time. If they didn't change things for no reason it'd be playable.
earn, in, quest, I don't like the fact that we can only earn 30+ Jem's in clearing story quest and side missions, it's better to do the event instead of the story since you earn 40+ Jem's in clearing them
reminds, of, rpgs, although the ad was deceiving. (I thought this was undertale mobile), I'm immensely enjoying the game. it's less undertale, and more medieval pokeman/dbz Dokan battle/classic final fantasy. the story is gripping, it's gameplay reminds me of SNES rpgs like old final fantasy or chrono trigger, and even though they pull you in with... shall we say... chesty character summons.... the app is fully worth the 99 cents.
ask, for, refund, Its summoning stuff doesn't work u can't ask for a refund after less than 8hours awful game for such a over used idea with great art

feels, like, videogame, I remember when all games were 99cents, I had no problem then. and the games weren't like this, it feels like a real videogame
has, at, stars, Never played this game, only viewed the ads. Not sure why my account has it at 5 stars, but I assume that may have been my error. Unfortunately, I have to give it one star b/c the story in the ads is not in the game and false advertising is bad.
played, from, ads, I really hate how it keeps showing really cool advertisements for a game that doesn't exist and is completely separate. Would've loved to played the game from Evertale ads, but real game itself is a fairly plain app that's quickly boring.
lie, to, people, The game itself isn't bad. It's kinda pokemon-gacha styled, but not too bad. Honestly the bad review is because of the clickbait ads they use now to lie to people. I almost started playing again thinking maybe they'd added content. But nope. They just lied to get downloads. It really is a shame. To see companies get this desperate, when they have a half decent game to start. Probably would have had better actually adding content, instead of funding false advertising. Oh well.
Put, into, game, Put 30 hours into the game, got 1 SR Character....that's not even the highest rank you can get. Only download if your going to spend cash after buying. And BTW, you can't add another account if you have bad luck. Even if it's your friends email, I think they track your ip address. Only people playing this game are whales, not real gamers.

see, for, game, Every add i see for this game is a lie they cannot advertise the truth to save there lives
save, for, characters, Would be a killer game if the characters had different moves & abilities. All their moves, save for the really rare characters, r the same. U even have a time-worn but solid base to do something with: the elements. U got em, then USE 'em! Otherwise y even have the elements n there. Also, character limit break potions... Need more chances to get them. All n all, good game. Its just the attack base y i didnt give it a 5. Idk, change a name, throw n an explosion, some lightning... Something
