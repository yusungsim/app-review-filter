's, game, fun, It, I wish it ran better but I'm poor and can't afford a better phone or a good enough pc so I'm still thankful I can even play this, despite all the crashes. I just save often. It's a very fun game.
's, game, great, it, Hesitant at first to purchase the game but no regrets doing so since it's a great game and a good break from all those MMORPGs I've played, tho my major issue now is I can't enter the Abandoned Ruins #2 despite completing the "A bridge to amber island" quest already. Edit: it's supposed to be 5‚òÖ already a few weeks back but since I got busy at work and I've already deleted my "bugged" save so I have to start all over again but it's good to see the developer is very active in responding.
is, game, offline, this, Great game with tons of features, fun activities, interesting stories, and long play time hours. Because this is an offline game, we can play with our own pace, yeay! In default, we are focusing to become a great builder and run our workshop, but it doesn't limit you to focus on other things like become a friends, harvesting, fishing, ruin diving, and many more. This is one of the best game in Android, the price is so cheap compared to what you can get. Thanks developers and publisher!
is, game, first, this, I promised myself to never buy games as much as possible and this is the first game that I have purchased my whole life. I can't get enough of this. I love it so much. The only downside of this game are the occassional bugs like the automatic wayfinding sometimes doesn't work especially when riding a mount. Also, the gift giving button took too long to respond. Otherwise, game is perfect.
's, game, big, It, It's a big game, that feels empty.
am, one, only, i, Good. Enjoyable. But after 2yrs in game play, am i the only one who gets bored of it?
is, bug, terrible, this, Game itself is good, but there's a gamebreaking bug. I was getting out of the house and suddenly the game is reverted like day 1 with all the items intact. So i closed the game and the save file cant be opened. Honestly this is a terrible bug it makes you lose all your progress. It happens for the second time
's, game, refreshing, It, It's a refreshing simulation game.
's, game, intresting, It, It's very intresting game.. i like it very much .
's, reason, only, That, I am super glad I downloaded this mobile version. I was at first concerned that the controls would be noticably bad compared to the other platforms, but the controls are actually managable. Every so often I do see flickering when I move, but it's not bad enough to make me stop playing. That's really my only reason for not giving a 5th star.
is, build, key, this, Every time I assemble the stone furnace and retrieve it, it does not go to my inventory. I make sure to have lots of extra space in my inventory but still no luck. Restarted game, restarted phone, doesn't work. Can't advance at all since this is a key build for the first few quests. Super disappointed - a game you pay for should actually work.
is, game, best, this, i play almost +120 hours, this is the best game ü§©
is, game, full, it, My time is a LONG game there will easily be over 100 hours play time so the price is a steal. I played it on PC but have been commuting and needed to pass time. I am impressed it is the full game. Great game for anyone into open world like Stardew Valley. I didn't like the many of the default settings. I recommend turning down the passage of time in the options menu for the cellphone since it is a multi tasking device. I gave it 5 because I am happy it is on the phone.

is, port, great, this, Edit 2: The game is in a great state now compared to the initial launch. Most glitches are fixed and a lot more graphics options are added. Overall this is a great port, a must buy for all those who love farming simulation games (although this is more of a workshop simulation, lol)
is, game, great, This, This is great game like harvest moon, i have been played for 2weeks. Its great and very fun. Can u add some more event for 4 seasons to avoid boring doin some task? and add some more monster , legendary weapon and armor. More like mmorpg but offline mod :)
am, human, excited, I, Everytime there's an update. I am the most excited human being lolüëÄ More update!‚ù£Ô∏è
's, game, great, it, Best game ever I never played on computer or Xbox before so I can't say it's better but it's a great game
's, game, great, It, I love this game , i've played it on pc and i've finished it. Time to finish it on mobile as well XD It's a great game if you have a decent phone. Great graphics , no lag , no stutter on Poco X3 Pro . It would be nice if we could get some cheats :))) mostly money cheats
are, battle, last, you, I really love this game, even i never play on PC. But, that was some bug when you married end of winter season, exactly when you are complete the last battle, Gale will stuck inside the round table and doesn't speech to open deepest ruin, or maybe deepest ruin are not included in mobile version ? I'll make it 5 after answered or fixed
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game
is, favorite, absolute, this, I loved this game on console and out of all the games I have on my tablet and phone, this is my absolute favorite. The controls are top notch too. Thanks for this awesome port of your awesome game üôÇ
is, time, first, This, This is the first time i played the series. it reminds me of harvest moon a lot. never thought i played it in a long run. the portability of the games on smartphone even make it great i can play it anytime and load the games anywhere.
's, game, great, it, Reasonable price. Good graphic. And overall it's a really great game. 10/10
's, game, first, It, It's my first purchased game ever and it rly worth this money
's, game, purchased, It, It's my first purchased game ever and it rly worth this money
'm, fan, big, I, Because I'm a big fan of harvest moon series, so this game is a must!!!! Even i never paid for premium game before, but this game was exception, and it's worth!!, I love this game, so much freedom, no ads, no additional paying, the world and the town design was amazing!!!!! You can explore everywhere, do everything, mining, farming, crafting, fishing, and many more.. I love the vibe of this game, so calm, relaxing.. Keep up the good work dev!!! THANKS FOR MAKING MY DREAM RPG GAME COME TRUE!!!!
am, fan, massive, I, I would rate this 5 star but because it does not support controller support I feel it should only be 3, I will change if or when it does support controller. I have this on all platforms and kickstarted sandrock so I am a massive fan but I do feel let down as been waiting for mobile port since day dot and the touch detect my thumbs correctly. Please sort this out.
are, features, awesome, These, Fantastic port of a game üôÇ have this on Xbox One since day of release and now also on mobile. So far cannot fault the game, they have made it simple to play and adapted it well to Mobile with the save feature on exiting the game via menu and the map being able to put a marker down and automatically running there. These are two awesome features.
is, plant, usual, that, Amazing game so far. I was looking for a farming game that is not the usual plant and log out thing and this seems to be it, with relationships and places to explore. Love the graphics, the calm atmosphere and the multitude of details. The quests/commissions are just complex enough to hold your attention. I am only on day 5, so I can't say too much about how it progresses as a game, but so far everything is going great. Looking forward to exploring this world which promises to be intriguing.
's, game, fun, It, It's a fun game with lots of element's will post more after I've played longer
's, game, good, it, Hi I found a bug. When I finished making the Dee Dee transport and carried it to the commerce guild for the commission my game froze as soon as I entered the room. I have restarted my phone, I redid the day more than five times now but it still freezes when I enter the guild. What should I do? I'm rating this five star because it's a good game but I can't continue the game if my it keeps on freezing.
is, game, great, This, This is a great game! It's almost a perfect port from the PC version. I would note in character creation the models lips look broken. Besides that I haven't seen any other errors! Would love some more customization options though!

's, game, ported, it, I had low expectations of this, since it's a ported console game, but it blew my expectations out of the water! It's every bit as good as the console versions, and runs perfectly on my Galaxy S 20.
is, game, nice, It, It is a really nice game at first but now it keeps on freezing. I tried restarting the game and my phone as well but it is still the same. Please fix it!!! I really like this game.
is, game, great, Its, Hoping that it can maximize the fps untill 60 and the on screen control can be editable. Its is a great game and enjoyable to play.
's, game, great, it, Seems to be very light lag when I'm in the town but other than that it's a great game
's, games, good, It, It's a good ported games, but my ipega controller don't work properly, can you add custom input for controller.. Im not good on English, sorry for my bad English

's, slice, relaxing, It, I loved this game from the get go on Nintendo switch. So as you can imagine my face when I see this absolutely beautiful game in the app store üòç ü•≤ lol. It's a very relaxing slice of life game with stunning graphics and accompanied with beautiful music that really sets the tone. There really is lots to do in here from fishing, gathering, mining, crafting, upgrading, fighting and socialising with the NPC's even play rock, paper, scissors to build relationships and ultimately fall in love. Enjoy.
be, game, mobile, this, The game started off good, but as soon as I created my character, I was kicked out of the app, and I kept getting kicked out whenever I tried to continue the game. The lipstick looked smeared on the characters, and just in the character creator my battery drained quickly. I was really excited for this to be a mobile game, since I loved the Xbox and PC versions.
is, copy, 4th, This, A fantastic port of the PC version! This is my 4th copy (PC, XB1, switch and now this) and I'm thrilled with the mobile game. Especially love the new save feature for it, I'd like to see that added on my other copies tbh. Definitely worth the $. The only "downside" is it does drain my battery, but most big mobile games do, so nbd.
's, offline, playable, It, This is one of those games where you will really get your money's worth with how much gameplay and content this has. I'm surprised that apart from its simulation aspect, it also has some rpg elements like monster fighting and skill point distribution. It's easy to learn and play, although loading screens take a few seconds to load, it's not too bad. It's also playable offline so that alone makes this a great purchase for me. Looking forward to future updates! Congrats on the game release!
is, port, great, This, This is actually a great port. Controls take some getting used to if you're coming from console or PC. Love the graphics.
is, way, preferred, This, Amazing port of an amazing game! Looks and runs beautifully on mobile, and plays really well too! If you're a fan of farming RPGs (Stardew, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, Etc), definitely give this one a go. Dungeon crawling, crafting, relationships, exploration, it's all here and all wonderful. This is my preferred way to play the game and I recommend it to anyone interested in the title!
is, time, first, this, I've been playing it for almost 20 min, and this is my first time playing this game overall graphic, frame rate everything seems perfect but there's only one thing that bothers me which is when i want to log in to my gmail/google play it seems im in a loop it keep loading even i press to log in it keeps loading sooo i hope it will fix soon . And i can play it offline!!! Im sooo happy with that Totally recommend this game üëçüëå thank you ü•∫
's, game, decent, it, You can't connect to Google play games and the characters look like they have lipstick smeared all over their mouths but if you can look past that, it's a pretty decent crafting game.
