game, great, I just gotta say, great game! I love the animation style, and the whole game is very fun to play. I just wish that there was a little bit more to it, some type of progression. Something like a career mode where you can earn a currency and spend it to level up different aspects, such as the items that spawn in your house, being able to level up from two hand spots to four, a cooler that spawns that has 5 food and 5 water, an upgrade that gives you more time to collect, etc.

effect, new, It's fun add a new effect called hulusanating where if your character you use if that character catches it it will make you see stuff
problem, only, The game is what you expect to buy a family surviving the apocalypse and playing the game on your phone. What I didn't expect when I brought the game is everytime when you start your game and gather supplies it would lag pretty bad. That's only problem I had and the pretty good at that point. I still don't know if it my phone or the games problem and would like to solve it.
reviews, other, The controls are not as bad as some other reviews may suggest; you just have to get used to them. All grabable items are highlighted in white, when you approach an item to select wait for the white outline to turn green, the item will now be in your reach to grab. I hope this is useful to help others figure out how to play. I have no complaints on this game other than it does become repetitive after a while. (although there are many different endings and challenges you can make an attempt at)

movement, terrible, Absolutely terrible movement at the start. I'm moving forward but the character don't want to.

fun, Super, Super fun!!! And I love the challenges! It's great to play on car rides and whenever I have no internet. I would totally recommend this! Slightly addictive, but not that you would constantly play it. You play it whenever!
killer, Great, I love this game! Great time killer.

try, first, Let me tell you something, when I saw what was available on mobile I got it right away, I only saw this game from the YouTubers I watched, after I got it, it had so much more then what I saw a year ago, and I won like a champ on my first try and smiling at the end of the day, recommended to anyone who likes a addictive game.

objects, highlighted, Controls are Garbage. Says tap anywhere to pick up highlighted objects, so get tapping, took about 6 taps for one can of soup. You have to be facing the item almost perfectly. Don't knock anything over or you might just block your only way out of a room. Uninstalled after the first 60 seconds!

time, good, It's ok, cool and good time killer but sometimes it can be so boring. Not only that but my brother deleted the game, I've been trying to download it ever since. It's letting me review it but either I want to be allowed to play it or at least refund me. That was a good 4 dollars.

Updates, more, Excelent maybe more Updates
phase, collecting, The game is fun, however in the collecting phase at the beginning it is SUPER hard to control the movement. Most of the time I can't get him to turn so I barely end up with anything. If the controls could be fixed, it would be even more fun!
fun, Great, Great fun. Such a comedic but thought provoking game.

mode, little, Yessss! 116 days! This really shows I have no life. Anyways I died to the dumbass fridge cats >:/. But anyways that was fun. The game is good so yeah (also I was on little boy mode so the 116 days might not be as cool but shush I'm happy)
game, Amazing, Amazing game! I domt ussually grabd mary jane bc she is trash at savengimg. Download if you have to 4 bucks
mode, easiest, Hard to get through even one game on easy. It's not intuitive nor does it have any sort of manual. I love the idea but the execution needs a bit of work. The easiest mode should also allow for more time to grab items at the start. Why are family members not at all interested in getting in the bunker???

trip, long, It's ridiculous you have to pay money for this game. It's also not that good of a game. I wouldn't play it for a very long trip. ☹️
game, bad, controlls are so bad and you cant even change them just a bad game over all

version, separate, There is now another separate paid version that has been updated/reworked and expanded. Sad to see that past purchasers have been left in the atomic dust. Unless this is really cheap I would buy the new version instead so you don't miss out on anything.

bit, little, I get it - it's called 60 seconds, but it would be nice if there was a little bit longer to gather items. Or improve the controls a bit. I mean, who has a SHTF bunker and doesn't keep it at least partially stocked, so when the SHTF all they have to do is get inside?
try, first, I love the game i almost beat it on my first try but i did not even on little boy which it the easyist difficulty settings.

thing, boring, Game is not worth $4 lucky I have the game pass the concept isn't bad but the system for trying to pick up items is incredibly poorly designed. When you get into the bunker its incredibly boring the only thing you can really do is press a notebook and read a few pages maybe make a simple decision. The game is incredibly limited with very few variations to the story.

brother, little, So, My little brother purchased without asking me first. I just want to know if I can refund my money back to my google play account balance
version, atomized, I really love this game. I wish that the atomized version of this was smoother with scavenging like this version is!! It's so creative and I love playing. Although, I think that if the parents die or get captured, that you should be able to play as the kids,,,
game, good, It's a really good game but you really need to use your brain or else you'll fail
game, great, It's like the fallout of mobile and it does look like fallout love the mechanics,story,and the fact that you have to make a strategy at the start great game love it.
game, Great, Basically unplayable because of the controls in the opening scavenge section. Great game on other platforms but the controls just don't translate Save your time and try something else

lol, terrible, This game is increbile and a bunch of youtubers play it and the drawing on the day logs are terrible lol. But good graphics are incredible and has some pretty good storylines and really proves how bad i am at the game when you are getting supplies.

game, favorite, LOVE IT nothing is wrong with it its my favorite game ever! Get it get it now!!!!
luck, good, controls are difficult, should be cheaper to buy the game, gets a little boring, do recommend if your the kind of game simple but exciting person.you have to be smart to beat the game, install it and good luck!
retake, nice, A nice retake of the Oregon Trail classic game. I didn't enjoy the graphics much.

game, great, This is a great game! I would 100% recommend it, Lots of ways to play the Game with challenges, survival Scavenging and full on apocalypse! The Easy, normal and hard modes are also pretty balanced! Cons: Sometimes movement in the house can be glitchy makeing it slightly hard to get stuff, Costs money (but I personally think its worth it) I could go on about this game but ill leave you with this,

game, cool, Pretty cool game. A lot of endings. Although, it takes brain. You really must think through your choices, it's not just random. The game is unpredictable most of the time but that's what makes it fun, wondering would could happen next! You really gotta think about who you're gonna send out and think about endings! Honestly, it is not an easy game. It's actually quite hard. I think my only complaint really is the entertainment I get out of it. It does get boring , sometimes I fail after I get really far and then try again and again. After so many tries, the game can get *so* boring, a lot of reading has to be done too. I'm fully aware that this game Is *not* new, yet , I don't think it's changed much.

page, main, Theres a bug that i cant play on the main page it froze and it keeps doing that and i can play if you fix the bug i give 5 stars thank you
medkit, other, I would give this game 5 stars if they make it where the movement is easier, and they make it so you can have more than one thing like 2 medkits! That would be nice, but you have to get the other medkit from exploring. Then this game will have 5 stars.
rm16, paying, The fact that your paying rm16 for this game is ridiculous , everything is basically same as pc version , great game but movement controls for scavenging is sosososo bad 😶 fix the movement issue and it'll be fine

trash, complete, I want to love this game but the scavenger controls are complete trash. You get stuck on mundane things around your house scavenging. Remove the crashing into lamps and everything in the house which block off sectors once the shotty controls bump you into them.

potential, good, The game has really good potential...but the controls in the beginning when you have to run and collect food are so hard to use...many times I'm not able to move my character around...or they move too much. The game is also incredibly hard to play on apocalypse mode. Even on easy...i have never "won". I have done 10 play through and not a single time did I make it past 50 days without dying from something. I'd really like to continue playing...it has good promise, but I will prob stop soon

app, amazing, Hey it's an amazing app! But I want to refund it cus I uninstalled it but I can't refund. Its not showing the button to . So help :]
control, Poor, Poor control, plus I don't care to read a storyline in a game guess this is why I play survival games that needs no story or what's happening give me a vile of hp and thirst and sickness and leave it at that
actions, more, It's good to play but I think you nee more actions and a maybe a bed item cause I get confused when it says I'm tired but over all an enjoyable game to play and I would recomend

😍, Amazing, Amazing 😍 But... The challenges are really hard. But when you complete them you earn hats and other stuff. And it shows you what you have to get before you start. And it also shows you who the decorations are for if you look at the bottom

game, good, Was a good game but now won't let me start it up
hours, few, Fun for a few hours then becomes repetitive
game, great, It's a great game on PC but on mobile the beginning 60 seconds of a game needs such precise movement sometimes that it's very difficult to get a good run on mobile, wouldn't recommend on mobile but on PC 100% fine and 5 outta 5 game

stuff, other, Really hard to control on cell phone. Tried to download it for my desktop, but there is other game stuff you have to have before you can actually get the game. Would not recommend to play on cell.
game, funny, It's a funny game I just wish you had a little more time

challenge, deadly, Ok i have to say....its pretty good...i did the 7 deadly sins challenge and it made it even more fun
drill, real, I love this game it shows you how to act in a real drill and it's only 4 dollars I love it.
times, first, Fun for like the first 3 times...Then..... I'm back in the play store looking...
game, Cool, Cool game
charge, unauthorized, I had an unauthorized charge for this game, came to found out it was my brother. I contacted you guys multiple times for a refund but never got a response. Now you guys have forced me to contact google support. These people steal your money even if you didnt buy it.

chunk, good, The control scheme is terrible. Sensitivity is extremely high in the rotation of movement and the walking makes it difficult to use the screen to see what and where items are located throughout the house. You use the left have of the screen to move, which your hand would cover a good chunk of the screen and it's the same with the rotation used on the right side. Definitely not worth having on a portable device.

game, Good, Good game but not for me.
part, beginning, The beginning part where you're in the house and collecting stuff is pretty unplayable. I tried to play it, I really did, but I could not navigate with the way the collision system works. I got stuck on practically every obstacle.
game, Interesting, Interesting game, but something is missing from it. I can't place what it is. It was fun while it lasted but it didn't keep my attention long.
control, Worst, Worst control ever!
people, other, I've seen other people play this game and it's very fun

game, good, good game
game, good, It's a good game but just not the game for me 🙂 I still rate it 4 stars
lots, detailed, Very detailed, lots to explore, you won't get bored playing this game
rating, real, I really love the game but this isn't a real rating this is just a note to the developers can you please make 60 parasec to be free because I really like the game
stuff, hard, I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ it is so good because it is challenging you and I love hard stuff plus u can put it on easy and normal I totally think u should buy this plus it is cheap ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍😘😘😘😝😝😝☺️☺️☺️
game, good, It is a good game but here and there it will lag and the countdown with sometimes glitch. Other than that it is a awesome game!

thing, same, I love the idea of the game it's the same thing as real life
life, real, I love the idea of the game it's the same thing as real life
game, fun, It's a really fun game
arrow, forward, It's... OK and has promise, but it's a bit too clunky and you don't really do much, quite a lot of just clicking on the forward arrow.
screen, black, game keeps going to a black screen plz fix
controls, bad, bad controls in the start
game, Great, Great game but when you play on phone it's hard😄
game, second, Good, but not as good as the second game. Controls are messy, especially in the collection phase, and every run is practically the same, with the same random events occurring in the same order most of the time.

lagging, little, This game is so fun and interesting I would definitely recommend this game.one problem though is the controls to move throughout the house is a little lagging and to grab stuff is very hard
game, good, Very good game the reason I give it 3 stars is when u start and u have to grab iteams to survive it's terribly hard to control but the game is fun. I got bored a bit after 3 games so maybe make it a bit funner
game, great, May I please have a refund(second time asking) I really want a refund please. Eny ways great game I want to refund it because I don't wanna play eny more
game, good, It's a good game, and that's all the good things I have to say for it. The controls are terrible and the selection process are worse than not intuitive, they hardly work at all. With time and effort it can be learned, but rather than doing that Id recommend just getting it on a different platform instead.

game, great, Game is really nice to play. Haven't been seeing any updates to this game in terms of scenarios. I played for quite a bit, and now it's just getting a bit boring for me, personally. Still a great game.
game, good, Im sure the controls are like that to be funny and challnging but i just cant help but think that its less worthy of the title good game becaus of the controls but itz an okay game if u forget the ussles one dolores u can get all items with some faness and skill

game, great, Overall just a great game survive until you get rescued
game, Great, Great game love it
place, different, Not optimized for non-16:9 screens. Controls are a nightmare. You tap on joystick and it appears in absolutely different place, away from your finger, which makes it impossible to play the game.
apocalypse, nuclear, Controls are god awful, want a good nuclear apocalypse game? Get sheltered, so much better than this piece of garbage on phone. Edit- I did, the controls and horrid and the overall game gets boring after a while.

endings, new, I love the game but here I have some new endings avatar ending if you don't get the scientist ending and your at the last stage you get a robot from them and if you fix the robot enough it will save you the the Santa ending is if you help Santa prepare for chromas hell save you

game, Amazing, Amazing game I just have 1 concern when I am walking to grab materials it makes me move very weirdly I shake sometimes I am not sure if this is part of the game but it's kind of annoying but other than that it's great would recommend!
button, separate, You should just be able to touch the screen where you want your character to go, not this separate walk button and separate directional button stuff. The technology is there to be more user friendly. DON'T pay for this game unless they unless they have a 60 seconds lite to see if it's right for you. I used my play pass.

game, best, The best game ever it takes skill and strategy
vibe, horrible, Fun game, has a horrible histories type vibe to it with the art style and humour. Scavenge can be kinda clunky but it's a part of the challenge I guess, enjoyed though, would recommend.
fill, good, I love this game so much it is a good game fill with challenges and I love it
game, best, Really the best game I ever played! (Not a fake review) tbh I would play this until I die!

jane, mutant, Its GREAT! But.. mutant Mary jane was starving so I fed her. But then it said "Mary jane has left the bunker because of starvation"
game, amazing, This is an amazing game!
game, decent, It's a pretty decent game. But if you can add external devices like a keyboard that would be better. Just wondering if you can add this feature

game, Best, Best game ever! I LITTERLY WAS SO ADDICTED I ACTTED LIKE I HAD 60 SECONDS TO DO EVERYTHING AND HAD A DREAM I HAD 60 SECONDS TO COLLECT SUPPLIES BEFORE A TKRNADO CAME! Ik its a tornado and not a nuke, BUT STILL CLOSE! Worth the money and i would pay 50$ for the game!
people, most, Now this game is about a situation most people don't know about by gives you a good view, and there lots of challenges and you can make up your own! And you can play it without WiFi which I have a problem finding. But anyway this is a good game and would recommend! :)

timer, Second, Amazing! I love the 60 Seconds, especially on how the game is played. One thing I wish was changed however is the way to move the player when the 60 Second timer starts, It's a little annoying when you move the opposite direction when you go a certain way. Other than that, 10/10.

games, first, Could be better. Consumes a ton of time. It was fun the first few games but if you get the pattern, it becomes so boring. It's either too hard or too easy. No in between. Not a waste of cash but I couldn't say it's worth it either. Not a bad game, not too good either. Just... Meh.

poggers, pretty, Play pass review: its pretty poggers i must say, reding gets boring though. But its a price to pay; pther then that the game is prwtty well made. Maybe update the scavenging controls though, its hard to control for new players. :)

items, non, Pretty bad but kind of good because you can barely move the screen around the walking barely works and it's not even 60 seconds it should be called 30 seconds because of how fast the timer is I wish you could have non useful items because I would just grab whatever I can grab but I would get the end because I didn't grab anything Important fix these thing and it will be a higher review

fakat, Oyun, Oyun güzel fakat Türkçe dil desteği olsa güzel olur Bu oyunun Türkçesi var mı varsa APK olarak mı iniyor?
game, cool, It's a pretty cool game but it's pretty long and after a while it gets boring. Also the controls aren't very easy to use.
way, same, I wish I could go scavenge for supplies the same way I scavenge in the house. The game has potential but unfortunatly the way it is right now is difficult to really enjoy.
fun!!!!i, much, This game is hard you realy need to know how and if you don't it will be kinda hard. But this game is soooo much fun!!!!i really dont think u should have to pay to play but yea it is very fun hope that helps u...

downside, only, Well this gameplay is a 5 star, the only downside is that the controls are terrible i hate the controls so much. Also sometimes I cant collect stuff because it lags sometimes. But overall its a good game!

game, best, The best game I have ever played! I hope there is a sequel to this game! I really didn't notice anything but a tiny bit of lag. I just ignored it and kept playing. I really like apocalypse since its like a challenge to test you.

game, Weird, Reading. No movement. Weird ass game
couple, first, Worth the effort. I played the first couple of scenarios (i.e. the drill, etc) and was just about to uninstall, thinking this game wasn't quite for me.. and then I skipped to the 4th and last scenario which was just "Survival"... and I'm glad I did because it turns out I just wasnt a fan of the "Scavenge" scenario (yet). The game has great replayability, solid music, and pleasant sense of humor. I'll be playing this game for some time to come now. :)

stuff, important, Loved the game. Just the game was glitched and said "The end" every time I got to the shelter. I get that if you don't gather important stuff you loose. But I gathered everything but the lock and I still got the "The End"
️, worth, My payment to download this game is so worth it, this game is so fun and you will never be bored and when I start playing this game there is no bugs bothering me until now, I recommend you guys to download this game your payment will be so worth it.♥️

👌, Great, Great game 👍 👌 👍
game, ok, It is an ok game but will not let me refund it on Google play
fun, much, This game is so much fun I saw one of my Youtuber play it so I want I got it was hard but really fun
game, whole, Lots of potential, need an option of upping the 60 sec clock, also it would be great if you got chances to go back and scavenge for another 30 secs when you send someone up?? I think each family member should count as one item. Unless I'm missing something the whole game is based on choices in a diary. You cant interact with anything in the shelter.
minutes, few, I SAW BLACK KILL TRUST ME BUT IT DARK GREEN KILL TRUST ME BUT IT DARK GREEN KILL TRUST ME BUT IT DARK GREEN KILL TRUST ME BUT IT DARK GREEN KILL TRUST ME BUT I THINK THE GAME is a bit unfair i want to see your house inside and in the sims mobile how do we talk manager can i talk to you in a few minutes now because iv got the best idea ever so hard i will set you free prizoners if you are doing a great day plz trust me a chance and in bed with the park is a big lie popup9 and i will follow you ba

controls, stiff, I thought this was the game I saw all those years ago and it's still just as clunky. I guess it's part of the gameplay but the stiff and awkward controls kill this for me, plus the fact that family members can't take themselves to the shelter. Are they crippled? Handicapped? Just plain stupid probably, regardless of their intelligence level they should be able to bring themselves to a damn hole in the floor. So, the controls & lack of family ability to walk are what made me uninstall.😞🖕🏾🚬

thing, few, their is a few thing that show that they tried to make people injoy the game but the cost makes some people have to turn away from getting the game because they don't have money but the game is End of the world survival 💯 % but, the beginning they should make like a uninspired launch of a dangerous wepon and when you first play the nuclear bomb launch should be on TV 📺, he gets up and then goes in the start passion and then it goes to the start of that game. Over all it is a good game.

game, Awesome, Awesome game despite the cost I saw one of my favorite youtubers play it and wanted to try it myself it's a great game that can keep you entertained for a while, except the controls at the beginning to gather items are hard on PC. Otherwise great game and I love it!

game, great, It's cool but I'd rather you play on PC because like it's very bad cuz like the controls are very bad and it's just it's just messes you up still great game but it's just a controls
game, amazing, It is a 5 star game but I rated 4 stars because I can only get one game out of it before it freezes on the home screen. It might just be my phone, but it could also be a bug. Other than that it is an amazing game and it is so much fun!! 10/10 would recommend

game, good, It's a good game but the controls are weird feeling and when I unstalled the game it wouldn't give my money back
feeling, weird, It's a good game but the controls are weird feeling and when I unstalled the game it wouldn't give my money back
game, worst, Its probably the worst game you could ever spend money on its a total rip off dont make my mistake take my word for it.
rip, total, Its probably the worst game you could ever spend money on its a total rip off dont make my mistake take my word for it.
game, offline, 60 seconds is a good offline game you have to figure out what to do and to grab and survive the Wasteland on expeditions
game, okay, Its an okay game, but its kinda hard to move around on mobile.
updates, more, Game is very good. Needs more updates.
glass, little, HEY DEVELOPERS! Please edit the image of the water bottle into a much bigger one. So that a glass turns into a bottle, you know what I'm saying? Otherwise it's too unrealistic, no one can survive 4 days without water after they just had 1 little glass. Soup is good. Water is too small. I'm only talking about the look of them, not game mechanics.
game, different, I don't like the game as much as I thought .I can't unreregister the game anymore and I really want to get a different game so can u let me unregister ☹️
game, whole, Whenever i got in the bunker it would kick me out of the whole game
complaint, Only, Amazing. Only complaint is that when you are scavenging for things its super hard to collect them because walking is hard.
game, good, Its a good game
mins, straight, Doesn't even work. I paid for this and it was stuck on a picture for 10 mins straight. Don't get this app it's a waste of money. I just bought a picture. Edit: I reinstalled this game multiple times. it will sit on the soup can screen forever. I never even got to play the game. This game should be fixed immediately, or taken down.

setting, apocalyptic, I didn't enjoy this game as much as 60 parsecs. In the beginning when you're running around the controls feel really awkward and aren't really optimised for touchscreen gameplay. I know it's supposed to feel a little clumsy but it's crossed the threshold of goofy and entered frustrating. The apocalyptic setting also crossed the line of dark humour a little. All in all a little bit worse than 60 Parsecs, which is a shame because I really enjoyed that.

things, same, The game is fun but gets boring after reading the same things over and over. I don't see why you have to pay for the game when it is just a story/bunker survival game. I won't hate on the game because it is entertaining but I just dont get the point in having to pay for it other than the creators wanting to make a quick buck.

game, Amazing, Amazing game with great throwback feels. It reminds me of Fallout a LOT. The only things I think don't work very well are how weird the controls are and respond, and during the scavenge section, the other family members are completely brain-dead.

game, best, The best clicker game
youtuber, huge, This game is awsome it realy gets youre adrenaline up and pumping and huge youtuber play it like gloom,cubscputs,and more
youtuber, favourite, It used to be fun but now i cant even get on the game. Itll show the loading screen but it kicks me off. Ive had the game for a couple months though and its really fun even though ive never had an ending. I downloaded it because my favourite youtuber KubzScouts played it and i really wanted to try it. I would have given 5 stars if it still worked
time, first, The game is fun the first time you play but them gets really boring as you are.doing all of the same.things over and over again
game, ok, Its an ok game, but its a pain to actually start good. If you want to get good equipment you can't hold much of it, plus your family is required. You also can't play the game unless everyone gets into the bunker (from personal experience when i last played). The controls are also super finicky. You can be holding forward on the "joystick" thingy but you'll barely move at all. Plus you can be right next to the biggest item and it be impossible for you to grab it. There's no grab button, just pres

animations, small, Boring, has potential but all your doing is reading ... the characters dont even move or have small animations when sending them out or equipping them.. Just alot of reading ,it gets old after 1 game I wish I never wasted the money lol
part, first, Fun game for about an hour than gets boring the first part is so hard to control making it impossible for mobile gamers to quickly get good items . NOT worth the three pounds I payed

So I assumed it didnt purchase so tried again and got an error saying I already owned the game. Still charged twice for it. Edited 9/20/20. Second charge was automatically cancelled and I am now able to download the game. Still dont know what happened.

way, fun, I love this game it's dark but in a fun way I've played this game like a million times and I still love it to this day my only complaint is that getting what you need in the beginning is super hard to do because you have to face what you're trying to pick up which is hard cuz it's really wonky but overall great game 10/10

idea, Good, Good idea, but the movement and ability to grab things is atrocious.
start, damn, Its been showing this damn start screen with the cann for like 10 minutes i cant do anything very disapointing
pressure, more, The game is great. I love having a time limit it puts more pressure on me. But the thing I dislike is when you get stuck one an object. Then it takes away more time to get off. Or haveing and two objects blocking the door way. But over all the game is amazing!

iffy, little, A little iffy. The mobile contols are hard when your collecting stuff, but it would be nice if you added in controls for a touchscreen chromebook that works on the keyboard. Thank you!

gameplay, more, It gets kinda boring for a game the is 3.99 their should be a little more gameplay and it gets really glitchy not all the time butt some times. I mean I'll recomend to play it but not spend 4 dollars on it
fun, super, This is super fun and it was worth the money!
challenges, more, Pretty good. You get more challenges on computer but pay more. You lose nothing from the basic gameplay which is so nice. Definetly worth it.

stage, first, I like the game and the concept. I downloaded it on my chromebook, got past the first stage of training and it wouldnt go to the next screen or let me go back. Please fix it, it has potential.

games, favorite, Very fun, simple to use, one of my favorite games to watch and play.
reason, main, I saw lots of YouTubers playing it and was immediately excited when I found I could download it but it costs money which is the main reason I gave a lowered rating also the game gets boring fast

game, good, OK game bit annoying that you have to scroll down to read the pages but good game
game, best, It's the best game and it was 1 of the games I wanted and I have it thanks for making the game
idea, Good, Good idea but not well executed. Controls and screen freeze/lag badly and regularly have to sign into Google account which is all very annoying. Very quick learning curve which is great and graphics are nice. Only played classic apocalypse but majority of the game was reading out of a notebook and didn't have opportunities to leave to scavenge. Lost interest in reading the somewhat repetitive notebook around day 5 and only hung in hoping I would be able to do something else. Alas no.

time, great, I love it! Can be a little boring but I love it!! It is a great time passer! You should Definitely get it!
game, amazing, I love it its an amazing game!
game, brilliant, Possibly a brilliant game. It could be so much better than what it is... if the controls were actually workable!
tho, challenging, Not too bad very challenging tho I guess it worth the money
side, left, The controls are on the left side of the screen and way too difficult to maneuver! Would be fun if you could just control him on the screen like every other game. Glad I did not purchase this!

game, OK, It's an OK game it gets boring for me but I'm sure if you give it a try you would love it.
game, damn, The controls for the gathering portion are still so bad after all this time, Im gonna go ahead and never play again even though i bought the damn game. Not worth your money or time, buy a tootsie roll instead.
waste, Terrible, Terrible waste of money i cant even refund and get my money back literal trash DONT BUY

game, fun, Very fun game, well made and very funny with lots of diffrent situations and challenges. Only thing I would like to see is more interactive play like in the first 60 seconds for the scavenging, maybe when one of your characters goes exploring you could play as them? Maybe narration aswell, I don't mind reading but I was playing for an hour yesterday and can get a bit cloying having to read to play. Other than that fantastic highly recommend.

games, post, Extremely fun! I've watched numerous YouTubers play this game and thought to try it out for myself. It's very smooth, the controls are easy to understand and you only need them for 60 seconds of the game anyway. 😂 You basically have 60 seconds to scavenge materials from your house and then survive as long as possible with your resources. It's great if you're into survival and fallout/post-apocalyptic games.

game, Boring, Boring game the the Scavenging part at the beginning of the game is horribly done can't get nothing can't get out of the rooms I always get blocked by things n that's the only fun part the rest is reading maybe kuz I've played this war of mine it instantly pops up in my mind and is done better

😢, Iplus, Love the game but it doesn't work on my Iplus 8 😢
challenges, more, So the 60 seconds part kinda sucks but after doing the challenges you get used to it. It isn't that bad after you do the 60 seconds like 20 times. I love the game play and again the challenges. I would like to see more challenges in the future though. Great game

one, second, So fun and addicting! Can't wait to get the second one!
game, fun, It's a fun game, but getting what you need fast is impossible! You can literally be right in front of the item/items you need and something a few feet away will light up green. Also if you're not in a "perfect" spot or angle it won't let you grab it. The challenges are next to impossible for that reason, over all the regular part of the game is fun, but you need to make it easier to grab items, rather than them having to be lit up as green!!

time, whole, Love the gameplay just wish you could add something else for when theyre tired instead of the medkit sothat we can use it when needed And maybe if we could control our characters expiditions like let them walk and stuff becuase its a little boring having to just push buttons the whole time
👌, good, This game is hard on phone but fun have good luck👌🏾👋🏾.......
items, dropping, Doesn't work right, items don't want to pick up, sometimes the game doesn't think you're in the safezone despite dropping items, items don't always make it to the shelter, and sometimes even people. Trash game that needs fixing, tried 10 time and didn't even make it to the actual survival aspect because of issues in the first part.

game, great, great game. fun at first then when you get all the endings not as fun
reasons, tipical, I like this game very much for some tipical reasons.You can end your game in alot opportunities, many games dont typicaly have these and so makes the game even boring.There is alot of choices you can do in this game .I suggest if you are looking for a game to play it has to be 60 seconds.You can even watch various videos made on this game like Kubz Scouts and many more!

game, Best, Best game ever
challenges, great, I play this game on iPad. This game has great challenges and all that stuff. I absolutely love this game. Can't describe how much I do. A thing you could add though, is a cup once some of the water is used. I understand that probably don't bring cups into the shelter, but if they could, that would be great. Another thing they could do is bring blankets. That would make them more comfortable if you think of this as a real life situation. But in total this game is GREAT. Thanks.

atmosphere, better, Seems.kind of boring, tho i bought the space one aswell and rate it 5 stars. It just has a better atmosphere.
food, best, I love it when i run my best food and water is four and supplies are good and I have tablet, I love when I'm running and... in the shelter to but I only have one thing to say:thar should be a push button like Timmys toys are in the way and you have 10 seconds left,but it take 2-4 seconds to push it out of your path But I hope this game gets better and better.

modes, many, It worth the money it goves many difrent modes to play ranging from chalinges to actule game play i soggest if you can get it
screen, first, I bought this game and I opened it and it was stuck on the first screen so I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it and now I have to pay for it again
concept, Interesting, Interesting concept but the controls are terrible! A lot of the time is spent backing up and getting to get in the right position to grab and drop off an item. Immediately uninstalled.

game, good, I honestly hate this as an app and would like a refund for it. The controls are absolutely terrible even on easy. Besides that it would actually be a good game but considering you have to rely on the controls to gather stuff, it completely takes the fun out of it.
shelter, actual, I think it could be really fun but I cant figure out the controls once I'm in the actual shelter. Maybe I'm dumb..that's possible. But other than reading the manual, I have NOTHING to do. Am I not waiting long enough for something to happen? AM I dumb? Is there instructions that tell u how to do things?
game, good, The controls ar AWFUL really Awful I HATE T he controls Omg- I made this in 2018 it's actually a good game I play it on laptop now!
Game, terrible, A terrible Game! I want a refund
game, ok, I played and i got bored in an hour and tried to refund it but i couldnt overall its an ok game so can i please get a full refund
refund, full, I played and i got bored in an hour and tried to refund it but i couldnt overall its an ok game so can i please get a full refund
bit, little, I've always wanted to play it and when I did it wasn't what I really expected but I used to watch Markiplier play it. The controls can use a little bit of work in the start of the game.
game, good, Its a good game but its glitchy and difficult for the frist part but it's a fun game

war, nuclear, Very fun and entertaining, also it makes you think of the things people would go through in a nuclear war, I find this game very entertaining.
taps, many, The controls are awful! It takes so many taps to pick up items and to select rations that the game is super frustrating. I enjoy the gameplay for the most part but during the scavenging part the lack of response grabbing things makes the game near unplayable in my opinion.

kit, med, I love this game so much even though I'm horrible at the game but I love the graphics and Timmy's the best at getting supplies he'll get you a med kit when you don't have one and he'll get you a gase mask when you don't have one to wow he's very amazing and when you do apocalypse and get Mary Jane because sometimes she doesn't break the gase mask and she might get you a med kit but Timmy is kinda mean because he will need the medkit after he gets it but before you send someone out feed them

fun, much, 60 seconds is so much fun you can get all the supplies you need yourself or you can survive with a already packed bunker and try to survive you can send people outside to get more water food and other supplies it is so much fun I really recommend this game for anyone.

gameplay, Amazing, Amazing gameplay i love this
minutes, few, I bought it an hour ago but it keeps saying your order is processing it will be done in a few minutes ITS BEEN AN HOUR!
killer, true, It's okay...I appreciate where the developers were going, but sadly I just never felt fully gripped. The experience is very repetitive and doesn't really suffice as a true time-killer due to the lack of actual gripping gameplay or narrative.

games, best, Hi I'm Heather and this is one of the best games on mobile I have have ever played check it out totally worth it
lot, whole, I actually prefer this to the PC version, because the start gathering phase controls are odd. The whole reading the story thing is kinda boring, but it makes it a whole lot easier and cheap to make.

thing, only, Amazing the only thing that would make it better is if you could sometimes control the people that are scavenging
game, good, It is a pretty good game I only got this because of Kubz Scouts if you know who that is but the touch sensitivity can be better and add more endings etc and I would give 5 stars but overall good game.

game, Amazing, I've been watching Kubz Scouts play for years! Amazing game and I like that you can apply different strategies and how real life mechanics are set in place. (Water every 5 days, on the sixth you die. Food every 9 days on the tenth day you may die depending on the level) it's an awesome game and I would recommend! Samsung Galaxy J3 luna pro Edit: Ive switched phones and it works just as great on Galaxy S10+ and my boyfriend has it on his Iphone 11 pro max and it works great for him too.

game, Great, Great game but me and many others, from YouTube, would love to have a multiplayer mode, during this mode it would be Tsar Bomb automatically. You would have to pick your character and the game could randomly decide whether Ted or Dolores are in charge of the food. Mary-Jane and Timmy could help collect stuff when first gathering equipment but only have two slots and as Mary-Jane is larger she could walk slower. During the time your character is out scavenging each day they could be out looking.

game, fun, Hard to play. It is very hard to scavenge around. I thought it was going to be a lot more like the PC version, but it's not. It's a fun game, but is just hard to use. I wouldn't recommend it for mobile use.

game, great, Really great and interesting game, I really enjoy survival games that use resource management as one of the core mechanics and this game nailed it. Only complaint is the controls in the beginning stage when you scavenge for resources is very wonky. You turn, then walk, then turn, then walk, all the while you are trying to move past everything you have accidentally knocked over. I hope the creators continue with this ambition though. Great game, despite the crappy controls.

game, good, A good game with a frustrating port. While the day-to-day bunker gameplay works fine, the 60 second scavanging run is horrible on tablet. The performance of this 3D section is pretty bad, and there are no graphical settings. The touch controlls don't work very well, using an unreliable virtual joystick. This results in a big disadvantage, compared with the pc version. You would need 10 additional seconds to collect the same amount. You restart that section 10-20 times to get decent items.

title, Incredible, Incredible title. A unique concept, cool artstyle, and fun gameplay make this a perfect buy, especially considering it's cheap pricetag. The gameplay is addicting and challenging: it offers a perfect blend between skill and RNG. Admittedly, the gameplay can become quite stale after a while, but as long as you set goals to motivate yourself, that shouldn't happen for a very long time. I Highly recommend this game!
