noticed, in, X, I noticed in PA-X, on the last mid-spin tile in the level, that the wrong texture was used or at least shown to where it showed a U-turn tile instead.

sucks, without, paper, Yay options time but still detection system sucks without paper (and I meant that literally)
Play, on, tho, Play it on pc tho
challenging, at, levels, Game is simple but challenging at later levels. Truly a great game
got, for, phone, Game is super cool but the only reason why I got it for my phone was so I could play level 10 but you cant play it before beating level 8 & 9 which is super stupid because it isn't like that on pc either. Never played level 9 before and it is super hard. You should change it so that a player can choose which level they want to play regardless of the other levels. This is stupid
lovable, for, me, I am good at rythm games, this is a great rythm game, but it is also harder then other rythm games I've played. Thats what makes this game lovable for me :) I recommend you to get it
have, on, PC, Great game, have it on PC and wanted it here, sadly you can't play the last extra world, World XT, or "options" as I like to call it. Can't wait to have the muse dash songs here though!
getting, to, part, Cool game but the inability to practice certain sections made me refund it. I spent way too long getting to one part of a song before dying to it again and again learning nothing. Just because you have a cool looking rythm game doesn't mean you can omit features every other rythm game has.

play, at, %, Great game, but burns my battery way too fast. Can't play more than 15-20 minutes even at 100%
love, on, phone, I love this game on the phone and on the computer. I just hope you are able to release a custom level/level editor on the phone version.
gets, with, levels, Probably the most simplistic idea for a rhythm game imaginable, and yet it manages to still maintain so much content because of how difficult it gets with later levels. Definitely my favorite rhythm game of all time. After buying this version, I ended up getting the steam version as well for $6, and that one has the option of creating your own levels; or playing some of the 10,000s of online levels. The PC version is far better control wise, but mobile is still very much playable.

Works, on, phone, Tried the web demo (first 3 levels) and really liked it. This full version has many interesting rhythms and catchy songs. Works well on my phone, and even works fine on my potato Chromebook after turning off special effects.

changing, to, everytime, Good game but it really needs an update since the game doesn't save your settings. It's annoying changing the resolution to 70 everytime I open the game.
link, with, acc, Can i link with my steam acc?
add, in, settings, please add fps options in the settings. The input lag is terrible and it makes the game annoyingly hard to play. Calibration in the settings doesn't really match with the gameplay. Maybe I expected too much from it.. it's very different compared to the Steam version.

get, for, fire, This game was amazingly fun! The extra worlds are really good, I found some great songs with this, it's worth the money! The more worlds you complete, the more colors you get for your fire and ice :)
enjoyed, for, people, The more level there is, the more I realize that I'm bad at rhytm.. Superb song though and I think it's a bit easier, like the error margin is more tolerant than it used to be, so I think it can be enjoyed better for people like me XD
tapping, on, screen, Pushing buttons > tapping on flat screen
see, over, store, Really good game No ads, fun, better than 90% of all games in the Google play store. Can't wait to see knockoffs of the game all over the store!
TAP, TO, RYTHEM, YOU TAP TO THE RYTHEM BUT THE RYTHEM IS A MINIGUN.
songs, on, mobile, Good game, but no custom songs on mobile. Only on PC Steam :(
work, on, mobile, Love the idea of this game but doesn't seem to work on mobile. I can calibrate fine but after about 80% of the first level it just stops registering my inputs and I lose on the simple section. Unless I can find a fix soon I will have to refund

downloaded, on, 8th, Hey, i downloaded this on the 8th and its been not working since. I waited all of this time because i was not sure what to do Then i decided to try to get a refund This simalar thing happened with another game i bought and downloaded the game was called hiveswap and i waited a clouple weeks thinking that it needed time to render that i bought it and downloaded it. And it worked. Thats what i thought the same rules applied with this game and i guess not. The thing is, i want a refund if possible.

have, with, it, Everything about the game is great; controls, visuals, and of course the music. Only issue i have with it is the calibration. It constantly goes from around 250 to 300 ms at seemingly random. It also seems to break most of the time when checkpoints are used, bringing the song offbeat and offtiming things, making worlds like XO and XT more difficult than needed.

dive, to, this, I need to dive right in to this, in a compliment sandwich. With extra bread. This game is really smooth. I downloaded it on mobile and it is worth the money.Though, adding a level editor would be nice. I love the simple, easy to understand plot. It basically has you as god, controlling two planets in the rhythm of a song. And if you're broke, you can just go on your web browser and search up the best game, A Dance of Fire and Ice, and click on the itch.io build since Steam costs money.

takes, for, one, I love rhythm games but I think this takes it for a phone one
spooking, in, game, Insanely great music, awesome gameplay, everything I wa spooking for in a rhythm game, sadly it's super short, but the time challenges are nice
play, on, mobile, Very great game, but obviously I can't play any customs on mobile, so it would have been nice to see a bit more content available after acing the game. It is nice to be able to practice while I'm on a trip however, and the detection is pretty good for a mobile rhythm game.
got, through, it, Love the game, got through it quickly, being a drummer. wish there were more levels.
like, on, pc, i like this gane boi... but i like on pc :>
found, about, it, Execelent game! I thought it was a cool game on itch.io until I found out about it on tablet. Amazing Game , good price Buy it!

Looking, to, addition, This game is one of the best rhythm games I have ever played. The music is catchy and the level graphics are amazing and still well optimized. The concept is an amazing idea and was executed excellently. The balancing on the levels is decent, and the levels are lots of fun to play and unique in their own way. This is a rhythm game for beginners, but not a beginner's rhythm game. Looking forward to the addition of the level editor on the mobile version!
buying, on, mobile, Great game. The one issue i have is that after buying it on mobile, if i wanted to play it with keyboard (touchscreen is less precise) i'd have to buy it on pc too

add, on, mobile, I hope they also add costume level on mobile so I can play whenever I want. Btw I also make an ADOFAI content. Checkout my instagram @bonysubono069 thanks ^^
Bought, on, gplay, Bought a copy of this game on gplay and steam. One for pro gaming and one for casual killing-the-time kind of game.
staying, on, beat, This might be the worst rhythm game I've ever played. I tried calibrating it over and over so I can only conclude that the game intends to punish you for actually staying on beat, so you might as well play it on mute which just makes it a subpar one button game with no purpose

s, In, version, This game is extremely fun and I only have one gripe. In the steam version, theres support for custom maps, but this version doesnt have that. That's completely fine, it's still one of my favorite mobile rythem games.
look, at, game, Amazing Game. I love it so much that I play it almost every day! Its such a brilliant game. I recommend people look at the game first and if they love it, then they should get it.
stay, with, game, Like the warning said, this game is very reliant on rhythm and keeping the beat. That being said, it's a game that have a simple control or gameplay, but really hard to master, at least for me. It is my first time buying a game. Definitely, worth my money. I'm going to stay with this game so my sense of rhythm can be corrected. Hehe.

put, in, %, F*****g dev. The game is extremely challanging and great to play but please!!! put a CHECK POINT in every 30%-50% of the level and in every song!!!. I give a star because it's frustrating to repeat the whole level when the mistake happen at 80% and above. Not everyone can play like a pro. Fix this on the next update. Don't let our purchase go to waste if u didn't do anything with our review.

Works, for, musicians, Very simple nice and at the same time challenging game. Works great for musicians.
freaking, at, level, Nice and freaking challanging at some level. But it will be 5 star if dev make a checkpoint every 20%-30% of the progress. It's frustrating to repeat the whole song when it come to a miss/late tapping at 90% or above. Hope dev can fix this on the next update. Realy love this game anyway.

saw, on, media, Phew! I first thought it was simple when I saw it on social media where influencer plays it, it looks real simple! But after I downloaded it, and experienced, it was extremely interesting and unexpectedly hard. For me, it really is an interesting game and helps you to get the beat well. I highly recommend playing this game!
played, by, that, It's the best game that I ever played its worth by
comes, to, version, Nice game! Played PC version before! Now comes to phone version as my keyboard is spoiling!
used, in, games, An excellent rhythm game that helps build muscle memory used in most rhythm games. Highly suggest to any new or even skilled players of rhythm games.

buy, on, steam, Very epic. Game made well. Will buy on steam
followed, on, pc, Love it, have followed on pc and found out there was mobile
getting, into, genre, This game is really fun! It's the perfect pocket rhythm game when games like Phigros and DEEMO are getting a tad boring, and also perfect for people just getting into the rhythm game genre.. I've personally been playing this game competitively on speedrun leaderboards but it's also a nice game to just relax and play when you're bored or just feel like tapping your screen to the rhythm

love, on, computer, I love this game on computer!! Phone version is awesome! But add more bonus levels!!
get, into, game, The game is simple, it may not look that interesting until you actually play it, which totally blew my mind when I did. How hard could a game with 2 orbs spinning around be? It starts off easy to get players into the game, but the final stages especially the challenges are very difficult. Amazing high quality music and aesthetic level design. As a person who has been playing rhythm games for years, I would say it's one of the best rhythm games out there! Overall, spectacular game!

It starts off easy to get players into the game, but the final stages especially the challenges are very difficult. Amazing high quality music and aesthetic level design.

play, on, break, Love the game, it has some good beat and is great to play on a break.
make, like, account, I LOVED IT, it gets my adrenaline pumping because of how ridicoulusly fun it is. I'm considering to purchase the PC version so I can play the custom levels too as I've finished this mobile version. I just think maybe it'd be nice if there was also custom levels like in PC and/or if there's an option to make like an account to link it with the PC version too. The bad reviews here are all ridiculous, because you can recallibrate and I can play Heracles blindfolded so it's not too hard either.

say, As, years, As someone w/ years of general Rhythm Game playing and high level Mania 4k and CH experience, I can confidently say this is an amazingly put together rhythm game. The music is all original (and very high quality) and it's simple to learn, while also having an astronomical skill ceiling. My only real issue is that touch inputs on phones are notoriously laggy (usually 200ms+) which can make the game very awkward to adjust to at first, as you often need to tap a frame or 2 earlier than you'd think.

playing, for, time, amazing rithm game, it's like playing gd for the firt time again
Bought, on, PC, Bought it on PC and played it there for about an hour or so first, bought it here next just so I can play it on the go. Deceptively difficult, with a low barrier to entry, this is a very fun rhythm game that I'll be burning many hours on!

works, on, mobile, This a really cool and simple beat game that works great on mobile.
progress, from, world, Awesome work! Gets extremely harder when we progress from one world to next, so it would be good if you could add more levels in each world.

found, on, tiktok, This is by far one of my favorite rhythm games. I found it on tiktok, bought it on steam and now I'm on the phone. Even my 4 yr old and 6 yr old are addicted.

get, on, version, You dont get guidance for invisible tiles like on the steam version but it's still a really fun game! Correction: just turn the graphics up 😅
Dude, like, this, Dude like this is awesome
addicted, to, game, I have never gotten so addicted to a mobile game before.
lacking, in, game, This game is great. For me, the only thing lacking in this game is saving progress online, custom level and custom songs. I wish this game had an account to be able to save progress online.

Have, on, Steam, Have this also on Steam. It's rythm game, I like rythm games.
lacking, in, this, Updated Review as the problem was solved. A dance of fire and ice is honestly a game one should get if they even have a little bit of intrest in rhythm games. The only thing lacking in this, is custom songs but that's not really needed to enjoy the game fully. Beautiful sound and design
done, with, level, Very good game! The first 5 worlds are quite fun and have just the right amount of challenge, and the extra's level was extremely difficult but had checkpoints every 15-25%, which was extremely nice! And then world 6 happened. I have over 50 tries on world 6 alone, and I'm not even past 30% done with the final level of that. What ever happened to the steady difficulty curve? And it only gets harder from there. If there was an option to have checkpoints every 20% that would be extremely helpful.

work, despite, input, Fun game, but the audio calibration for my headphones doesn't work despite vert consistent input from my end, so I can only use it without headphone.

registered, in, time, Not sure if its the game or my device, but there are quite a bit of taps not being registered in time or at all. Aside from that, this is fun as hell and challenging
satisfying, in, moment, Very fun and feels satisfying in the moment and after
had, for, day, I've only had the game for a day and already love it. It is pretty challenging and a ton of fun
Had, with, calibration, It's a blast! Had a bit of trouble with the calibration, but once I got the time on sync it became a way better experience
saw, on, tiktok, I love it. I saw it on tiktok and bought it. I enjoy it overall but I'm kinda disappointed that there aren't any checkpoints, especially on longer levels.

found, through, tiktok, Honestly, found this game through a tiktok showing it played on PC. Blew my mind I had to try it. It really rewrites how you mind thinks about matching rhythm in a good way!

done, w, levels, Takes a second to get used to but its pretty simple, downloaded like a week ago and im done w all the levels already. Beats are very good especially 11 and 12. Cant wait for more levels

needed, in, opinion, This game is very good for the most part, there are a few things needed in my opinion, such as a practice mode as if you keep messing up on one part at the end of a long sequence you have to redo the entire song just to mess up again.

take, to, stars, I think this is a great game! I notice I have to calibrate kinda often while having a session but I don't mind that too much. What would take it to 5 stars for me is maybe a built in screen recorder because I'd love to share my perfect runs with my friends!

throw, across, room, While this game has made me throw my phone across my room several times, I have to agree that it's really fun and addictive. I think the 2 dollars were worth it! Update: When I tried to play this game three days after downloading it the screen was just black even though I closed it and reopened it about five times. When I uninstalled it then reinstalled it, my entirw progress was deleted and I had to start over. I didnt really mind as I still liked the game but the screen turned black again.
hate, in, few, Honestly terrible if you ask me, you only get to calibrate once so if you mess it up may as well kiss this game goodbye. Also, I honestly hate how the screen transitions so suddenly in a few of the songs. Mainly in the final song of world two. I am frustrated beyond belief since I've been stuck on world 2's final song for maybe 30 minutes now. I think I'll just stick to a steam rythm game instead.

struggled, with, one, I struggled with the 3rd one
take, to, 5, Great game play but there are tiny little features missing that can make it frustrating to play. Checkpoints for longer stages and a practice mode would take this to a 5 for sure. It's annoying to keep messing up on a key part late in a long stage

Saw, on, tiktok, Saw this one on tiktok and instantly had to buy it! Could be less then a dollar maybe
play, in, levels, The game is really good and looks fun to play especially in later levels but the HUGE issue I'm having is that I can't calibrate it. If I try calibrating it then the whole game is offbeat by a whole note and just won't let me have it any other way, I can play it on the notes if I keep the default calibration but then the problem is that I have to click just a little off beat every time if I wanna be able to play at all. Please fix this or tell me how to, I r e a l l y wanna play

saw, on, stream, Definitely worth checking out! I saw this game on a stream and was very happy to know it was available on mobile as well
recommend, for, kids, This is the best rhythm game I ever bought it but I'm not recommend for kids under 10 because it has a super extreme gameplay very nice game :D

play, unlike, lot, unlike a lot of rythym games, because of the calibration, i actually can play to the beat. most of the older games are off by a few seconds, but this one is amazingly accurate

give, on, difficulty, 8 hours deep now and I love the pain! Stages 3 & 6 give a bad impression on the difficulty by being overly long and uninteresting musically, but 7-11 are some of the finest pieces of rhythm gaming I've played in years. The jazzier, off-tempo instrumentals lend themselves really well to the tile-based system, with the bass drum on later electronic tracks driving behind every note tapped. It really builds into a fantastic game. Don't let 6-X ruin that!

humming, during, day, Fantastic rhythmical game. The music is catchy and you will find yourself humming it randomly during the day! No ads! What a bonus! Definitely recommend!
addicting, as, hell, One of the best rythym games on Android, hands down. If you're into games like this then you'll love this one. Absolutely addicting as hell and just a joy to play. Just goes to show how much more important the actual gameplay is in a game, than it's graphics are. Props to the developer(s). Awesome job!!
challenging, with, music, Great game! Fun and challenging with good music.
miss, from, PC, Really fun port to movile, good job! I kinda miss the interactive home menu from PC, though...
felt, at, shortness, Played the flash version. Loved it but felt sad at its shortness. Now, over two years later i accidentally find it's on both steam and android and i just couldn't hold my finger
added, in, while, I love EVERY minute of this. It is so fleshed out, even though it has a one button control. Amazing for a great cost. Edit: After all of the updates, this game is even BETTER than the original version, with new free content being added once in a while. It adds a lot of challenge, but it is VERY worth it. Amazing rhythm gameplay for a low cost, and its got a great difficulty curve, I recommend it 100%.
got, for, birthday, Best game ever! When i got this game for my birthday i thought it was amazing! Cant wait to beat it!
move, through, stages, A charming, wonderful one-button rhythm game I have adored ever since it was just a finished proof-of-concept. You will move your way through many well-crafted stages with custom music and heaps of love, all with the brutal unforgivingness that makes it all the more worth it. Ever since the full release, the game is beautiful whose graphics complement the experience with so much room for creativity and expression. I love this game. I even have it on Steam too! Much love from the UKSRT folks!

allow, to, saves, Great rythm game, only thing I'd want to be added is to allow steam to mobile saves if that would be possible.
stick, with, calibration, Bought the PC version on Steam, but kinda hard to calibrate (so I just stick with the default calibration for now)
enjoy, with, challenge, Really fun and addictive with a great challenge. I reccomend this to those who enjoy rhythm games with a great challenge and simple controls
wait, for, 3, I like the game But if you can make the bigining of the level start by tap not by counting No 1 2 3 just tap ang go Because it is boring avry time i lose and start again and wait for 1 2 3
move, on, cause, The windup is a bad stage and I cant move on cause of it I've been trying for weeks and I've beaten every stage I could but this level is holding me back from having fun

playing, for, sometime, Great Rhythm game. I've been playing it for quite sometime on both my cellphone and PC. This game was developed by a company that understands musical theory and how to turn it on its head. I cant wait for their next game Rhythm Doctor to finally get its release. Keep it up.

enjoyed, since, Cytus, If you like rhythm games, you will love this! Simple and executed fantastically. I haven't enjoyed a rhythm game this much since Cytus. I love that you can speed up the tracks to really test your limits. It adds the sense that you can always do better which is great for replayability. The training levels before the full "boss track" is a nice touch and the music itself is enjoyable to listen to, especially towards the end. The final track genuinely feels like a reward! Really great job :)

fall, into, problem, An absolutely wonderful game that achieves everything it sets out to be - a simple, yet challenging rhythm game. Due to the controls being so simple, it doesn't fall into the problem that most other mobile rhythm games have, which is being harder to play on a smaller screen. A Dance of Fire and Ice plays wonderfully on any device that can run it. The gameplay paired with equally fantastic music and surprisingly engaging custom visuals for each level makes the price tag absolutely worth it. 5/5.

recommend, to, anyone, Great rhythm game. Very difficult as well. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone who like rhythm games.
acess, to, 12, Is it just me or do they say over 100 levels but i have acess to only 12?
make, in, version, Amazing game but I have just 1 request, please add the ability to make a custom level like in the PC version, thanks for your time :D
Owned, on, PC, Great game! Owned it on PC and loved it!
filled, with, nothing, Easy to pick up hard to master, after being tired of the top rhythm game charts being filled with nothing but clones of the same 3 games it's refreshing to have something actually engaging which doesn't bombard you with advertising every 30 or so seconds. I reccomend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of rhythm games, if they have somehow not heard of it already.

start, from, place, Great game! It would be great if there was a "practice mode" like in Beat Saber or guitar hero. A mode where you can start from a specific place, no-fail enabled and the option to reduce speed. Unrelated: Whoever made level 9. Please more of that!
bought, on, pc, Love the game, bought it on pc and mobile just to support the creator
learn, because, tutorials, Great game at first try it was hard but you will slowly learn how to do it because of the tutorials even if your new to the game also It has a Great graphics and effects too.
Looking, to, songs, SUPER challenging yet super fun! The beats are fun to play to and the graphics are amazing as well. Still havent beaten everything and it always presentes a challenge and ultimate playability. Looking forward to more songs!
having, with, game, Yeah I'm having fun with this game... The calibration kinda hard to understand but it doesn't matter... The control are good and the gameplay is easy to catchup... Really hope level editor will be added soon...
love, to, day, I remember when this was first on Kongregate. I was first to comment, iirc... still love it to this day! Edit: It's great to see the game come so far! The levels are beautiful and the newer ones are the perfect amount of challenging.
lends, to, platform, I have this game on PC too, and the simple single button control-style lends itself to any platform very well. Catchy music, fun visuals, and a new way of presenting music theory and patterns to those who aren't musically-inclined.
finished, on, steam, Originally I finished this on steam. Its very addictive that I had to buy it for my phone too, and it works no differently to the pc version A fun Rhythm game.

saw, about, game, This game is amazing! If you like games like osu! or other rythm games you're going to love this one, its simple to play but hard to master, the original music its super catchy and perfect for the gameplay, i would also recommend this game if you are a musician. I bought it twice cause its also available for pc. Im super happy I saw that tokaku and miraie video about this game. Love it!
tailored, to, gameplay, A suprisingly well made music game with original music tailored specifically to the gameplay. Constant updates with added hidden levels.
play, on, mobile, To play on mobile and pc hehe xd
juiced, to, perfection, Easy but thorougly enjoyable rythm-based mechanic, that is juiced to perfection. Love it!
had, from, players, Solid Rhythm game. Love the music and quirks some of the levels have. Wish it had custom levels from players, or curated levels.
tap, to, type, This game is a very fun and challenging rhythm game! The concept of the game is very simple while giving you a very easy "just tap to the beat" type of gameplay. It does a very good job at expanding on how to play while increasing the difficulty. I highly recommend you play this game!
played, on, phone, Best game I've ever played on a phone. Great for drummers. Innovative approach to rhythm games and awesome songs. Update: moooore leveeeels aaahhhrrggg!!! Can't stop!
keep, with, beat, One of the best rhythm games I've played. Very simple, yet very challenging. It helps train your ear rhythmically to keep up with the beat. Really enjoyable. Well done. Hope you guys create more rhythm games.
gets, in, levels, Very simple game mechanics, which gets quite challenging in later levels. I had no Lags whatsoever on my OP3, which is critical for a good expirience. No ads, just the game. Can recommend! I also tried the online Demo of "Rhythm Doctor", which i can also recommend. It's also a Single Button Rhythm game, but with completely different mechanics.

playing, for, years, I've been playing for years. Love this game
play, with, headphones, Incredibly fun rhythm game, really provided a challenge, but was never too infuriating. Also, the input delay can be calibrated, so it means I can play with Bluetooth headphones connected, which really improves the game, because I can now play when out and about.
faded, into, background, Severe difficulty spike after 5-x, but other than that love your game! Love the aesthetic and the music. First time I was interested in playing a rhythm game. Sometimes I get angry because I cant hear the beat because it faded into the background. This game is an absolute steal for $2 Cheers, Donovan
see, in, this, Please add Google Play achievements and the ability to transfer/save data! The game is pretty much like Geometry Dash in similar aspects and it's really good. Would like to see a level editor in this soon!
come, from, tokaku, Just come here from tokaku :)
added, in, updates, Wonderful game! I love the concept of using angles to represent beats, and I enjoyed it very much. The graphical options are appreciated, as are the new levels that are being added in updates! This game is a definite 5/5 for me. Thank you, everyone on the dev team. Highly recommended. P.S. My heart was beating out of my chest during the 6-X speed trial, lol. Took me a while but I did it!

play, with, pen, it will be better if I could play it with S-pen.
spent, for, it, Updated! The Good: As a rhythm game, the concept is neat, the execution is very good, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The visualization of percussion and beats was refreshing. The Bad: The calibration is still a little iffy, in my experience. The Ugly: Nothing, really. Previously, this paid app was the same as its free browser counterpart, but with updates to graphics and several additional worlds, it's well worth the $3 I spent for it years ago. It's been a joy revisiting this masterpiece!
Played, on, pc, Love the game, love the music. Played it on pc and still do but bought it to support the maker. 4 years later and I still love the music and the game - heck a few of the songs are on my daily listen list. Trying the new stuff now. The game is way more polished than last time I tied it.
said, with, that, Good work on the fixes. I saw the changes and im glad, especially with the new levels coming in. I also have the pc version and with that said if its not too much to ask, will we ever get the ability to play custom maps in here? I mean its okay if we cant make our own custom levels here but being able to play custom maps here would be amazing.
playing, through, game, This is my third time playing through this game. It is a phenomenal rhythm game with amazing, and unique music as well as a creative but easy to understand concept. The graphics are a little downgraded compared to the computer version but that's to be expected I think, the game still looks wonderful and keeps essentially all of its charm.

Works, with, phone, After all these updates this game is so great that its one of my favourite android games now. I love how devs are always adding new worlds, which are all great. The mechanism is very simple and calibration comes often handy. Works well with my phone and emulator too.
Followed, since, WAY, Followed this game since WAY back then. Congratulation on getting top spot on paid app! Good luck on Rhythm Doctor, will buy it once you released it on Android ^^

have, on, phone, The game is fabulous on steam. love the music. love the gameplay. I thought it would be amazing to have it on my phone. However, it's obvious that the developer have made no effort on optimising the game for mobile users. The game is lag af and unplayable on my phone (Huawei p20 lite). I hope this could be improved. until then.
restart, into, beat, Really good. Could be better if it had an exit button and if it remembered last progress so one can continue without having to manually skip tutorials. Also, a wonderful feature would be to have the initial beat of the level continue after failing, so one can seamlessly restart the level into that beat. Ending the audio abruptly upon failing is very anticlimactic. Same for the menu music that ends abruptly when entering the settings - at least fade it out!

find, to, Devs, simple but fun! (i would consider it a hard game) nice, that there are new levels, keep it up! to Devs: i find myself playing the game only orientating with hearing because video ist sometimes a bit laggy. how about coloring the floor green or red depending on hitting perfect / too late/... (different colors for early and late!!)

change, to, sound, Absolutely love this game, and it just so happens that I'm a drummer too. I'm addicted to it! A real pity that it's so short though. Would've loved it even more if it had some endless mode etc. Just 3 suggestions for the game. One, there's no orientation change even when rotating the phone. Please implement this! Two, an option to disable haptic feedback would be nice. Maybe change it to a sound instead too. Three, my 'worlds' all have accuracy over 100%. Not sure if it's a bug? Thank you!
buy, on, platform, I am a huge fan. I will buy this game on every platform.

broken, for, me, Amazing game, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, World #3, Level X is currently broken for me (Love Letters) - at about 19%-20%, when the screen flashes and the base kicks in, instead of proceeding with the beat, the spheres stay in one place and on the next beat you lose. I've tried this level about 20 times and I'm pretty sure it's a bug (Samsung S7 with Android 8.0 and build 1.0.5 ~ r15). Please fix this!

try, for, everyone, Now my lag issue has been resolved (really fast and helpful answer!), i can give it the full 5 stars it earns. (for everyone else who has a lag problem: try increasing the offset by ~0.20. Bluetooth speakers might be the cause of it lagging)

looking, after, years, This game is amazing! I remember buying this long ago. Now I am looking back at it after a few years disappointed on the lack of new levels. Please make more levels!

line, with, calibration, Even with calibration some of the song beats don't line up.
had, for, levels, This game is fun,fresh,and keeps me wanting to play more. Please keep making levels for this game. I would pay if I had to for more levels. keep up the great work .
wait, for, more, This is awesome. The beats and songs :O!! Cant wait for more. Im recommending this to so many of my mates. One thing, if you could have a verses option so I can verse my brother haha and more beats please!!

waiting, in, time, I absolutely love it, really addicting game! One of the best rhythm game I have ever played, I'm waiting for new updates to come, in the mean time I am stuck at 3-X (1.1x). Can you add like maybe easy mode or something? because it gets really challenging. other than that, fun experience. 6/5

comparing, to, version, Cool mechanics, visuals and the difficulty is just right (for me atleast). It's kinda sorta laggy (in frames) for some reason but that's just me comparing it to the web version. It's still very playable since you don't really have to rely on visuals in this game too much.

break, into, chunks, A really great, absorbing game. The only thing that would make it better would be the ability to break the long, hard levels into practice chunks. There are areas in the long levels that require a certain amount of repetitive practice to internalize the rhythm, but playing over the entire level to get to that point causes finger fatigue, which makes any kind of repetitive practice both difficult and painful.

share, with, people, I have deleted all the others.   Clever mechanic and visuals. Fun and addictive, great to share with people. frustrating enough to keep you playing and fun enough/ enough of a skill barrier to keep you coming back.   any time i need a 5-10 min break this is the only game I need.
played, on, Kongregate, A rhythm gamer friend of mine and i played this first on Kongregate and we loved it. I bought it to support the creator and in hopes to get more levels! We bothe also want a level creator/editor. Id love to make my own songs!                                                Edit: its been a while and im sooo looking forward to new content! I was also wondering if, now that the Nintendo 3DS is going to have Unity support, if a verson for it will be created? Edit 2: awesome! Im so excited to see more in this!

lags, on, nexus, Found this game online today! Once I figured out is was on Android I bought it, unfortunately it lags on the nexus 6... :(
getting, with, level, There's a similar game out called Skyward, and while that has better graphics, I think you have better gameplay here by introducing a rhythm element. That and you don't have ads. It's fun but doesn't look great.  Reply: Dude, getting ratings as high as this with this level of graphics is an achievement. I look forward to seeing the look change. :)
played, on, browser, As others have said, I played on browser but bought anyway to support. Also, I would like to get in touch with the developer for some questions, as this topic is my masters thesis.

struggle, with, something, I play this game when I have a bad day or struggle with something. It reminds me that there are things in life I am worse at.
looking, for, game, I spent another night looking for a better rhythm game.  A game called Radiohammer looked promising but the controls weren't responsive so it's useless.  If you want an android rhythm game this is it!  God I'm sick of guitar-hero style rhythm games--I played DDR a long time ago and got over it!  Anyway, this Dev is responsive and his appreciation of Rhythm Tengoku (the best rhythm game) shows.  Maybe he'll team up with some other like-minded folks and create a full-fledged game like Rhythm Tengoku?!

keep, like, me, Love this game!  It's simple but oh so challenging!  I wish there were more levels!   This game isn't for the faint of heart.  (or people who can't keep a rhythm like me).  There's something so wonderful about this game that keeps me coming back.  FIVE STARS!  Great job.  I'd pay good money if there was a sequel!
happen, to, store, Fun, addicting, occasionally frustrating, this game is simple and fun to play. If every developer could make these kinds of games for the price range of &lt;$2, they could be the best thing to happen to the app store.
Getting, on, tool, Getting an A on the calibration tool was a bit of extra fun. However I feel that the buttons on the screen could be smaller, and the calibration number a little bigger. Overall it was quite short and I'm looking forward to more worlds or other game modes too.

throwing, at, me, This game is amazing, it takes me back to the days of playing rock band everynight. I like that it's throwing odd rhythms at me that I don't normally hear in music too. My only problem is that I get little lag spikes every once in a while, does anyone know a fix for this? I've tried stopping all background apps and it still happens, just enough lag to mess me up :( Edit: I'm using a galaxy S5 if it helps, also really hoping this gets updated in the future, nice work dev!

prove, to, myself, I even had to try the calibration mini-game several times just to prove to myself that I could get an "A"
spent, on, app, Great music, a fast pace and lots of fun, which makes it easy to get drawn in.   Had enough fun for it to be an easy 5 stars to give, but this game clearly has lots more potential for future updates.  Best 60p spent on an app in a long time.
