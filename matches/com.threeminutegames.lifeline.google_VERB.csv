lasts, for, hours, WARNING do NOT buy this game! The developer says no inapp purchases required, this is Not quite the case. The game only lasts for about 3 hours including any transmission breaks take out those and the game lasts approximately 5 minutes. You then get advised to move too (download) Lifeline 2 costing another ¬£1.69 not a lot but for 5 minutes of gameplay outrageous! BTW It doesn't deserve even 1 star but without that I can't post this Warning for all of you.

talk, like, this, The idea is neat but the writing is terrible and trying too hard to be quirky. Nobody would talk like this in such a situation. It totally takes you out of the situation. Some humor here and there is fine, some quirky dialog here and there is fine, but if seems like every time Taylor says something it's like something I'd write in middle school. If you want a serious tone go elsewhere. Taylor talks like a Redditor

work, on, smartwatches, Had to uninstall. Advertised to work on smartwatches, which is the reason I bought it, but only does so when the app is open on the phone and the phone unlocked. If you were hoping to play this mostly from your watch, stear clear.

waiting, in, time, I loved the whole actually waiting in real time and the story ‚ò∫Ô∏è
progresses, in, time, What an interesting and unique game experience! I love that the game progresses in real time. (The character might go to sleep and message again 6 hours later.) It's keeping me engaged and feeling like I'm really communicating with someone out there.

gave, to, books, This is a nice little story! It gave me pleasant flashbacks to the old Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books that I loved years ago. (What's more, I've been playing it in German for language-learning purposes. Conversational and new scifi vocabulary! It's great!)

feel, like, person, I'm bored to death. Taylor doesn't feel like a person, he feels like a collection of jokes thrown together by a writer desperately trying to be interesting. The waiting is not suspenseful. It feels like standing in line. It feels like it was a ploy to make me wait past the point where the playstore would approve a refund. It feels like waiting for your candy crush lives to fill up. Maybe if I had access to a monitor of his vitals or the conditions on the moon?

paid, for, game, The character is totally unrelatable and annoying. While playing, some part of me is happy when he is accidentally die. I dont even get why I would want to help him other than I had paid for the game. Go die on the moon alone with that attitude.

worrying, about, character, If you want a modern "Choose your own adventure game", then this is the game for you. I enjoyed every moment! The story was mysterious, suspenseful, and emotional. You find yourself worrying about the main character Taylor, and really wanting to help. An amazing and engaging story! I will continue to follow the Lifeline series and I hope they continue to make more amazing stories
recommend, to, friends, Absolutely fantastic and well worth the money, I've recommend it to all my friends!
playing, for, day, I've only been playing for a day, but this is such a interesting concept, and Taylor is a really likeable character. I'm fascinated to see where it goes! I read about it on an article by The Live Life, they said it was one of the top 5 mobile games worth playing :) Then onyl criticism I'd say (from my limited experience this far) would be the option to check in on him occasionally? Even if it is limited to the game providing you with the opportunity, rather than being able to do it whenever.

Interacting, with, subject, Ok. It's graphics are simple but when you are actively playing, you understand why. So now I can say I love this game! Interacting with the subject was exciting and you feel obligated to help.
reccomend, to, anyone, Amazing amazing amazing!!! I recently replayed this after playing it years ago and its just as good! The story is amazingly mysterious, perfect if you're a fan of games like Subnautica, amazing, would highly reccomend to anyone who's a fan of science fiction :)
got, to, games, I played all these games back when I was in high school and loved them! I just heard the company got their rights to the games back and we might get more soon, definitely recommend 10/5
pause, between, gameplay, 89 pence well spent! Original storyline, moody music, snappy dialogue and it makes you pause between gameplay which just heightens your sense of time within the game. Died once as a result of my decisions but managed to get to the end without too many mishaps. Might go back and try different decisions on 'fast' mode. Will probably get the sequel too.

becomes, after, while, Pros: great art, the story is actually pretty good at first. The app runs smoothly and you get to make decisions to help another character. Multiple endings. Cons: after a while, the main character you help becomes mean and insults themselves a lot, which made me not want to spend time with them. The choices end up mostly panic or misery, so it's not good for depressed people.

playing, with, delays, A fascinating story. I do recommend playing it with the intended delays, makes it feel much more like events are unfolding far away.
do, for, guys, Such a fresh game only started it and I love it already feels so real hope an additional game comes out EDIT a new game is coming would love to do a live action trailer for you guys!
spend, on, entertainment, My Favorite Paced Story Space Game EVER!!! Best dollar I think I've ever spend on entertainment. If you're looking for a game to draw your boredom for every few minutes in the beginning days to hours on the last day like I played you'll be incredibly satisfied with the paths this beautiful game presents. Its easy to work the sound design is simple but spacey, along with the few sighs and blips that force you into the suit with Tayler and closer to her as you fight to save her from so far away.

helps, with, immersion, I really like this game. If you're looking an adventure/story type game this is for you. The fact that you have to wait for Taylor to do wake up, or finish a task really helps with the immersion. I've already played it multiple times and have had it less than a week!
played, with, friend, Great game and the pacing is perfect. Almost completely accessible to blind players. I played this along with a blind friend and had a great time. Only criticism is at the very end there is text said by other people and the speaker is shown by the text colour, thus not accessible to blind players. I had to explain to my friend that there were now multiple speakers because they were very confused. If you could change it to say the speakers name when it's not Taylor, that would be good.

grow, on, you, One of the best mobile experiences. The real-time makes it immersive unlike anything else, Taylor will grow on you, I haven't genuinely cared about a fictional character so much before! Totally recommend.

recommend, to, everyone, A thrilling experience that I would recommend to everyone.
spent, on, this, Definitely worth the dollar I spent on this. A very cool concept, although this particular iteration could have been written better. Very glad I experienced the game. However, this game NEEDS to have a function to automatically scroll to the bottom. I can't count how many times I had to open the app and manually scroll ALL the way to the bottom of the text. Ending had me on edge but was slightly dissatisfying.

played, for, time, I love how they made this Taylor non gender specific so i can imagine him/her the way i want. To me Taylor is a he. I played this game for the first time years ago when first Whiteout didnt came out yet. I feel so bad for not having any new Lifeline games to play with. I hope someone will revamp it.
trapped, in, planet, While taylor was trapped in that planet i was trapped in the story.

written, as, story, Well written, not really a game so much as a story but still really good
made, at, turn, This was amazing. Such a beautiful storyline and super suspenseful with difficult decisions to be made at every turn. Beautiful. 10/10
love, about, it, An amazing game with an extraordinary story. I've played it over 4 times and I love everything about it. There is a whole series ahead that I've also played (Lifeline 2, Silent Night, Halfway to Infinity, Flatline, and Crisis Line). The series is great, and I hope the developers make more.
thought, in, fact, I really didn't enjoy this. I didn't find the protagonist engaging at all and in fact I thought was kinda whiny and irritating.. was expecting the story to branch more and last longer and as a tech comment many of the protagonist's comments were cut off and there was no way for me to expand them to be able to read the whole thing
Played, after, while, Played it again after a long while and was not disappointed. Love the breaks within the game which prevent you from binging this story through in an hour or whatever.

Felt, like, interactive, Very fun, first time playing a text based game. Felt like an interactive choose your own adventure. I died once :(
looking, to, rest, This took me about 3-4 days to finish including waiting times but i enjoyed the story and looking forward to the rest. I dont know how impactful the choices are but some of them are unimportant and some of them are really important i guess(and its good this way. Not every choice has to be a life or death situation). Totally worth the payment(app is very cheap) with the story writing and game-coding.
play, through, story, This is just awesome. Do yourself a favor and play through this great story
bought, in, 2016, Best game ever. I bought this back in 2016, July and there was nothing like it on the Play or App Store. Totally worth the buck. The story is captivating, the characters are someone you could fear and care for. Relatable and uncanny. It feels like a great adventure epic James Cameron film. Bravo.

think, in, end, Overall, fairly enjoyable. A good branching plot with some fun choices. The protag can be a little whiny at times, but in the end I think that only adds to his whole character and the development of the story. Tip: the earlier you fail at the mission the sooner you can enable fast mode which will let you play the story at will. TBH, I felt that turning on fast mode kind of took the fun out of the delayed message system so steer clear of that if you want the intended experience.

invested, in, kid, I think whichever Lifeline game you end up playing first will be your favorite. They're all good, but this one is dear to my heart as the first that got me emotionally invested in some imaginary kid with only intermittent text interface, lol. You can't really describe why this is so worthwhile to play; just play it. You'll see.

matter, through, game, Okay half way through the game it kinda doesn't matter what you do taylor will choose own course by not taking your advice but it was still fun at the beginning
Choose, at, best, Choose Your Own Adventure at its best, anchored by a solidly-written main character.
playing, through, it, it was ok. decent for the price. however the story is too short and after playing through it again, the choices don't have a significant effect on the end. in fact most choices aren't even really choices because the character has a mind of its own. suspense is built by making you wait extended periods of time. so mostly hardly any replayability. i guess the devs didn't want to put much effort in... (please buy for the story and support the devs because the story is actually pretty good)

developed, with, quality, Fantastic game, and they have taken feedback and developed the game further with quality of life features and the like. It's a great story experience, especially for the Sci fi horror lover.
delivered, in, way, Fantastic interactive story delivered in a great way
cried, on, Day, I LOVED it. No spoilers, but I definitely almost cried on Day 3. I wish it was free, but due to the quality I understand. Saving up for the next one!

had, on, edge, Honestly one of the most enticing and nail biting plots to a game that I've found yet. It had me on the edge of my seat and craving more and more all of the time. Definitely am about to go play the other lifelines next.
play, in, sessions, Fun experience, short but only can play in short sessions.
given, at, times, Not a cyoab .. Not a game ... The parts that make you wait do not build suspense since you arent given either clear choices at times or illogical/piss poor choices .... This is a simple and linear story that lacks immersion and is weakly entertaining ... I would like a refund ..this is not worth paying for...

finished, after, years, EDIT:: just finished a replay after all these years, and I had just as much fun this time as I did the first time. I'm excited to play these games all over again ‚ù§Ô∏è It is so easy to believe you are talking to a real person in real time; this is a whole new level of immersive! Truly a unique and incredible app that feels like a crazy experience! I felt a connection with the person on the other end instantly. Would highly recommend !!

crawls, for, days, Even though the concept of a sci-fi story unfolding in real-time is intriguing, the plot absolutely crawls for the first 3 days. Taylor goes back and forth on so many decisions, and questions his/her perceptions constantly (and guess who has to reassure them, constantly!). I gave up before their second attempt at going to the spire. Maybe the story picks up from there, but I've lost interest.

beat, in, days, You really start to feel as if you are texting a real person. The only complaint I have is that it's a fairly short game, I beat it in 3 days. Other than that it's perfect. üíØ percent worth the 2 dollars.
playing, till, game, Excellent game! I love it! Once I'm done playing this one Imma download the next one and on and on till the last game!
made, to, end, I love this lol I actually made it to the end safely my first try. I'm such a good coach. Whoever created this game, keep going. You've done damn good job
asking, for, refund, I bought this game, at first I liked it, then I got bored of it. I have emailed the company many times asking for a refund, but they dont reply.
gets, at, time, Great game great story gets wierd at time but still very cool if you like sci fi, takes about 3-4 days to finish if you have a busy schedule. I like that you can play it for very short burst of time and your still in control of how much time you want to spend playing the game unlike most titles, definitely recommend

feels, at, price, DO NOT BUY. Bad story design, needs multiple endings to feel complete. This (even at half price) feels like it's not worth buying. This feels like the free trial version of the game, add a longer story, more endings, more things to do, or a combo of all the above. This would have been a 4/5 star if it was free.

get, to, eventuality, I'd love to see more of this style game... Maybe something longer with more possible ways to get to each eventuality.
care, for, person, Rudely good. How dare y'all make me care for a fake person so deeply?! Good thing I got him out alive on my first playthrough, else I'd've needed therapy.
see, in, game, It's an excellent game... I'd really love to see Taylor in another game, similar if not exactly like this one. Just with a new story. I genuinely cared about Taylor, and wanted to get him/her home. It's an amazing game, and I'm gonna play it through again. I was sad when I ended the story. Time for another round.

Starts, without, mode, A fairly lengthy game. Starts off quite slow, especially without fast mode. But when the story picks up, it picks up.
escape, from, landing, Very interesting story, although most of the jokes are pretty terrible. I'm sure some people would enjoy that humor more than myself. You help a stident escape from a space shop crash landing on a mysterious moon. Wish the dialogue options were more varied, ther were a few times the two input optiona fekt interchangeable.

Got, on, recommendation, Got this on a friend's recommendation. It was a lot of fun! Great story and really cool way of interacting. I reaponded to Taylor much fater than i ever do my actual text messages ü§£

did, for, games, this did a lot for text based games for me. and I love the suspense and fear.
played, in, while, Best game I've played in a while!
looking, to, more, I have downloaded and played all of the Lifeline games because they are good stories with good commentary. I am looking forward to more!
happened, to, him, At the first mission was a little slow but the second and third one was what really got me. I felt so connected to the imaginary person and I felt responsible for whatever happened to him. A phenomenal game.  A+
goes, on, device, excellent story so far, my only complaint is that on my device, the text sometimes goes past the bottom of a text block, so i can't read the last few lines of what is being said. this definitely detracts from the story allot... if it weren't for that, this would be a solid 5 star story

connected, to, character, This text-based game really makes you connected to the main character, and has a lot of super tense moments. Not just one of my favorite TBGs, one of my favorite games period.
addicting, with, games, fun and addicting with no mini games you have to do to proceed.
attached, to, protagonist, Bought this three years back, and still love it. I don't know why people are being so grumpy about the storyline; it is the best sci-fi text based game there is, in my opinion. The story is so engaging and makes you feel attached to the protagonist, unlike most out there. Buy it, you won't regret. Don't mind the negative reviews.
work, with, watch, love the games but been trying to get them to work with my samsung watch but the notification comes through ok but cant select answers through it any ideas anyone?

made, through, play, Fun idea for a choose your adventure type game, but the execution is lacking. The game paths turned out the same even when I made different choices through the game play. Also does not notify me through Wear OS (though probably not the fault of the game).

take, with, Taylor, An enjoyable adventure, for sure. I fel lt the urgency of thr character's predicament and was taken in by the story. I've only played through once, but I'm hoping there are some alternate paths I can take with Taylor to really flesh out the story and setting. Good work!!
sucked, into, story, amazing! got sucked into story!
attached, to, this, I am very much attached to this the moment i finished it, and still am 4 years later.
stare, at, phone, This game is great for short breaks from work. If you don't stare at your phone all day, this game goes on for days. Interacting with Taylor can cause one to become fairly curious about what would happen to him. Although the jokes are not that funny (for me), but persevering through the jokes is another interesting factor of the game. Definitely going to get the sequel.

play, with, ratio, I decided to replay these great games and have found out they do not play well with Samsung's aspect ratio. A lot of the sentences are cut short, missing words to finish it what Taylor said. Also the buttons for for answers are scrunched up and the words overflow. Wish these would get fixed. Still a great experience though.
think, for, himself, I like the real-time concept, but I don't think I've ever encountered a playable character that I wanted to kill more! He's rude, ungrateful, sarcastic and generally obnoxious, plus apparently can't think for himself. The developers overthought the writing - they tried too hard on the personality, and made it dislikeable. They should have stuck to straight, interactive storytelling, adventure book style. What, where, problem, solution. I don't want 8 messages in a row, mostly useless filler.

got, to, ship, [SPOILERS] I only wish there were more life or death situations. I got him safely to the ship at the end. And I wish my decisions were harder to make with more consequences. Also wish it was a bit longer. Other than that it was great and really entertaining!

going, on, lol, I love this app/game!! I just hate when Taylor is "busy", I wish I could see whats going on lol!! Other than that it is very entertaining! edit: still fun in 2019 lol!
do, in, case, Really cool game. A couple of the choices were not what I would like to do in either case, but it was not a hindrance to the gameplay, and didn't annoy me so much that I couldn't have fun. There were several times where I genuinely didn't know where the story would go depending on my choice, which added to the suspense when Taylor went silent. Great idea, good mystery. I would love to see more options at each crossroad, but I know how much extra work that would be.

spend, at, redbox, Well worth the $2. You can spend that at redbox and entertain yourself for a few hours or you can buy this and be entertained for days! I literally didn't want to put my phone down as things were coming to a conclusion!

get, through, step, Absolute favorite game. I have all three; I wish they'd hurry up and release a fourth. These are fantastic, especally if you enjoy choce-based games. No matter how many times I play it, I always get emotionally attached and get so scared for Taylor through every step of their journey. 10/10 have played multiple times and will play again.
invested, in, success, I actually felt a connection with Taylor. I was genuinely invested in his success.
wait, for, messages, I enjoyed this interactive, real time story. Being forced to wait for messages, as you guide the protagonist, was the right call (albeit fast play and rewind options become available after the first play through). Note it's quite short, you don't have a huge amount of genuine options/alternatives and it's actually quite hard to kill the person you're guiding. Bear this in mind and the limited replayability it means and you won't be disappointed - it's a bit different and good, cheap fun.

Love, on, 2nd, Love the game on first 2nd and 3rd try 10/10 would recommend.
based, on, choices, This game has many possible senerios that unfold based on your choices. The story of the game is great. I like the time between communications, it makes it feel more immersive. This game is hands down one of the best mobile games.
played, at, time, I just can't get enough of the series. I got so greedy I actually played 4 of them at one time.
feel, on, fact, He died the first time I played through and I may never feel right on the fact that if he was real I would've drove him to his death but it's ok because he's not real but I'll still cry inside knowing I gave him the wrong advice

required, for, playthrough, Amazing story telling. Great writing, I like that the waiting is required for the first playthrough only. I love that there are multiple endings. Love the game, highly recommended.
make, for, Taylor, Loved every second of the game. It's awesome how every decision you make for Taylor has an outcome whether he lives or dies. I enjoyed it couldn't be happier with the purchase.
looking, for, icon, Strangely, amusingly, and a bit surprisingly, this story is very compelling and engaging. I find myself eagerly looking for the notification icon that Taylor has returned for more interaction. The writing/dialogue is a delight, too.

receive, from, him, He taught me patience, can't wait for receive messages from him. Believe me Taylor!
left, in, limbo, I want to keep playing it but sometimes I ignore the poor soul. I left the guy in limbo and I'm afraid to start the game in case he asks where I been.

refuses, after, day, Great game, with one major flaw -- after the first day or so, Taylor refuses to do 99% of what you tell him to do. Your choices don't have much effect. He'll just ignore you or stall until your decision is rendered pointless. He also has a absolutely no survival instant, so you're constantly trying to convince him not to roll over and die. The story is great and so is the writing -- you just don't have much influence over its direction.
uninstalled, After, days, After three days I uninstalled it. The game's premise is great, but Taylor is an idiot...seriously,..he is stupid beyond belief and that quickly gets annoying.  If Taylor were a 14 year old girl, it would be far more believable. There is nothing about his demeanor, dialog or decision making ability that would suggest that he is even remotely educated.   Also, the dialog feels more like he is simply narrating in real-time, which is counter intuitive to text messaging. At one point the messages were literally a play-by-play of him reaching for some food with a contraption he fashioned out of spare parts.   I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get past the physical gymnastics that are require to perform such a task, while apparently typing at the same time.   Also, the interaction between you and this moron is stupefying. It didn't take long before I began to dislike Taylor...a lot! He is a boorish mental midget who struggles with unbelievably simple decisions; like going clockwise or counter-clockwise.   Lastly, Taylor is not only stupid, but he is meek. Seriously, quit whining about your whittle sore shoulder and man up! What a candy ass.

I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get past the physical gymnastics that are require to perform such a task, while apparently typing at the same time.   Also, the interaction between you and this moron is stupefying. It didn't take long before I began to dislike Taylor...a lot! He is a boorish mental midget who struggles with unbelievably simple decisions; like going clockwise or counter-clockwise.   Lastly, Taylor is not only stupid, but he is meek. Seriously, quit whining about your whittle sore shoulder and man up! What a candy ass.
get, into, game, Interesting concept, but I wasn't able to get into this game as much as others have. During the initial playthrough I found myself a little impatient when the main character was off doing things like sleeping and not communicating with me. The thought of uninstalling it definitely crossed my mind during these prolonged downtime events. Also, I was very bothered by the unrealistic timing of the dialog. For example, there are times where the main character is in a panic and only has seconds to make a decision, yet he goes off on tangents and cracks jokes or tells side stories for the next minute or so. Lastly, I just wasn't able to really feel for the main character. I read many reviews before playing saying I should expect to really form a bond with the character. I honestly felt nothing the entire time. Game could be a little longer too.

cared, about, Taylor, Aw man this was awesome!! I really cared about Taylor, I actually cried when she got to safety. (First playthrough, no deaths, aw yeah!!) I mean, I read her as a "she", but the gender is never specified, so Taylor could be any gender, which is awesome! Sort of lets you put your own spin on the character. Loved the plot, loved the world- and character-building, loved the descriptions. The only thing that slightly frustrated me was not being able to input my own communications and having to pick options, but I understand that otherwise it would have been hellish/impossible to code. I guess really it works quite well because I started to get frustrated that I couldn't be more positive for Taylor, so I got really emotionally involved. Really great!

hear, from, Taylor, This is such a fantastic story! I've been so entrapped and excited to hear from Taylor! I don't typically do reviews for games, but if you're looking for a text adventure give this a try, it's totally worth it! I would for sure give more than 5 stars if I could.

go, through, story, Nice story. I could guess the ending from the path I choose, but I'll have to go through the story again to see if I can get a different ending.
got, to, ship, Dude. Killer game.... On day three I was on the edge of my chair. Loved it. Wished it had a few more choices... I think I could of got him to the ship easier.... Given the supplies I had. I did like how he fought against what I told him sometimes. Given his own moral...... compass..... Ehhhhh.... Downside I beat it first time... But frankly I believe it was from my choices... Got outta that cluster f. But seriously from a games... Of all types.... Best purchase I've made in a long while.

think, about, consequences, Great game that really makes you think about consequences.
detracts, from, game, Original real-time text based adventure. Enjoyed it a lot and a nice little story that's worth uncovering.  Amazing how delaying outcomes adds rather than detracts from the game.
reminds, of, choose, Brilliant game, reminds me of the choose your own adventure books I read as a kid.  The real time aspect where it takes time for the character to do things which makes it seem pretty realistic.

play, during, lecture, fun and great to play during lecture
ran, on, phone, It's a really cool way of delivering a story, and app ran perfectly on my phone. Most dialogue options only have one real option though and leads you to it. Sometimes you'll try to pick option B and be given an argument against it over and over til eventually it just says you're going to do option A. At one point this went for 4 attempts. Maybe there's other endings I missed but I tried replaying and picking the opposite choices only to find most of the time I was on the exact same track. Bit frustrating

Saved, on, run, Such a good game. Pulled me in really fast. Saved Taylor on my second run. Good for people who really get into their games. Love that I can continue the adventure afterwards too with a new story and not have to install a new app.

crashed, on, planet, It's a really cool premise-- you're in contact with a space explorer whose ship crashed on a planet. It's a choose your own adventure via conversations with them. It also takes place in "real time" meaning that you can't play the game all at once. The explorer will be "busy" and you could wait hours to hear from them. That made it feel more realistic. However, in certain threads of the gameplay, you will tell the explorer to do something and they will wind up doing whatever they want, which defeats the purpose of the game. Additionally, you could wait several hours for a reply only for it to be the explorer saying "I'm still alive can't talk!" And there isn't anything fun or interesting about the interaction and then you have to wait another several hours. Because of this I would say great premise, poor execution. Not really worth spending money on.

lasts, for, 2, It was an interesting game that lasted... Maybe 2 hours.. can get a better game that lasts longer than that for $2... Maybe worth $.50 imo since it was so short. It was mildly entertaining, not much detail in the story though.
relied, on, story, Takes me back to the old days when games relied on excellent story and writing to create drama. And this game is heavy on drama and suspense!
worked, on, Wear, Definitely grabs you attention, wish it would have worked on my Android Wear though.
attached, to, Taylor, Totally engrossing interactive story. In a very short space of time, I grew quickly attached to Taylor and got really anxious for his wellbeing on multiple occasions. Really fun experience. I want more.
wanted, to, game, Great story with a good sound track. I wanted to a game like this for sooo long.

felt, for, him, My first real-time text game. Taylor was engaging, smart, funny and you really felt for him/her. I liked the multiple possible endings and niggling that Taylor did and your choices did matter. An excellent entry. Thank you
cried, with, relief, I nearly cried with relief when I found out Taylor survived. I mean, I know it's just a game, but you have to understand... I (we) DID THIS ON MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH! I WAS SO STRESSED!  Devs: Fantastic story, wonderful game! I really loved Taylor's character. Just one thing, can you please remember to add a notification noise to the notifications for any future games? Thanks for the amazing time!

recommend, to, me, My boyfriend was actually the one to recommend this game to me and I'm hooked. The storyline is great, it's easy to play and Taylor can be so funny. I really like this game.
puts, in, hands, Lifeline, a unique game like no other i have played before. Lifeline isn't just a game, it's an experience, an experience you will not forget any time soon. Taylor, the character of the game puts her life in your hands as the story goes on. This game makes you one of the characters. As the game goes on Taylor asks you questions, and you have to make decisions that can cause a major to minor turning point in the game. These decisions are not always easy and I wish you luck.

purchasing, from, author, A good idea decently executed, however the occasional typos and improper grammar deter me from purchasing others from the series/developer/author. Given this works' focus on the written word, lax editing is inexcusable.
play, for, thing, No gameplay. Boring. Had to play for a "game appreciation" thing.
get, into, story, You fully get into the story loved these as a kid

Had, on, edge, Had me on the edge of my seat so often
Had, at, edge, Had me at the edge of my seat. Amazing game.
having, with, notifications, I am having trouble with notifications. The notifications pop up on my phone but there are no notification sounds. It isn't the settings of my S6. Does anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?

play, on, mode, A bit too short if you play it on fast mode. Kind of dull. Not bad but not good either
played, for, days, Honestly this was spectacular!  I loved every minute of this and I played for five days.  You really get attached to Taylor.  Usually I don't care for protagonist in games because I can just start over if they die, but for Lifeline I really thought over my options, and how they could effect Taylor's chances of survival.  It was SO worth my dollar.

remember, to, day, The original Lifeline. I've played this game long ago, but to this day I remember it being possibly the best experience I have ever from playing a mobile game. I would definitely recommend everyone even remotely interested in interactive stories to give this a try. Btw, the direct sequel to this here is Lifeline: Silent Night, which isn't as long or good as the original, but still something I would recommend playing if you liked this.
used, for, this, Several times you won't be able to read whole text. What kind of device developers used for this? Aren't they aware about limitations? It sucks
sent, through, messages, Really enjoyed taylors character whould have like if the app sent through messages without me needing to open it
sent, without, me, Really enjoyed taylors character whould have like if the app sent through messages without me needing to open it
recommend, In, all, I was initially wary about this game being entirely text based but the developers of the app did an amazing job at creating an interesting story and making a character that I felt really bad about when a decision I made eventually killed him.  In all I would recommend if you don't mind a tiny bit of reading.
played, in, time, This was definitely the most heartwrenching game I have ever played in a LOOOONG time. I actually came to know Taylor and become friends with him I feel like. I know it sounds weird but thats what this game does to you.....the ending gave me goosebumps or at least the ending that I got, definitely gave me goosebumps....this was too amazing and perfect in every way....going back in in a few days...need a break, I lost a good friend...

make, after, infinity, Love this game. Please make another Taylor saga (after infinity pls!)
cared, about, character, Well written and addictive. I really cared about the character and felt responsible for him. Loved it.
stuck, to, it, Love the concept. Got stuck to it in the first 10secs. I sometimes can't read the whole message (they are cut off at the bottom on N6P Android 8.0.0). Edit: at least in english they are. Not in German. O.o

downloaded, on, whim, I downloaded this on a whim and now Im totally hooked! So refreshing to play a "game" like this! The wait in between dialogue is tortuous in a good way! I find myself constantly checking my phone for the next notification of a message! I habe played through several times to explore all choices and see what the outcomes are. I will absolutely be purchasing the rest of the series. Please keep them coming!

install, on, Wear, It's great, but when I try to install it on my Wear 2.0 Moto 360, it gets stuck on installing.
communicating, with, astronaught, An amazing story. This is not a time killer game, its a peaceful game. It really makes you feel like you're Mission Control, communicating with an astronaught. The wait is part of the experience.  The only thing I don't like is the notification spam. You can get dozens of notifications at a time with this app. I would recommend a single notification like "New Transmission from Taylor" so you know when to go on the app.

got, to, peak, Absolutely amazing, I'm kinda sad, I got Taylor to the peak, but he died of an intense heart attack, but the rewind feature makes me less guilty.

Fall, in, love, Fall in love with the character. Great game.
played, in, time, This is a text based game. Story is compelling and engaging. I played through in 3 days time. I might replay it to explore alternate story lines.
cared, about, fate, A truly unique minimalistic story. I cared deeply about the fate of this character from beginning to end.

talking, about, what, This is an awesome game I am never disappointed people who say this is boring don't know what they are talking about and trust me you have to keep playing *Spoiler if you die you can make a different choice and get closer to finding out what comes next I've played all the others as well and I'm never disappointed 2017
love, at, times, This is an awesome game and I love the design, slightly limited options at times yet overall a true 5 star game
feel, for, character, Loved the.game. It has a captivating story that really makes you feel for the character and gives you choice on what happens. I do wish however that they would have explored more of Taylor's story, what he was doing on the Varia, what he is like, where he comes from. Also, sometimes Taylor's a butthead and he doesn't listen, which seems kinda like a cheap way to not write more story endings.

sit, in, front, I'm stil trying to save him but it's a great game! It doesn't let you sit in front of it the whole day, because you have to wait for his answers, I like that.

engaging, for, text, Very engaging for a text only game and uses very little memory space. Keeps you involved and immersive. Can be played in short time periods as it waits until you can return to it. Simple but imaginative.

typed, on, review, I had typed sooo much on the review but it deleted when I scrolled a little üòÇ So, in summary of what I said: Best game I've played in a looong time, love the emotion and drive through the story (well, at least MY version), and I'm still coursing with energy because Taylor and i made it on the first try! I loved it sooo much! The awesome thing is that not only can I play it again, but that there's more adventures for me and Taylor to experience üòâ Thank you so much for taking me on this EPIC experience! üòÇ

immersed, in, story, Amazing story, i git immersed in the story.
get, into, it, This is the first time I've ever played a game like this & I didn't think I'd really get into it but I did! I actually found myself wanting to hear back from "Cadet Taylor" & checking my notifications. I even went back to see what happens when I respond in different ways. Good game!! I'm off to play Lifeline: Silent Night now!

getting, of, games, Wow don't. Finally saved that slack ass moron. Is the writer that simple minded, or just the character? This is not a good cellphone game. This is not a time waster, this is a constant interruption over and over. Will NOT be getting anymore of these "games".
cut, in, messages, The text was cut off in several messages leaving me to guess what she said
annoying, with, notifications, I found it to be boring (and annoying with all the notifications)
Waiting, for, responses, Fantastic story. Waiting for responses was a cool feature.
brings, in, you, Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Taylor's personality is the right mix of snark and worry and humour and vulnerability. Really brings out the mother hen and best friend in you. So glad a friend recommended this game to me! (plus I've always been an absolute sucker for space and science - I enjoy Taylor's little geeking out sessions). As a plus point - T's gender is kept ambiguous, so you could imagine 'em to be anything.
brought, as, player, Arguably best indie game on Android (on par with Kingdom Rush).  The storytelling is genius. It brought me as a player so attached to Taylor. I felt like really need to help him out, to check him whenever he sent a message.  A breath of fresh air. Showed us story matters more than graphic.

recommend, to, anyone, It's a wonderful story that I'd recommend to anyone who likes text based games
Looking, to, adventure, Riveting story telling and Taylor is such a sweet and funny person that I would've been heartbroken if I got Taylor killed. I fortunately made the right moves but there was some pretty close calls! Looking forward to the next adventure.
died, from, inconveniences, This nerdy, non-mechanically inclined, city going intern has died so many times from minor inconveniences it makes me rage... 11/10 would rage play again
read, on, messages, I would give 5 stars but there is a glitch where i cant read all the text on long messages so that makes me miss alot of crucial information pls fix
rescue, on, try, Very compelling. Whenever Taylor would say "give me a minute" I would find myself waiting the whole minute. I managed to rescue him on the first try but the whole way I was sure he would not make it. I now on to the sequel....
goes, at, pace, Great story that goes at your pace, whatever it is. Notification is not intrusive and text only feels like books that let you shape your own adventure. A must play for sci-fi fans?

get, until, end, One of the best interaction story-choice based game I've ever played. I never get a chance to getting bored to processing until the end of the story since Taylor is a realistic and friendly character. And he just made me want to do my best to help him out the moon alive! Definitely going to purchase the other two games of these &lt;3
formed, of, opinion, Nowhere near completed the game but definitely loving it. The story writing is humorous and descriptive, which is great since this it exclusively text based. I like that Taylor has already formed somewhat of an opinion by the time you're forced to make a selection and will either agree or disagree with your choice, which is realistic and adds credibility to the character. Moreover, Taylor is extremely likable and that makes the experience much more enjoyable. Money well spent, indeed.

happen, during, pauses, The story with all its elements of science fiction and classic horror really keeps you enthralled amd wamting to know what's going to happen next during the pauses in story.  I've played through this twice already and can honestly say each of those two endings are unique enough to make you want to replay, but still in keeping with the story as a whole.

consists, of, stories, I love love love this game. It is the best game I have ever played.  Only problem is its short. Maybe you could have something happen on the escape pod  and we can keep going. Edit: the lifeline series currently consists of 7 stories, all costing $3 each. Maybe have a bundle/season pass thing for cheaper, or at least group similar characters together, like the 3 stories with Taylor.

associated, with, adventures, While beautifully‚Äã executed, it lacks the depth usually associated with text-adventures. The story is predictable‚Äã and only 2 options per choices available.  The idea of waiting, notifications etc is a good one, but the game builds on it too much without providing anything truly substantial.

went, into, it, Definitely get it before you consider otherwise. Amazing game, concept is great, and I can only imagine how much work went into it. DEFINITELY worth it!
put, in, game, Realy you put ads in a paid game? Please, don't do it.
Finished, in, days, I love choice games. Played a bunch, but none quite like this. Finished it in three days, and though there were times I was screaming at the character to finish breakfast faster or whatever, the time aspect was what gave this game an added sense of realism. For three days, my family has been asking for updates on my "spaceman". The story is great, the gameplay is great, A++.

helping, along, way, I absolutely love these games!   I love being these characters lifeline!   I love learning who Taylor is, helping him along the way. He's fun, he's so sweet and interesting to talk to in itself. Even without the interesting plot, I just enjoy talking to Taylor.   The plot is interesting too.   What I love the most is the game style. Looking forward to many more games!!! It's rare that I buy a game. It's even rarer that I buy every game they have on option!!

He's fun, he's so sweet and interesting to talk to in itself. Even without the interesting plot, I just enjoy talking to Taylor.   The plot is interesting too.   What I love the most is the game style. Looking forward to many more games!!! It's rare that I buy a game. It's even rarer that I buy every game they have on option!!

lying, to, customers, Choices you pick don't even matter, tell her 4 times to do one thing, she does the opposite. Seriously devs? Stop lying to customers. UPDATE: Again told her to do something 3 times still didn't do it. Are you kidding me? This game is a lie.
feel, like, events, Great adventure in what feel like real time events. It's not a fast game, it's not a make your own adventure..you are a guide to a very unfortunate space traveller. For the money it's worth it.
played, like, isolation, I wish there was some console form of this game and played like alien isolation, that would be outstanding
killed, though, üòõ, It's good but please make the others cheaper because I can't afford it otherwise it's awesome I did it first try nearly killed him though üòõ
seems, like, day, Really interesting game. But I wish it was more nerve wrecking like I want to feel how much trouble hes in. There humor in this game and the way he talks just kind seems like its another day for him. And some of the dialogue was pretty "corny",and "cheesy". But overall if you have the time its pretty good to waste time on.

waiting, for, sucks, Surprisingly really immersive. It's initially boring and waiting around for the next message sucks, but I would say by the time you hit Taylor's first night on the moon it's starts getting good, and keeps getting better and better until the end. I give it a 5/7, perfect score.

played, in, minutes, I bought this game sorta to be a time waster but in the few minutes I've played it has been very immersive. Just like talking to a person.

integrates, with, life, I'm getting tired of hack n slash and p2w games that require excessive screen time. This game integrates with daily life so well. Pick up the story whenever, and let your imagination do the rest!
bonded, to, character, Fun and incredibly addictive! Very atmospheric and I felt like I was there. I also felt so bonded to the character and will almost miss our chats in space. Worth the money.

write, to, story, Amazing game. Fun and write a bit of depth to the story.
cheering, on, Taylor, Just... incredible. I was cheering on Taylor the whole time. Very exciting toward the ending too.
go, into, mode, Good game, but why can't you go into fast mode? The waiting times are soooooo long
care, about, character, It has been more than a year since I first played this, and the story seems to have developed quite a bit! It is a fantastic adventure and you really (surprisingly) start to care about the character, his choices, your choices and his survival! Gripping story played out over a couple of weeks for me. Well worth the money.

paid, for, this, Story is mediocre. Player options are very limited. I can't believe I paid for this..... I suppose it's a little more engaging than scrolling through Facebook.

recommend, for, people, I absolutely love this game and I have just finished it. I highly recommend it for other people!
dies, for, time, I've been playing it a bit and it has a nice storyline and is very interesting. I just finished the game and its very interesting. And when Taylor dies for the first time (based on what you tell her to do) then you unlock fast mode which means no waiting. You also unlock the ability to rewind the story to any point, day, or question and then change your answer to the question as well.

emerges, into, gameplay, This game is a bit slow, but honestly it's better that way. It emerges you into the gameplay so well your on the edge of your seat waiting to see what Taylor does next.
looks, like, what, That will be great if i can get the art what taylor looks like it, and capt. Colby, and the rest of the crew, and valvara . i think it must be epic if there any short clip about the ending when taylor running tripping, deepresd, and then crying when he got disconnecting sytem message with player .

enjoyed, for, time, I enjoyed the simplicity of the game and the waiting time. The options could be developed better with probing questions but for a first time Thom rough it I enjoyed it.
make, like, it, Awesome presentation!! Outstanding game!! Please make more like it!!
move, to, one, Unlike any other game that I have played, and it was brilliant. Will now move to the next one!
attached, to, character, Thr story line had me hooked the entire time! You cannot help but get attached to the character
add, in, timer, Great but if you could add in a timer for when hes done being "busy" then ill give a 5 star review
waiting, for, message, Great story waiting for next message can be a bit tedious but all in all worth the money recommend for people who like using their imagination

survive, from, beginning, So good. The dialog is a bit cheesy at times but I love the suspense. And I want Taylor to survive from the beginning of the story. Good job with pacing the game. It keeps you in suspense without being too long to wait. Here is to many more hours saving Taylor!

investing, in, chapters, great game with lots of tension, comedy and ticks along at a good pace. will definitely be investing in the next chapters
add, to, experience, Great, creative story with interaction points all along the way. The delays seem cumbersome sometimes, but they also add a dimension of reality to the experience the first time. A truly interesting, involved game that leaves you checking for notifications whenever you grab your phone!üÜí

Felt, like, Taylor, Good story. Felt like Taylor was a real person. Pretty stressful at times. Great stuff.
compete, with, it, 5 stars in every field. Great, great game in every aspect with a FANTASTICALLY written story, and not many can compete with it. Made me a fan of this kind of games and of this developer in particular. Also some great replayability value because of the different endings and a useful fast mode once you completed the story (skips all the waiting). 10/10.
became, to, me, To create a worthwhile interactive text based game, essentially all you need is to pay attention to is spelling, grammar, and punctuation, while offering an engaging storyline. What really became the deal breaker to me for this title was the unnecessarily too realistic wait times for the story's character to respond back to you. I get enough of that type of disappointment from real life texting. :(

written, with, character, Well written with a likeable character. This is a purchase that I don't regret.
play, for, months, I didn't play the game for a few months but when I had the chance to play it and got into it I loved it so thank you for this amazing game and story.

Riveting, from, beginning, Riveting from beginning to end. Amazing storytelling, engaging story, and so many twists, you're never sure of what's happening. This is an amazing "game" that is unique in it's type. It was worth every penny and I am sorry to see the story end. I cannot wait for more!!!

stretch, to, max, It's good. First and foremost: it's good. But is it 2 euros good, that is the question. You get about 18 hours of gameplay but 90% of that is waiting time. That's my one issue: it's just so darn short. Even if you stretch out the story to its max, it's not much. What there is of it is awesome but it would have been nice if it'd lasted two days at least.

Reminds, of, games, Really fun and unique game. Reminds me of my old text based adventure games
liked, in, day, I liked text adventures back in the day. This is a multiple choice tree-structured story rather than the type using objects and verb-noun commands. Good concept though. You play in spurts of just a few minutes with waiting time between. Good for fighting boredom while waiting for trains.

ramping, with, mystery, At first it's a slow start. However it starts ramping up with mystery. It is definitely worth getting.
coming, from, which, I think I found the source from which all the similar games are coming from! Neddless to say a whole new type of game which simply NEEDS a sequel!
engaging, as, book, Fantastic game in real time, more or less.  It didn't take forever but it was as engaging as any book.  Fun for the low cost.
played, in, time, Wow. Just... wow, I've never played a game like this in real time and it has, by far the best story I have ever read.
reminded, in, cases, An amazing text-based adventure. Powerful story with a good sense of humour which‚Äîin some cases‚Äîreminded me of The Martian novel. Highly recommended!

recommend, to, anyone, Amazing story and lovable character with awesome, realistic interaction. I highly recommend the Lifeline series to anyone who loves a good story!!
forced, in, choices, Decent story but honestly really forced in the choices. Not a fan of the twist as well but I'm sure others would like it
hooked, from, start, Holy cow this had me hooked from the start!
Loved, about, it, Awesome game. Thrilling. Loved everything about it. Very immersive experience. I'm gonna buy the next one.
immersed, in, story, This game truly immersed me in the story, I actually became worried about Taylor when I didn't hear from her. It's an amazing game with great story telling, and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I'm 100% addicted to this gave and it's sequels.

working, on, Watch, Cool but is not working on my Huawei Watch :(
focuses, on, story, It's an amazing game that truly focuses on on the story
worked, to, ending, Recently purchased and just worked through to the ending. Great game with the "realtime" structure creating a good sense of drama and led to regular checks of my phone to aeeif anything had happened.  Only time the concept showed a small flaw were the time critical parts of the story where suspense was built up suggesting Taylor had only a few minutes to make a decision but I could wait hours to make my call. Clearly the limits of such a game prevent anything other than this but there could be an odd occasion thrown in where Taylor chased you for a decision to add to the feeling of urgency.  Definitely recommended though.

making, at, point, Good game, though the jokes seem repetitive way too much making them not funny at one point. especially the meters jokes.
intertwined, with, story, A clever game mechanic intertwined with an excellent story.
Addicting, as, hell, Addicting as hell
helping, through, journey, I love this game so much! I loved helping Taylor through the journey, and managed to finish it on my 2nd attempt! (After accidentally rewinding it) anyway, I am definately recommending this to   friends!! I absolutely love the sci-fi and some of it freaked me out, but in an awesome way!!! Totally worth the money.

flies, after, update, The game is loads of fun but now new permissions like access to my media flies after a bug fix update and no explanation for the permissions in the description prevent me from even thinking about updating. Game so far is 5 stars but the other I mentioned....

immerses, in, story, Lifeline is different from any other game on the app store markets it immerses you in the story, makes you acountable for the choices that are made makes you believe that you are Taylor's only chance at survival, and I love it.
paid, for, game, I paid for this game and now you put ads in?
Made, to, end, Made it to the end and I'm rightly thrilled and anxious to see what happens next...best 99 cents I ever spent... Fast forward about 2 years and I found the game in my app list and played it again only to find out theres a lot more sequels. I loved the preview and just bought the second game. Here's to another adventure with Cadet Taylor
seems, for, cost, I love playing this game it always seems to lure me back, plus for the cost you get a full great game
kill, during, flights, A nice way to kill time during layovers and business trip flights.
carry, between, games, Taylor's stories are the best written by miles. Only thing missing is that the story should carry over between games of the same series, akin to Mass Effect, Telltale Games etc.
Grew, with, adventures, Superb. Saved Taylor on 1st attempt. Grew up with text adventures and thoroughly enjoyed it. Had a book when I was young called The Warlock of Firetop Mountain in which you choose scenarios to influence the ending, so brought back good memories of the genre. This is very well written and engaging. Bought next installment. Also tempted to go back and make some really bad decisions just to see what happens lol. Please keep the installments going :-)

need, on, watch, I need this on my smart watch to give 5 start rating so work on in it please
getting, of, games, Why do you suddenly need access to loads off things with the last update. Im not updating it. And i won't be getting anymore of yr games if you need to be that noisey.
going, after, days, I like CYOA games, and this one sounded interesting and got decent ratings, but after a couple days into the game, still not much more going on other than deciding to eat breakfast or review some video (that is, the character watches, not you, this IS text based, after all). There really isn't much to do other than wait for long stretches, with occasional mundane choices, and Taylor isn't a very interesting character. Ultimately, found Lifeline to be plodding and tiresome. Uninstalled.

Feeling, of, involvement, Story, great. The way it works, great. Atmosphere, great. Feeling of involvement, great. But latest update requires loads of new permissions, bad. Can't even see why. Sorry but time to uninstall.
stuck, in, blizzard, A lot of fun. It'd be cool if there were other scenarios, like stuck in a blizzard, or on the side of the mountain, etc. A ton of potential.
talking, to, you, This game was a recommendation by a friend. It's beautifully CYOA-TYPE story is more than I expected. It was compelling, even a bit surreal. The developer/writer really made it seem like it was a real person talking to you. Every conversation was fluid and your choices really were your choices. Whether Taylor lives or dies depends on you as a player, but more than that. Almost as if you were a friend across the eons looking out for him when he has no one.

worked, into, it, I'm not a fan of text based games (someone told me to try it), but the story is gripping and well written. Plus it has a "picobuttload" of comedy worked into it. Well worth every penny. Try this game.
fell, in, love, I fell in love with the lifeline series since this game came out. I wasn't into interactive text based stories before, but this game made a great impression. Interesting storyline and a lovable protagonist. Do recommend!!
talking, to, person, I love how the time delays make it feel like you're really talking to a person. This game is very addictive and very good, I very highly recommend it. It is completely worth the few dollars it costs.
asks, in, permissions, Very intriguing and well done. However the new update asks for in app purchase permissions even though the description system no in app purchases...
got, in, panic, Well that was fun! Very creative. It actually got me in a panic at times, worried over poor Taylor.

read, as, child, Nice idea, and reminded me of the "Choose your own adventure" books I read as a child. Once it's done, though, that's it... I lost, I won... Not sure that's worth the money. Oh well.
invested, in, survival, Words cannot describe how happy I am that I bought this game. I just finished the first play through and I was completely invested in Taylors survival the entire time. I really liked that the astronaut had a gender ambiguous name so you can imagine Taylor as a boy or girl. After you beat the game you can backtrack and see what would have happened had you fail. Perfect. I loved stressing out over this game. (Taylor survived my first play.)

engrossed, in, story, Exciting. I actually found myself so engrossed in the story I was waiting on his responses so I could continue and see what happened next. Now I need to replay so I can make different choices!

capture, like, this, I enjoyed the heck out of this! It is not usual that a game would capture my attention like this but I kept thinking about Taylor over the last almost a week I played this. Even my parents got into it, asking how she was doing and making the decisions with me. I am so excited to play the rest of the games!!! Taylor was a lot of fun to talk to and felt very real. She reminded me of a friend of mine actually. Same sense of humour. Overall it is worth way more than 2.69$ for the entertainment I got!

seems, like, game, At first, it starts off slow and seems like the average AI game. Then as the days progress and you wait for more messages, it slowly becomes more and more realistic. You catch yourself pending hard on decisions as they are life or death for your new found friend. Original and oddly intense for such a slow game. I would definitely recommend it.

tied, to, time, A choose your own adventure type story, but tied to real time for an interesting sense of immersion and anticipation. Takes about three days to play, has multiple endings.

feel, for, character, Great story. Really makes you feel for the main character
presents, in, way, This game presents itself in an interesting way and I actually like how there are time gaps built in. It helps build tension and realism. Gonna try the sequel now!
communicating, with, someone, I love the concept of having to wait real time, though others may not. It really feels as though you're communicating with someone, who only has you to talk to and it makes you really care about this person. It's great that it takes time to create this connection, that later on, you really care about this person's well-being and your choices affect that. I did make some bad decisions at first, but it just makes you want to come back, and think about better decisions. Awesome job.

got, as, something, I got this as something to play on my smart watch and by the end I was deeply drawn into the character, concerned for his wellbeing and feeling impact over every decision that I'd made. Very well done, would definitely recomend

spending, on, app, I'm pretty cheap comma, so spending any money on an app is a big deal for me. At first, it's interesting and entertaining, but the story feels relatively short and gets too drawn out at the end.

finished, for, time, I just finished this for the second time after downloading all 6 of the games and it is just as awesome as before
fit, into, days, A new age interactive fiction, deceptively drawing you in, uncannily believable and beautifully written. Excellent pacing and it fit really well into my days. Took two/three to complete. Slow bursts at first, but what a finale. Holy crap, so SO well done. What a hell of an ending. I wish there were more ways of responding, but I don't see how you could do that without sacrificing the smoothness of game play. Best little game I've played in a while. I'll absolutely be getting the rest.

Hats, to, you, Love the game. Brings me back to the old text adventures! Good job! Hats off to you!
comes, in, waves, Great Story! its like a book you cant put down. And since it comes in waves like a text or real communication. I felt more immersed. everytime I saw the notification. I was like "Taylor responded" lol Great concept!
attached, to, characters, I love this entire game series! The concept is amazing, and in my opinion, the actual product is just as amazing! I love the story, and I grew so attached to the characters! It felt like they were real, like I was actually talking to Taylor.

spiraling, on, scenarios, I spent a couple days being legitimately worried for the main character. I found my self thought-spiraling on scenarios and possible outcomes. This game is delivered very well and the writing draws a reader in easily. This is exactly the kind of alternative to normal Mobile games that I need!
blows, like, girlfriend, This condescending character makes everything harder and blows up your phone like a jealous insecure girlfriend.. you give him advice and he still does exactly what you told him not to do.. frankly this game is a waste of time and stress on people with actual problems in life. It's not fun to have a what seems to be an uneducated man with no hope on the other end of your screen. He doesn't listen and it's always something (even if it's his doing) simply unrealistic game
choose, for, play, The writing is cheeky and the plot is very sci-fi. I was able to choose correctly for my first play through.
play, through, times, Enjoying this. Gets better when you play through multiple times , making new choices etc.
run, on, phone, Having an asynchronous visual novel run on the phone and message you via notifications is pretty neat. Wish it were longer, but then for the price it's also quite worth it. Update: Considering all the later entries, this one does it by far the best with it's comparatively long gaps between interaction and mostly autonomous character - it just feels more believable. Taylor is walking around doing things, we're only helping as needed.

care, for, him, This game does a good job with the dioluage. The character actually has character and makes us care for him. The game also does a good job of making it seem like we are actually talking to someone stranded on a room. The story is mysterious and keeps you guessing. You are always wanting to figure out what's going to happen. I wish there was more parts where you have to research something in real life. I really liked that, but it only happens once. And the ending was kind of sudden(I know there are multiple)

directing, around, planet, Finally downloaded this story and I am not disappointed. It is fun "directing" the sole survivor of a crash   around a derelict planet. Well worth the two bucks!
caring, about, character, Love these games! Bit weird caring so much about a fictional character though üòÑ
Choose, from, variety, Lifeline is an enthralling story with an exciting adventure! Choose from a variety of options as you progress through this story! Aid your friend hundreds of thousands of miles away in surviving a strange mind twisting adventure. This tale will have you on the edge of your seat for days! Taylor has a wonderful personality and you will not easily forget about him. I have  to get the sequels! This isnt really my genre when it comes to games but it's certainly captured my heart!

care, for, Taylor, "Are you okay? Please be okay. " I am only a short while into this and I am already concerned and care for Taylor. The above quotes have been heard by family members as I mutter them to myself. I keep picking up my phone just in case I missed a communication. This is a fantastic way of immersing someone in a game. If you want a chose your own adventure type game, except for the fact you are guiding someone, but one that has something different to add to the game type, this is it. Gotta go, communication...

talking, to, character, This is more than worth it, and once you play one, you're beyond hooked. Getting a new message from whichever character you're talking to is always thrilling and the connection you feel to them is insane. Fantastic series, can't wait for more on Taylor.

impress, in, fashion, Quite an amazing game! Normally I am not one for rating any sort of app, as few impress me in any concrete fashion, but this game was honestly excellent and deserves the five stars!
jump, at, night, I forgot if the app was free or if i paid a couple bucks, but it was worth it either way. The story was very nicely done. I'd jump in at night before bed so it gave me something to look forward to at bedtime, kinda sad its over.

waiting, for, decision, Good game but very banter heavy for a person stranded off world. It took me out of it a lot of the time waiting for next decision. Good game otherwise.
cared, about, Taylor, Best game ever. I really cared about Taylor and always hoping I won't get him hurt or killed. Continued with Silent night and again, masterpiece. Waiting for next Taylor lifeline game!

let, In, order, I like text based adventures but this one has one BIG flaw. In order to increase "immersion" they let you wait... In real time - all the time sometimes it's only one question you can answer before "Taylor is busy" again. This was so annoying that I lost interest.
wait, for, responses, I couldn't wait for the responses from Taylor, I've downloaded the rest of the games and I'm hooked. Starts to feel really life like. Sometimes I'd forget to message real people back but I'd go the extra effort to respond to the latest messages. Whiteout was my personal favourite. So good.

hoped, for, more, I really hoped for more, but in the end I just thought the biggest let down was the story and narrative. There is so much rambling on and waffling that I just got bored of waiting for something to happen. The responses/questions that you could give Taylor were also limited that at times it felt very frustrating engaging in this fictional conversation.

go, through, it, It's definitely a gripping "game" especially if you go through it real time. Unfortunately I turned on the fast mode because I managed to get the protagonist killed on the first night. I didn't want to wait through the same night. Well, I ended up playing the whole story in fast mode and realized the playable minutes of this game is less than 2 hours. You can replay it if you want but it kinda loses it's appeal when you know what's gonna happen.

paying, for, game, I was,skeptical at first, paying a dollar for a mobile game, but I haven't even finished the game yet and I'm already satisfied with it, definitely worth a $1 and its a great story so far, immersive  and its actually cool getting messages from Taylor with new questions and situationsüëç great job on this! I'd love to see more like it from the same creators

stick, to, games, Normally I stick to the free games on here, but I saw this game mentioned on tumblr and it's totally worth it, the story is suspenseful and I am totally looking forward to playing again so I can see what happens with the other choices.

hang, for, long, Really failed to engage. Didnt enjoy the sarcasm and silly answers. Sounds like it gets better reading some other reviews, but didn't really want to hang around for that long... It was becoming like an annoying friend messaging you.

say, like, this, It's a sifi-mind fŒº¬©{er just keep playing and you will find out why I say it like this
waiting, for, observation, I realise that I'm in the minority here but really why do Americans think sarcastic bantering is funny? I'm over waiting for another "witty" observation. A game like this is about dialogue and it just doesn't work. I don't find it believable that such a character would be in this situation. But I guess it's just me.
thinking, about, Taylor, Very unique way to tell a choose-your-own-adventure story.  I was thinking about Taylor whenever I couldn't check on him at work.  Glad I gave it a try and I'll definitely try the others.

The only drawbacks for me were the limited pathways and the short plotline. But the story was good nonetheless. WARNING: This is a choice game in which you wait for notifications after your choices (i.e., immersion factor).

looking, at, phone, This game was my introduction to the genre. I give it five stars for giving me an opportunity to play something entirely different. I kept looking at my phone to see if I had any communications pending.
hooked, at, start, I got hooked at the start,really good game.Recomended
tries, In, any, I really can't this guy's writing. In any of these lifelines the dialogue tries way to hard to be personable and charming with annoying drawn out dialogue.

hanging, on, phone, Great, now I'm hanging on my phone, begging Taylor for updates. I am way too attached.

feel, like, someone, This game/App thing is well worth the 1 dollar. I actually feel like someone out there is talking to me and I'm helping him/her. Also its amazing how what 1 differ text can change the whole story to fast paste or slow paste. The first time my astronaut froze to death ;-; I'm getting further but it's moving alot faster now that I changed up the beginning. I hope that for all of you that found this review helpful and support this game and hopes that this game will expand and hopefully make sequels and so-on

answer, to, him, The storyline didn't grab me, but maybe that's because I'm an avid reader and simple plotlines like this seem a little dull. I'd prefer more options but oh well. What really annoyed me though was the constant stream of notifications I got at once (I'm playing on slow-paced!). I would love the option to disable notifications, time how often I get them or at least only put one saying that Taylor had responded and you needed to answer to him/her (I think it's a her). I hate the fact that the story seems to only give you one direction it wants you to go‚Äîif you go an incorrect path, he/she's constantly telling you if you're sure or that he/she thinks otherwise. I've tested this out several times on several different places and I always die when I stick with said path of him/her telling me to not choose that path. Then there is also the fact that all the responses are so similar! For example, I've read the words 'Are you okay?', 'What happened?', 'Are you sure...' more than a hundred times! It's irritating when you only have those two responses after his/her long chunks of speech. I didn't hate it, though I didn't like it either. I tried to make this  constructive

played, for, minutes, played it for about 5 minutes and cant get a refund...
done, to, death, Nice concept with the real time text message system. Storyline is tired and has been done to death. I was able to predict the entire story after five interactions. One and done

meet, in, games, Where it all began hopefully we get to meet Taylor again in the future Lifeline games
turned, towards, end, Excellent game. Although I have to admit that I turned on fast mode towards the end because I couldn't stand the suspense :) Highly recommended, especially if you like reading books. It's like one of those, except that in real time AND you get to change the outcome!

continues, with, option, I found the character annoying and the choices often  seemed to be trivial. Also the odd loop where the story continues with the alternative option once your choice has scrolled through. I would enjoy it more if there were more significant choices to make and the character waffled on less.

go, for, days, This game feels too short. The only reason it would go for 2+ days is that sometimes you have to wait several RL hours for the game to advance. The story is not very good but it is also not bad.
Choose, on, smartphone, Choose Your Own Adventure, on your smartphone. Easy to play a little at a time, if you want to immerse yourself in the "real time" concept, or you can forego that altogether and play it as a CYOA book, all in one go.

seemed, to, point, At first it seemed kinda cute, a fun little CYOA but the more that I played, the more I got genuinely invested, to the point that I was getting worried about my decisions. Very well made and well worth it.
connected, to, Taylor, Its easy to get connected to Taylor. Seeing how you have to wait for him/her to respond, making it feel as though theres a real person there. It makes beating the game all the more fun

had, at, reference, You had me at the Upright Citizens Brigade reference. Oh also this game is awesome.
telling, in, format, Flawless story telling in a great format, Taylor will feel like a friend by the end, and that's when you know they've done a good job

look, for, what, Interesting game concept. Its not what I really look for in a game because you can't sit and play it for longer than 10 minutes at a time, but the concept of playing in real time is clever and quite well done. It's good at being what it is, but it wasn't really for me.

attached, in, this, This game is incredible, I've got more attached in this then some triple A games, highly recommend.
Starts, as, meh, Starts off as a little meh. But keep going. It will engage you!
played, through, it, In truth, It's more than just a game... it's an experience. Gamers and non gamers alike will enjoy it. I only played through it once but I found it genuinely interesting. It starts off a bit slow but it really picks up towards the end. I actually started to develop a connection with Taylor and I felt responsibility for having him/her killed. Anyways, great game! I think I'm going to replay it so that I can get a better ending.

played, to, endings, I played to 3 different endings so I didn't get bored. More scary space stories please
enjoyed, with, Taylor, That was so much fun, I've really enjoyed my time with Taylor over the last few days, uncovering the mysteries and making tough calls. Totally recommended.

leading, to, death, got him killed. dammit. actually feeling sorry for leading him to his death. i'm in Day 3 and so far the story has been engrossing and very well paced. unexpectedly funny in a good way and witty with just the right dose of sarcasm. takes quite a chunk of RAM but it's worth it. so okay, no more playing around Taylor, this time i mean business!
eat, at, time, Loved the concept, I really enjoyed the fact that your not so much "playing" so it does not eat away at your time. It was genuingly interesting to play. Would recommend it to anyone

asks, for, help, I love how Taylor asks you for your help and support with all Taylor's decisions because ot makes it alot more life like and I personally like how it is in real time and I do not care that I don't have much playing time... It just makes it even more realistic!!
felt, like, it, Holyshit finally i finished this game after i died thousands times ! But after all it's been a fantastic game !!  I felt super happy unspeakable ! When taylor survived.those three days was the longest days in he's live he felt like it three years!but were not only the longest days for taylor was also the longest days in my live.

add, to, game, Good storytelling and great atmosphere add up to the best game ever
played, on, Android, This is one of the best games I ever played on Android. That's probably because I don't usually enjoy computer games and because this isn't a usual computer game either. I would rather call it an interactive book where you make decisions on how the story should continue. Thus it's really not for fans of traditional games but might be interesting for people who don't usually play (like me) and especially for book lovers.

carry, through, play, An interesting attempt to modernize interactive fiction, through pseudo-realtime messaging, this game is a must try. The novelty alone should definitely carry you through your first play through. The only complaint I have is that the main character seems a bit too passive, but I suppose that is why you are guiding her about. Overall, an excellent game.
mixed, with, game, This is a bit like a choose your own adventure story, mixed with an adventure style game. I love the real time aspect of it and kept looking forward to seeing when Taylor would get back to me.
played, for, hours, The fact that I can interact and give choices and it impacts the story is awesome I've only played for a few hours but I really feel like I'm part of the story, great story, I will definitely be purchasing the sequels... Great job Devs!!!
play, from, watch, 1st being able to play the game from a android watch is awesome... The story is great, like a "choose your own adventure" book... but what's awesome is the main character will communicate with you at random times as he's busy... sometimes you will wait hours to hear back which makes it feel like hes actually performing the tasks he's talking about in real life... very cool

weaves, in, chunks, This game weaves a great tale, in casual/bite-sized chunks, for those of us who want narrative without five minute cut scenes. Simple (not easy) and comfortable execution. Great work!

trapped, in, planet, The story is great it feels so real but I wish there was a way to actually get to know the character, I mean the real character that isn't trapped in an unknown planet but putting that aside the game is great! I totally recommend it and it's worth your money üòå
call, for, phone, I call it best game for your phone
Had, at, edge, Had me at the edge of my seat the entire way, can't wait to play the sequel!

choose, in, android, Such a great story. Mystery and thriller, in an android choose your own adventure, what's not to love? All the people complaining"boring" "it's not a game it's a book". "If you want to be bored, just read a book".. Its an interactive choose your own adventure game/story. Seriously, don't you even bother to look at the screen shots? Anyway, great game. Is recommend it to anyone who likes to read,

moved, to, card, Very well written.   I played white out first and liked it so much I went back to try the first one.   As with the other holding one star off all because a game like this should be able to be moved to your SD card most others are.  This adds up space.   Any game should be move able to SD card without root as far as I'm concerned.   Other then that I highly recommend this entire series.   Thanks for the great games.
get, at, night, This game was awsome loved the story but when ur a kid u get really scared specially at night the music üëèüëèüëçüëç
Completed, after, 3days, Completed it after 3days of play,  wish it could have been a little longer
Look, to, one, Amazing story & writing. Look forward to next one!
reminded, of, games, I love this game. It reminded me of the text based computer games in the 80's when I was just a kid. The scene from the moive, 'Big' where he is playing a game of this genre popped into my mind.

making, At, Taylor, At first Taylor was really making me angry. "Listen kid just shut up and do what I tell you too!" However nearing the end of the story the intensity and the action really picked up and I couldn't help but to root for the little science nerd. Will be buying the other games in this series. 3 Minute Games have a customer for life.

reading, through, books, A brave choice, to pursue such a unique game design. I feel that it went off perfectly. I feel like I'm playing a slightly more immersion choose your own adventure game like Zork or reading through the old goosebumps books.
