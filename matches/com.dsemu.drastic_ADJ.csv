emulator, good, This was a good emulator but since Android screwed up the ability for emulators to read SD cards in the phones this app is completely useless! Paid for an app I can't use......
features, many, So many great features, it's crazy how good it runs. Gets updated frequently enough. Excellent :)

causes, known, Incompatible with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2. Some animation sequences always crash the game, known causes below (these are repeatable): Casting thunder magic on 3+ targets.

versions, newer, If it works, it's the best out there. However, it can't find the file structure on newer android versions. I can't recommend it until that's fixed

states, save, You can play games but The save states don't seem to work. So basically pointless especially if you want to play Pokemon.
storage, internal, Can't read as card and it screwed everything up when I transferred my games to my sd card. Even after transferring them back to internal storage it was still screwed up and wouldn't read them.
complaint, only, works p well! controls function properly. my only complaint is that the controls take up a HUGE amount of the emulated touchscreen space. if you're playing a game with touchscreen commands, especially timed ones, you're v likely to fail because the screen is hidden by the controls. this is *partially* fixed if you use a stylus for your phone, but not entirely. if i was using a tablet or even a larger phone, this would probably be *perfect*.

game, new, When I go to load new game, it takes me to an empty /storage and there's nothing else I can do
closing, lid, Worth the price, runs without issues with built in features like lid closing, microphone or touchscreen, requires almost no configuration and zero technical knowledge to setup properly.

android, last, After the last android update this app can't find rom in device so please fix permission for this app
storage, scoped, A bit broken on Android 11. Can then only read from INTERNAL STORAGE, not SD card due to "scoped storage". Other than that works flawlessly.

controller, external, Works well for me. I have a 2018 honor phone and a Samsung SD card. Also a 2017 Fire 10 tablet. Brilliant for puzzle, card & board games. Being able to swap screen position and move the on-screen keyboard around makes my games very playable. I did notice lag on one game, but all the others I play have been fine so far. Also loving the save/load game state. Makes games even more playable! Haven't tried with an external controller yet. Will update review if I manage to try.
period, Best, Best ds emulator period. can play both homebrews and original games no problem, plays 60fps smooth as silk. has tons of customization options, and you can switch between roms effortlessly.

deal, bad, The emulator doesn't want to scan games and it won't let me open folders manually. I am using Samsung Galaxy A20s. Please solve this problem, i was playing fine almost a month ago, reinstalling doesn't fix the problem. Paying in indonesian Rupiah is worth a month of meals here, so It's a bad deal to be paying for an app that doesn't work. I'd consider changing the rating if this bug is fixed because DraStic was one of the better DS emulator next to No$.

games, 3ds, Works and runs amazing just wish I could play 3ds games and multi-player
time, same, The controls seems quite buggy to me, base on my experience while playing some games, triggering 2 or 3 buttons at the same time they're not functioning correctly ...
games, 3ds, It should be able to emulate 3ds games when it can I'll give it 5 stars for sure.
emulator, good, It's a good emulator and does what it says. I have a major problem with the controls though. This doesn't happen with the Dpad but but the A and B keys keep getting pressed all the bloody time. No matter how big i make them/ move them around or even have it on Landscape. Can we customize the buttons fully to be able to move each one? A slight move further apart will fix this simple problem... Phone is a Samsung S8 EDIT: No longer works with android 11

emulator, coolest, Easily the coolest and most feature-rich emulator I know. I don't typically trust a lot of paid emulators since I'm from the FOSS world of doing things but I'm glad to say that I had nothing to worry about. It's well worth it.

folder, single, App doesn't allow navigation of folders AT ALL. Displays a single folder with '..' even after creating a user and specifying a directory, which doesn't even show games outside of a folder. Pure garbage.

emulators, free, I've tried a few of the free emulators, and this one rides a Ferrari. The others I've tried are riddled with ads and seem to be poorly optimized or purposely slowed down. Can't wait to play some childhood classics
app, Great, Great app, works perfectly on my phone no issues, I have an acer spin 311 chromebook, however, that I cannot get it to run on at all, It will not load most of the games I have with one exception as far as I"ve tested, it will run spirit tracks, that is all. currently wont even load up any of the games in my folders but only on my chromebook. I've gone so far as to extract the roms myself to no avail. Maybe my chromebooks too lowend Idk
game, saved, Keep crushing every time I load the saved game
emulator, 3ds, Can you work on 3ds emulator
card, micro, No mention that I can see that this will now only work with ROMs installed in a folder on the phone itself, not on a micro SD card.
feature, quick, Excellent! Love the quick resume feature.

features, Key, Rendering perfectly. Key features: Quick save state (works perfectly), portrait and horizontal gaming mode, emulated monitor switch. Overall I wouldn't play it on anything other than vertically because it feels more like a NDS. 5 star for smoothness of emulation, 4 star for UI and 5 star for rendering multiple instances (the reason I had to switch over). One update you could have several save states so S1, S2 and maybe S3. Very happy to pay for this!

screen, Ds, between A and B press or a auto hold option, u cant run and jump through levels in New super Mario bros, multi touch movement problem, were the dpad gets stuck or the Ds touch screen within emulator stops working when moving two touch points and let go of one the other messes up
emulator, awesome, Another awesome emulator definitely recommend this one for nds lovers
screen, split, Basically unplayable when using split screen mode on Android. Resizing doesnt work becuase it wont save changes. It gives the option to resize to 1x or 2x but wont save even when i click both "save as global" and "set as current". After messing with it i can resize it in the editor but again will not save changes, although when i go back to the editor the changes are already there.

EMULATOR, FREE, Can't use START or SELECT in ANY games! I am on a Samsung A51 and I'll be damned if I didn't just convert from the FREE EMULATOR BECAUSE OF THE SAME SITUATION! Really hoping to get an answer from the developers so I don't have to ask Google for a refund!

screen, blank, I start up drastic, tap on load game and it brings me to a blank screen with nothing to tap on, just a folder at the top that does nothing and also shows /storage without letting me choose or find the folder that has all my games on, what the heck am I even supposed to do...
emulator, great, Works almost flawlessly, packed full of features (and also built in cheats) as well as rom hacks. Truly a great emulator and worth the purchase.
tester, beta, I love this app so much Ive decides to become a beta tester to help improve bugs, glitches, and crashes. Some will inevitably crash. Sonic: the dark brotherhood is known for this on Android. Here's to fixing that
app, good, It's a good app absolutely. But it does not work anymore after I changed to Pixel 5. The file browser has broken and is not able to browse any file.
game, new, Everytime I open the app I'm unable to browse my games folder. I open the app, select load new game and in the file browser nothing happens. Please fix it .
emulator, Good, Good emulator but I have a question like if I get mine and a backup from my DSI with Homebrew I like this better than that though cuz this you can use cheat codes easily so then if I use my dsi's nand and then can I play online

emulators, best, DraStic is one of the best emulators I've ever seen and I was blown away when I finally got it working but unfortunately I have to give it one star because on Android 11 I'm unable to set the ROM directory or change games from within the app. The only way to load or change games is to find them in another file manager app and to `open with DraStic`.

emulator, best, Nearly the best DS emulator for Android I've ever used! Button layouts can be personalized by game, there's a pop up menu that allows access to numerous ease of life functions, such as saving/loading, game speed changes, and even control buttons and touchpad disablers, without needing to access the settings panel. Only reason it's not the best is the lack of the multiplayer functionality other emulators offer, really ruins it for pokemon trading/distribution event emulating especially.

emulator, Best, Best DS emulator via mobile. Has a good amount of options, runs smoothly some hiccups but those are rare and with the new updates more bugs are smashed so it gets better. If you want your DS fix I say buy it...it's totally worth every penny!

screen, dual, edit: just dled this emu again since I've gotten myself a Microsoft DS™ (Surface Duo) and the dual screen fits perfectly with the emu's layout. Unfortunately you have to manually adjust everything yourself and there are some instances were some of the options in setting is hidden between the two screens. I own a surface pen for my Duo but I need to buy a Razor Kishi to complete the setup when I play games like metroid prime hunters lol. Worth it!!

review, last, I've upgraded my phone since my last review to an Android 11 with internal storage only. It was not read any files. I followed someone else's advice in reviews: move your roms or thr folder with your roms to the root of your storage, potentially /storage. Once I did that it read the folder and I was able to continue and actually play and game. Besides that my intial review still stands: Don't bother with any other emulators, as Drastic runs 100% even on a low end phone.

folder, drastic, $5 and the app does not recognize roms. Does not matter if they are zipped or not. Online shows to just move them to the drastic folder and you are done. Not the case, these are good roms i transferred them from my pc emulators to my phone.

games, multiple, It runs great, haven't had a problem while playing multiple games already. Rating 3 stars because it doesn't allow me to choose games from my SD card. That's a big deal because my phone doesn't have much storage so I have to rely on my SD card for my ROMs. Edit: So I found an app that helps drastic to read ROMs from SD card. So bumping to 5 star cuz still an awesome emulator. But hope it gets an update so it's able to read from SD card. Edit: Mic don't work on games that requires it..

mapping, botched, A lack of 4x upscaling filters and botched hardware controller button mapping (switching "A" and "B" functions between in-game, overlayed emu menu and full emu menu) and an unnecessary and unremovable "fast forward" button (that is easily and often activated by users by mistake) brings down what was otherwise a competent DS emulator. 1 star until fixed.

storage, external, Why no update yet for external storage?
searches, small, It's pretty reliable and nearly zero effort to use aside from small searches to learn about, say, some settings do. I do notice it is somewhat finicky with resuming a game, sometimes taking a few attempts of tapping Continue or Start Game, as it occasionally crashes a couple times upon start. Once it's going though, zero problems. Mic is a hit or miss for some reason too, so probably avoid like Nintendogs or get a workaround cheat code if possible. Excluding a few tech hiccups, cool beans.

emulator, Best, Best emulator by far. Could you add a feature to be able search the cheat database and assign cheats to a game such as ROM hacks or when cheats aren't automatically detected. Adding them one by one through custom cheats is tedious. Love everything else about this emulator though thanks for creating this amazing piece of nostalgia for us.

multiplayer, primitive, Flawless. I will be extremely happy if some kind of primitive multiplayer support gets released one day :)
update, last, I'm sorry to say that this app just doesn't work. I have a Samsung Note 9, android 10, and I haven't been able to make this app work at all. When it was android 9 it worked, but seeing as the last update was over a year ago, I'm not holding my breath for a new update. Specifically, I click load new game, the screen dims like it's loading something, then the app crashes. Nothing I do fixes this, even a complete reset of my phone.

functions, longer, Used Drastic flawlessly for years. But as of Android 11 it no longer functions. A search online shows that they aren't responding to any help threads either. Do not waste your money on it.
code, cheat, I really used to love this app. That is until the app became frustrating to use. I would insert a cheat code into the custom cheats and the code wouldn't load properly. Another issue is that some of the cheats that were already programmed into the app don't work anymore like they were intended to. If these issues could be resolved I would truly appreciate it.
pokemon, black, Hey guys I love this app but I have stumbled into a problem the arrow at the bottom of my game (pokemon black 2) seems to have gone for good so I can no longer drag up the menu to savestate and I have the manual save bug where it says I cant save over my file blablabla.. I want to play other games on the app but I don't want to close it as It will only give me the option to open my last save can anybody help me please?

ROM, valid, Android 11 Users: This app DOES work, but you need to drop a valid NDS ROM into your MAIN DEVICE FOLDER first, then navigate to the folder where the rest of your ROMs are at. Will rate higher once the storage system is updated properly.

game, single, Waste of money. The app constantly crashes and never saves, the calibration isn't right so the buttons never work and you can't use the touch screen, the custom clock doesn't work and it doesn't read all games. I had to restart on every single game when I transferred phones because the app didn't recognize that the files were there and I couldn't change the folder destination.
sound, Excellent, Excellent, matching sound & quality. No crashes so far, and feels very comfortable to play on.
emulator, Great, Great emulator but one problem: it doesn't accept cheat codes it originally could accept? Is it because of drastic being updated? Please respond ASAP

range, low, BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I have a Samsung A21 which is a kinda mid to low range performance phone, but this is the first emulator I've found where pokemon platinum runs at intended FPS and doesn't crash every 90 seconds, Drastic somehow squeezed the extra performance out lol. Completely worth the money.

menu, quick, Works well, has plenty of options. I mostly play sticker games which are great in the touchscreen, the emulator lets me hide the controllers and nullify the buttons, all from the quick menu which has all the most convenient options at hand. Couldn't ask for more in a DS emulator for mobile phones.

game, new, It was working well at first but when I not only could it not find two of the games I had, but when I tried to start a new game, the app kept crashing. If you're gonna make me spend money on this, you better make damn well sure that it works.
review, first, Made my first review in 2014 and forgot to ever update it. Love this emulator, I get to play all the pokemon games I never got the chance to growing up! Had to change my rating :)
stick, right, I only have a couple of nitpicks: 1- You can't map buttons to directions of the right analog stick on a controller, which its a bummer because there's some games where it'd be handy to map the camera controls buttons (Usually L and R) to pushing the analog left and right. 2- You can only map 1 physical button to each of the emulated controls, which its also a bummer, because even if the first nitpick was fixed, I'd have to swap between mapping L and R to the triggers and analog back and forth.

games, blank, For those of you who are using phones without SD cards, android 11, or those who are getting the blank games list issue please note all you have to do is make a folder within the base directory of your phone. Example is I made a folder called Ds roms in my "internal memory" area. Then booted up the app and bam. My games all work. Phones are different meaning of this doesn't work try moving said folder around until it does. Thank you for a wonderful app. The BEST DS app on the market worth $5.00

stuff, related, I'd give it a 4.5 stars but I'm limited to 4 stars. Everything about this app is perfect, I'm not souch concerned with multiplayer related stuff. One minor concern is adding a gyroscopic controls mostly for driving games. Maybe it could be enabled in the Controls settings and toggled in game. It might not matter to me because I play mostly turn based games but others might appreciate it.

reviews, other, Works really well, I only play Pokémon on it so I don't really have any of the button issues I've seen in other reviews. But it runs smooth and has lots of settings so you can customize it to your preference. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there's no trading or multi-player ability like the My Boy or My Oldboy emulators. Kind of makes certain games a little less fun. So if you guys figure that out then I'll be happy to give you 5 stars. Aside from that, great emulator!

games, favourite, 100% worth the $5. I was hesitant at first to buy it, just because I wasn't sure if it worked well, but I thought 'why not, it's just $5, and if it works great then I'm happy'...so I got it. Works amazingly, I can play my two favourite games on it! I'm sad there's no multiplayer but if it gets added in the future then I can't wait :)
emulator, Amazing, Amazing emulator, runs games better than my desktop emulators
chromebook, new, it cant even play anything because it doesn't want to open it im on a brand new chromebook
gamepad, external, can you make it so it easily adjust the external gamepad
menu, unique, EXTREMELY counter-intuitive. To arrange the screen layout you have to load a game, then open a unique menu, then arrange everything. If you want to switch between gamepad and on-screen controls, (since, you know, I'm not carrying a God damn controller everywhere I go) you'll have to redo your whole layout each time you switch from one to the other. Emulators for other consoles don't have problems like these why are NDS emulators so frustrating?!

drawback, only, This app is the best for DS roms. The only drawback is lack of multiplayer/wifi functionality. However, there is a multiplayer/wifi button in settings so I'm hoping the developer is working on it. Worth the $

emulator, great, Very great emulator so far I have tried Pokémon and Fifa games and they have run smoothly.
emulator, accurate, Most accurate emulator that exists (hopefully it comes to PC someday), but recently I've noticed an issue. I moved my games to another folder, so within the emulator I have to change directories, yet there is no option within the settings to save directories. Every time I open the app I now have to dig past various folders to get to the 1 with the games and it gets annoying.

app, Great, Great app. My only current complaint is that 400% speed up is the highest option besides unlimited. Playing on an S21 ultra its a bit of a pain because 400% is a little slow but unlimited is way too fast. Would love a middle ground. Besides that it's perfection.

emulator, free, I've owned this emulator since 2015, just buy it. No free emulator on android is gonna be good enough. Features include background and button customization, built in cheats with the ability to add your own, controller support, shaders, etc.
day, whole, Everything works properly but it lost my saves for pokemon platinum and i was pretty far. It'd probably take a whole day to gain back that progress if i was commited to doing it.

played, recent, Like the emulator cheap. But now it doesn't recognize my files s20 ultra or scan can't find them. I have to use the dig app to get it to open up and will then display them in recent played! So that helps for a way around it

devices, different, It was a dream until one day when it no longer recognize my storage. It is unable to laugh any games now. Tried on 3 different devices and the problem is unavoidable.
collection, large, This emulator is awesome! If you have a large NDS collection this is the emulator you need to have so that you can take your games on your phone. You can adjust the graphics to look better the NDS. This is a must own emulator. Worth the price.

opening, initial, After the initial opening of the app, it won't even allow me to select a file path for my roms. The file explorer portion of the app simply does nothing once I tap it and I haven't been able to find a workaround. Was a great app before all this.

files, save, Almost perfect, wish I could play multiplayer Mario Kart. Not sure how that could be made to work. Other than that, fantastic. I've had basically no issues, except with some savestates being lost due to some nuances I didn't know about with pokemon games. They're finicky with all their save files. Best not to ever save in-game unless you are required to for some reason. If you do you cannot go back, unless you basically delete everything. Even savestates saved on google drive seem to disappear.
fan, huge, DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW. WAS a huge fan but now it crashes every time I click 'Load New Game' and there's no apparent fix online. Tried clearing memory, deleting files, reinstalling, everything.

work, Great, It no longer works on my OnePlus Nord N10 5G, I cannot select any roms because the storage is broken for the emulator. Nothing shows up in the file browser. Edit: fixed it, love the app. Great work.
problem, common, Was working great before but now it doesn't scan my phone anymore to find any games. It's stuck on the storage with no option to move between folders. I have no idea what's happened to this app as it was amazing but it seems to be a common problem by reading other people's comments. Stay away from this app until this bug is fixed by the developers!

work, great, Awesome.. keep up the great work
alternatives, free, Was sceptical about actually buying this, as there are free alternatives. Still gave this a try after not being satisfied with the others and, it's VERY well worth the purchase. Where other emulators are ad-riddled and perform poorly, this emulator just works right out of the box and delivers a smooth experience, probably even on a lot of devices with lesser performance. UI is clean and understandable, settings aren't overwhelming but still let you do a lot. Thanks for this!

app, suspicious, I loved this emulator 3 years ago. Now it's bad. For starters, I cant access my roms easily and when I finally can access them after hours of searching it wants me to download a suspicious app that I've never heard of and suspect to be malware. Exophase, please, I beg of you. Make roms easier to access. Please Edit (8/8/21): about a year later, they have apparently seen my review and acted upon it. 5 stars.
phone, previous, The app use to work fine on my previous phone but now on my new phone Asus ROG Phone 5 the app is unable to scan any of my games that I own.

games, fun, Great I got to play fun ds games that I would never be able to other wise
game, new, The emulation per se works nigh flawlessly, but the "load new game" option has started to cause some problems by failing to autodetect the folder and locking me out of navigating through folders.It gets stuck on "/storage", where there's only a ".." item that does nothing. Highly annoying issue. It should just let me pick a fixed folder (and start the explorer at /storage/0/emulated) instead of trying to autodetect everytime.

screen, whole, If the game is being played vertical, it doesn't display on the whole screen, the bottom part either has the touch buttons taking up that portion or it's just empty black space. Would be nice if the game can use up the entire screen like a actual Ds. Most ppl use a Bluetooth controller anyway, so having that option would be nice. I reached out to the developer so we'll see. Love this emulator by the way, it actually runs perfectly.

game, new, I love this app, but, I uninstalled it and downloaded it again just now but now, it won't let me go through my phone to find games. When I click "load new game", it scans for new games then just goes to "/storage" and I can't do anything else. I can't look through my phone to find the game within the app

experience, best, The best experience I've ever had
games, other, I've been using this emulator for years, and it's one of only two emulators I've ever happily paid money for. It's pretty flawless, and works brilliantly for mainly touch screen games like Professor Layton, Ghost Trick and Phoenix Wright etc. You can also connect a BT controller for other games, and everything I've tried on it works great. Awesome app.
emulator, great, Pretty great emulator, no ads (as expected), runs smoothly, and so far no issues besides the usage of mic. If you don't have to use a microphone for what you want to play, then you're good to go. This emulator offers great customization/mapping for both portrait and landscape modes. It doesn't include any multiplayer options, however that should be expected for an emulator. It even offers its own cheats for some roms which can be fun to play with. This is by far the best DS emulator for Android.

phone, good, Emulator itself is good until it stops working because you have a good phone. After not using it for a while on my s20 FE, I wanted to come back to it only to find that the in app file explorer is not showing anything and I can't open my rom through another file explorer as this app doesn't show up on the list of supported apps for some reason. On top of all this, the website where I'm supposed to report any bugs doesn't work for another unknown reason. If you have a Samsung phone do not buy.

emulator, great, It's a great DS emulator! Unless you are playing a game that requires the microphone, the emulator is having problems registering anything that involves the use of said microphone, Legend of Zelda: phantom hourglass has THAT one problem that does require using the mic on Eddie to try and get the salvage arm as cheap as possible which makes it impossible since it requires the microphone function. Other than that, if you plan on playing games, play the ones that DO NOT USE THE MICROPHONE FUNCTION!

emulator, good, Very good emulator, worth 5 dollars. No ads, good frame rate. Controls are a little annoying sometimes but it's the best you can do for mobile I guess, so I connected it to my PS4 controller and works fine, the only problem with that is that the ABX and Y buttons don't have a bind for my controller meaning I can't use those buttons. I would really appreciate if this was fixed in the future.

emulator, Fantastic, Fantastic emulator, and the only good one on Playstore that doesn't crash often. Had no crashes, the video quality is great, performance excellent, and each game I got for it has worked without issue.
SD, internal, After updating to Android 11, I can't load Rom even I'm only using my internal SD, the fullscreen option (the option that ignore the notch) seems to be broken with the app
emulator, good, Really good emulator. Everything is smooth and runs good. I use the Myboy series but they don't have a DS so this is good. One problem. The multiplayer/wifi system needs to be added. As a pokemon player, it would be great to trade between game files. As an advance wars player, it would be great to fight against my friends. Certainly could use that. I quite literally say this would be perfect with the connectivity, there is nothing else I could say for improvement.
emulator, functional, Overall, the quality and experience deserves 5 stars. It's a perfectly functional DS emulator for Android, without ads or any major UX issues. However, recently there's been a problem where the app will freeze if it's in the background for any reason, which means you'll lose progress whenever you accidentally open another app or go to your Overview or Home screen. It also means you have to save the game every time you back out to check a wiki.

app, wonderful, It's a wonderful app. It is the perfect application that allows you to play old games that you can no longer purchase or find in person because they're out of date or other reasons. Maybe it's just me but sometimes it glitches and crashes so when I press game A instead of playing game A game b turns on instead. A bit of technical issues but could be my phone or the file. Sometimes crashes as well and shows game glitches when too much of speed forwarding is used. Other than that a it's perfect.

emulator, amazing, Not even going to lie this is an amazing emulator. It speeds, has cheats, and the roms are very easy to process in this. This would be a 5 star app if it wasn't for one thing. Sometimes, after I save the game and leave, and when I try to load it again, it will crash a few times. It's just a minor annoyance, not anything big.

emulator, good, Very good emulator. Only real complaint here is the useless microphone noise button which basically prohibits any use of microphone usage in the roms. Otherwise still a very solid app.

emulator, great, This was once a great emulator. Now it is just stuck on the root directory and not showing folders.
copies, legal, 5 out of 5 stars I added legal back up copies of all of my d's games
team, good, Worthed every penny I spent, good job team
emulator, best, The best (and only) DS emulator that can actually run the games well without lag or anything like that plus LOTS of great features others on the playstore lack, without a doubt THE GO TO for DS Emulation on Android and even in general
storage, internal, Almost perfect! At this time, on Android 11, I cant select the SD card though, and if you go up enough in the path, the path can get stuck with no coming back, cause you can only go up but it doesn't have anywhere to go, and from that point you can't select internal or external storage. Please fix this bug.
emulators, best, This is definitely worth the money. One of the best DS emulators if not the best one out there. Totally recommend it.
emulator, Best, Best DS emulator, hands down. Great work.

version, previous, Drastic won't detect my sd card where i put all my DS games. This didn't happen with the previous version of drastic and its really annoying to keep DS games on my internal storage since it only has a small storage.

emulator, ds, Any ds emulator works even rom hacks
one, right, Very fast, streamline and user friendly. Don't look elsewhere for NDS emulators on Android. You have found the right one.
audio, internal, This emulator runs like a dream. Can it also support internal audio for android 10+ soon too?
emulator, good, A very good emulator, and worth the price..maybe the best on Playstore! The only complain i have is about the backups on Google drive not work all the time, and so bad WiFi don't work as WiFi and multiplayer. Otg cable gamepad work good, and all games with high graphics..Keep up the good work Ps. Not working with Android 11, until they update this, I don't change my 🌟

theme, dark, Can you make dark theme ui. The emulator is great btw
competitor, better, paid garbage-tier software. If a better competitor comes out, I'm dumping this heap of junk.
price, Terrible, Can't even browse game files. Terrible UI. Terrible price, scam
moves, certain, Keeps crashing on FFA2 when certain moves are used. Otherwise works fine. Will update when fixed.

system, horrible, The horrible savestate system will absolutely ruin any enjoyment you will gain from playing the games. It is in desperate need of an overhaul. It works great otherwise.

problem, common, Can't use DraStic's file explorer to open games. Unusable now. Worked fine before but this seems to be a common problem.
titles, classic, Great for playing classic DS titles.

games, most, The emulator itself works great and runs most games flawlessly. There is built-in cheat support and the app comes with it's own cheat database. The only issue is with Android 11 users, the app cannot access any files on the Sd Card due to Android 11's Scoped Storage system. Hopefully a update to this app addresses this. In the meantime I have to copy over my DS games from my SD card to Internal Storage.

way, good, Really good way to enjoy DS games on your phone. Especially if you have an HDMI adapter to play on tv with PS4 trackpad.
emulator, fantastic, Freaking fantastic emulator. I was considering buying a Nintendo DS to relive my childhood games, but instead I bought this app plus a mobile controller. I'm so happy that I can pop up my makeshift Nintendo DS on my phone anywhere. I highly recommend this emulator, you won't regret it. :)

game, automatic, Phone: Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 8/128, Snapdragon 732G. DraStic automatic game scanning doesn't work. Searching manually also doesn't work, permission for files and data are already allowed, but the search manually on internal storage doesn't work. Trying to open manually on File Manager app also doesn't work, it doesn't have DraStic as a choice to open the app. Please do fix this. What's the purpose of me paying this app if I can't use it?

emulator, favourite, My favourite DS emulator. The ability to flip screens (toggle) on controller L3 or R3 is so cool. I wish there was support for multiplayer, the options are there but nothing works. I'd give a 100 star review if you manage to get it up and running. 😉
phones, newer, -edited review- it works fine but in newer phones you have to put your games in the internal memory and its kinda tricky. 3 stars for the lack of support. . --old review-- i never bought an application before but after trying the best "free emulators" and reading a few forum reviews i decided to give this a try... i was not disappointed at all.

experience, great, Emulator works great gaming experience is great however after purchasing the emulator I joined my wife's Google Play family library and I am unable to share this game even though I've already purchased it. I would like to share this emulator with my children on their tablets however I am unable to. Any information in regards to this would be great.
storage, internal, Tried it but it's unable to find files on internal storage rendering it useless because I can't load any games. This is apparently a know issue since March 2020 but hasn't been fixed.

experience, best, With a Bluetooth controller added, this is the best DS emulation experience I've had, by far, even taking PC solutions into account. Only inconvenience I can think of was one out of 4 ROMHacks I downloaded keeps crashing, I personally find it really minor, and the rest of the package more than makes up for it, but it's something to keep in mind if it's important to you.
%, better, I would 100% rate this app 5* cause its 100%, if not 1,000%, times better than SupwrNDS emulator, but I have heard from several folks that at some points ones own save files will suddenly DISAPPEAR!!! It is very odd, love this app tho cause it hasn't happened to me yet, don't doubt it that it will happen tho tbh.

emulator, different, When loading a save file, something happened and it messed up every thing and pretty much I couldn't play a rom that I was playing and it ended up playing another rom and couldn't get it to play the one that I want. Even when I deleted everything and reinstall the game and that game only, it still played that game that didn't choose. Untill I figured out what is going on. I would look for a different emulator and if you use this one be careful when loading up a save file.
library, huge, It runs great. But with a huge library of ROMs and my phone not having enough storage I keep all my ROMs in my SD card, and Drastic is not able to read from SD card. Edit: found and app that helps drastic play games from SD card. But hope it gets update so drastic itself can play from SD card.

screen, big, Love the emulator, but I wish I could shrink the controls size. My hands hurt way too much from trying to stretch on a big screen.
comment, Original, EDIT: Original comment is still true, but a work around I tried is to put your games inside the Drastic folder(which should be at root) in a new folder called NDS. Before you could choose the directory (on my old device at least). ORIGINAL: Cant select games from storage!!! Entire app is useless!!!

emulator, BEST, THE BEST DS emulator out there and worth every cent. Can you guys make a 3DS Emulator as well? I am willing to by that in a heartbeat. So totally worth it!!! Edited: Guys can you add a Browsing Menu for searching up games? Seems like it gets stuck on finding the game menu part, if ever you dont have it on the same folder where the drastic is found.

games, old, This emulator is pretty good but if it supported some kind of netplay it would actually be up to date. I play a bunch of old games and the online part of it is the best. Please enable your features. They can be useful

roms, ds, Needs to be updated so that it can load ds roms from the sd card, on Android 11 and above. Apart from that it works perfectly.
alternative, amazing, Works perfectly wanted to play pokemon black 2 without paying like 200$ on ebay this was an amazing alternative to bad ya can't traid tho but hey still fun to play it again after so long
device, other, I purchased the emulator on my samsung phone but it wont work on my other device. You have to repurchase, with THE SAME GOOGLE PLAY ACCOUNT! which is complete bs!
nds, best, The best nds emulator for mobile
emulator, good, It's a really good emulator, but save your progress often bc it can just crash randomly with no prior warning.
warning, prior, It's a really good emulator, but save your progress often bc it can just crash randomly with no prior warning.
looks, terrible, I downloaded this bc I thought the interface would look v good on a Samsung Z Flip. Nope, its looks terrible. To the point that it looks too irritating to play. Refunded.
versions, Beta, Ok.... Beta nor normal versions allow me to use my SD Card for game playing use on Android, until this is fixed, 1 star.

memory, internal, So this app is apparently broken now. It won't read the internal memory or the SD card. I'm on a note 20 ultra. Even when I use a file explorer and select "open with" DraStic isn't even list as an option. Also it runs itself in the background after you close it for no reason. Now I have no refund option. Never even got to load one game. Bye $5.
folder, black, It doesn't work. It literally shows a black folder and nothing else. You can tap on it and it glows blue but nothing else happens.
cheats, preloaded, Love the preloaded cheats
emulator, brilliant, Was a brilliant emulator but can't access my roms anymore
emulator, Excellent, Excellent emulator.
effect, strange, Seems to be running sped up in 4th gen pokemon games & has some strange visual effect show up some times, using a Oneplus 7 Pro.

A02s, new, Pretty good. Although sometimes it crashes when I boot up a game on my new Galaxy A02s. It can only be circumvented by launching a game through a homescreen shortcut.

customization, full, This product does infact work with the Android 11 Operating system, I have an Android s10e. As far as controls and control displays go, there is an option for full customization on a global and game based level so keep that in mind. I came over from retro arch and although retro arch is good the ds touchpad is a bit awkward to use. This is a step in the right direction. NOTE: I have only used both programs for pokemon games.

games, 3ds, If only it ran 3ds games :(
data, losing, So, I would rate this a 5/5 if not for the fact that it doesn't hold saves. It used to in the past, but now, forever reason, it won't hold in-game saves which it highly recommend you do to prevent losing data.
bindings, key, Runs games smoothly. Allows you to adjust screens and screen sizes and key bindings. Supports external controllers. Excellent emulator.

devices, other, I've tried to run Pokemon platinum on other devices with this emulator and it would run so slow and now it's running smoothly on my current tablet so far. Acer Iconia tablet. Cost me around $150. This app is totally worth the money if one has a device that can handle the games. :)

emulator, best, This is by far the best mobile DS emulator I've tried, even better than some on the PC. My phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and it runs incredibly smoothly. I've never noticed a problem with lag or crunchy music, which is a big plus because I like to play with earbuds. I was hesitant at first to spend money on an emulator, but it was absolutely worth it. I just wish that there was a way to do multiplayer.

chip, best, This emulator has literally never let me down. I use an LG Phoenix 4 phone, so not the best chip or graphics or anything, yet every single game has run without a hitch. Not to mention all the user options! You can choose different filters and so much stuff! This is the best DS emulator on the market, definitely worth every penny.

My tablets is only a year old and is pretty close to best of the best and it suffers this problem. If they can fix these flaws, this app would be perfect and should demand a higher price

s8, old, It doesn't show all of my folders or the games I download. It's an app I used to use to play Pokémon games on when I had my old Galaxy s8 plus phone. Idk if it's a software bug or what, but please fix whatever is causing the app to not show the folders.

games, old, I love this app. It emulates just about anything I need it to fairly perfectly (granted it's mostly pokemon but still). If you are someone that was getting a hankering to replay some of those old ds games you wanted to play, give it a shot here. Just make sure you don't go to any sketchy rom sites, that's how you get a virus (yes even on your phone).

problem, main, The main problem is that the microphone is really hard to use. However, only a select few games use it, and if you do need it there is a way to add a button just for that purpose. I highly recommend this product expesuly if you want to play the da zelda games.

effects, various, Would love a fix for Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift. It keeps crashing with various spell effects. I've gotten 130 hours played on it (with fast-forward feature) and I've found ways to use save states to change the AI and avoid certain spells, or to add a 9-frame manual skip which sometimes skips enough of the spell to not crash. But now I'm fighting a pivotal boss fight and can't get around it crashing.

But now I'm fighting a pivotal boss fight and can't get around it crashing.

ROMs, downloaded, $5 for an app that won't allow me to do anything. App won't show any downloaded ROMs and clicking on the folder to manually search does absolutely nothing.
forwarding, fast, This app is too old. If you want to fast forward at all, do NOT buy this app. When fast forwarding, you have the option to fast forward at 200%, 300%, 400%, or unlimited. On 400% or unlimited, I have absolutely 0 frame drops, but at 200%, I can only play at literally 6fps. Turns out the app forces you to frame skip at 200% and 300% to make old phones work, instead of just giving you the option. All that to say, despite having a premium flagship phone, I can't fast forward unless I play at 10x.

purchase, Best, Best purchase ever!!!
software, open, i have heard rumors that this app may become open source software. will it affect the cost as well? i bought the app, and it will seems to be a waste if the rumors were true
directory, good, Excellently made! This emulator is highly customizable from the UI to screen placement to control layout! It has a good directory, and it is low on your battery draw! No crashes like the usual open source emus for andriod. Approved cheats included, and you are able to add your own! Fantastic job!

emulator, great, This DS emulator is spot. I bought it out of curiosity and I saw my brother playing DS on his phone I'm like how. He told me about this emulator to be honest I'm just playing Pokemon. It's a great emulator
emulator, solid, Nostalgia, in all it's glorious and then some, thanks to a solid emulator with all the features you could ask for.
game, new, Was very disappointed after paying for it only to find that it wouldn't even let me play any roms. When I click load new game none of the roms I have in my storage appear in drastic. All I see is all games and recent games at the top, and a folder icon that I can't click on underneath. I've tried everything I can to fix this and I finally found a way to play roms with this emulator. You have to download a file explorer app called ZArchiver and run the roms through that. For a paid app, not good.

time, 2nd, Closes on me when I try to start a game, but always work the 2nd time I load it. I get a message about it closing randomly which happened few times but found a DiY fix somewhere on the web. All in all, its an okay app. But it DEFINITELY doesn't compare to Fast Emulator (A.K.A. MyBoy, a gba emulator,) and I 100% DEFINITELY dont reccomend paying for it. But its what I paid, just not at the quality I expected. Not bad, just needs a decent amount more work.

interface, clean, I am very pleased with this app. It is user friendly, it has a very clean interface, and it also runs quite smoothly. The 5 dollars is a good price for a reliable emulator.

times, many, I have pirated this so many times, but I felt generous so I finally bought it. Locking an emulator behind a paywall is sketchy, but eh, ds emulation is hard and this one is the cream of the crop. So many quality of life stuff normal android ds emulators just do not have. 5 euros is not *that* much, and its very much worth it. This emulator, pirated or not made the past 5 ys of my life what they were.

card, external, For the developer: please make possible to use external SD card so I don't have to load all games on the internal storage. After installing and trying all the other emulators on the Play Store and trying the demo version of DraStic I decided to buy it. It's absolutely the best and fastest DS emulator for Android. Would be nice if WI-Fi support was enabled and also a better management of save states, beside this it is perfect.

game, new, Can't load games. When I click "load new game" the app only show "emulated" and "self". When I clicked "emulated" it showed empty list instead of folders like in file explorer so I can't go to the folder where I placed my games and I can't find "self" in file explorer therefore the app is useless. Tested on OnePlus Nord N10 5G. It used to work great on my old phone. Hope the dev can fix it soon.

equivilant, free, Fps is way better than the free equivilant of this. And the controls are usable and immersive. Great job tbh

emulator, great, Can't find roms saved in the sd card. I tried looking a work around in the forums, but there's no way to fix my problem. Besides that, great emulator.
games, 3ds, This app is good,and I enjoy playing Sonic Colors (DS) on it,but I have a question:do 3ds games work on it? Im tired of playing just DS games on it.Other than that question,solid app.

emulator, great, Works well, great emulator, just wish there was a way we could move the buttons where we want, they more often then not cover the screen making touch screen games harder or near impossible to play or when a game has buttons and touch screen it's annoying when switches between the two. Also, if the button to reset the game was quicker to get to/able to be put on the screen. I for one like shiny hunting and having it there/having a more customizable overlay would make things alot more enjoyable.

button, 3rd, The 3rd special button is not appearing despite clearing data, reinstalling the emu again... It does appear in layout editor, but nowhere else can I find it in game, despite me trying to change the settings one by one to test out what cause this

states, save, Crashes after 5mins. Also my save states don't work. The emulator fails to even meet standards of gba emulator. Everything is so clunky within the menu.
apps, few, One of the few apps I bought and it's cool :) Able to play pokemon 4th gen games.
storage, internal, Doesn't work on Android 11, doesn't appear to have access to internal storage despite giving it permission.
deal, great, Its a great deal
emulator, Incredible, Incredible emulator
screen, new, Load new game screen simply doesn't work whatsoever.
job, great, it does a great job
progress, recent, Was working absolutely fine until just recently. Screen randomly turns black and freezes the game. Only way around is to reload the game which loses my recent progress. Edit: I have recently started using the auto save feature and now it no longer freezes. Been absolutely brilliant. 5 stars.
feature, useless, Android 11's new "Scoped Storage" is the reason why this app cannot access SD Card anymore, they add this useless feature for "pRiVAcY fRiEnDLy", they really ruined all emulator apps because of this feature.

experience, Great, Great experience, though needs a GBA slot for Harvest Moon DS Cute! :)
reason, only, Runs games perfect, the only reason it's not a 5 star is because the fast forward seems extremely laggy no matter what game or settings, when set to unlimited its perfect for fps but way to fast at 1000+ percent, but if I have it set to any of the set speeds like 200, it feel choppy and not smooth at all
emulator, Best, Best ds emulator ever run smoothly in my phone no lag,crush,or any delay in game play
mejor, corría, Problemas de la precisión de los controles en Redmi Note 7, antes tenía un Samsung J5 y me corría mejor.
months, few, Worked fine for a while but after an update a few months ago it's constantly freezing
games, certain, It's great. The gameplay is nearly flawless. Kids love it on their tablets. Even better if your phone has a built in stylus for certain games. Only problem is no Wi-Fi multiplayer support. If you can update with that or even a Bluetooth connection I'd give it a 5.

emulator, good, I was worried at first I bought an emulator before and it didn't work so I wasn't going to get it but so happy I did its a really good emulator
update, Recent, Recent update to android 11 prevents access to the sd card completely on this app. Last update for this app was apr of 2020, it feels like this app has been abandoned. Android 11 has been out for a while now, yet no fix in sight.

one, free, I paid $5 for this and it's basically the free one but crashes more. If you can refund me that'd be great.
jump, good, Has a lot of potential. Multiplayer compatibility would be a good jump and Gameboy compatible would be nice too.
emulator, best, This is the best DS emulator in existence. The only thing that could make it better would be incorporating achievement support through retroachievments.

user, Customisable, At first I thought "no way I'm paying for an emulator! I'd just buy a DS!" But oh BOY am I glad I took the chance. Customisable user interface down to each button and screen placent, not to mention the best emulator I've used, possibly for any console. Other emulators are choppy, mess all the textures up and make the music sound like it was made by someone with no sense of rythym, but this emulator is as good as the original as were ever going to get. Just buy it, trust me

folder, appropriate, The emulator worked flawlessly on my S9 plus but now that I've downloaded it onto my S20 the app can't find the folder with my ROMs and I'm unable to navigate to the appropriate folder
experience, nice, Very nice experience and options but not the most modern looking and has some settings that refuse to update sometimes.

tool, Wonderful, Wonderful tool, no complaints. However, wanted to give mention to a current issue I am experiencing today. Opening and 'continuing' crashes the app every time, unsure why. Worried that uninstall/reinstall will mess up save data. Galaxy S21 Ultra. Hopefully addressed soon. Thanks!

games, old, Works well. Sometimes freezes tho? But that's RARE. very good for playing old pokemon games 👍
times, several, Was having fun over all playing Pokemon white 2, but then once I made it to mistralton city and to board the plane, the screen goes black, yet the music continues to play, so I can't make it to lentimas town, unable to progress in the game. I've tried several times, along with disabling any cheats I have on, thinking maybe it was part of the problem, but nothing worked, so I'm stuck in mistralton city, unable to continue.
problems, few, I just had a few problems learning how to work it
emulator, Best, Best ds emulator i have used by far. Has close to no bugs and is smooth even on my old lenovo v7 phone.

issues, related, Works perfectly for me. Zero crashes and no emulator-related issues. I wish some functionality to enter and save personal custom cheat-codes would improve the experience. Device used is a Samsung Galaxy A71, using touch screen controls. Have mainly played Pokémon games.

emulator, Best, Best emulator I've used
purchase, Best, It's been nearly a decade since I bought and installed DraStic and I am still impressed by it's quality. Best purchase I have made, no doubt.
tablet, better, This literally got 60 fps on my KINDLE FIRE (yes you can get Google play on Kindle Fire). That thing only had 1 gb of ram and it still delivered. I now use it on a much better tablet and still get 60 (obviously). Overall, I am very pleased and am very thankful to whoever developed this.
sites, unsafe, Nice. Don't install roms from unsafe sites though. Could end somewhat badly for you.
idk, dissapointed, I just bought it and it keeps crashing im so dissapointed idk what to do
device, other, Please add support for android 11. :) My other device can't access sd card. Thank you. :)
feature, extra, Very nice for the price easily plays the roms and has some built in cheats for that extra debug feature, very nice
feature, debug, Very nice for the price easily plays the roms and has some built in cheats for that extra debug feature, very nice
time, big, Darn near Perfect. No trouble what-so-ever getting set. Has all the features I've come to expect in quality Nds emulation. Only problem is getting it to properly function with an Xbox one controller. Wish there was a button mapping process, big time. Would be 5 stars.
years, few, But they stopped a few years ago but you can tell that it's not really great anymore I wish I can get a refund
Emulator, best, The best NDS Emulator on Play Store, no crashes so far, money well spent on this app
end, low, drastic can even run on low end phones. devs really deserve my money.
emulator, Best, Best emulator although no multiplayer but that fine
emulator, Finest, Finest emulator for android to those who had not have Nintendo DS physically.
app, used, Use to be my most used app on my phone until the most recent update. Now I can't access my roms on my SD card. Looks like this is something that's been known for months but the devs aren't doing anything to fix the issue. Such a shame :\

u, Best, Best ds emulator u can get on Android

update, recent, * I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S20FE I don't know if it's because of a recent update or what but when trying to load a game the file explorer shows up blank. the only way I was able to play one was by downloading an external file Explorer app and going to my ROM folder to load the game. (The default Samsung file explorer won't work because you can't manually pick an app to open an associated file type. It tries to do it automatically otherwise it tells you to download from Play store)

storage, scoped, App doesn't support android 11 storage (pixel 3a), just stuck in empty /storage folder, no scoped storage in use.
emulator, definitive, The definitive DS emulator for Android. However more updates and optimizations, and options would be nice, along the ability to use your own DS BIOS like melonDS. As a side note, the bluetooth audio streaming for hearing aids (using the Oticon Streamer Pro) is so painfully delayed and low quality. Youtube and Instagram doesn't have this problem.

problem, major, Played for around 25+ hours so far. Everything works fine. The app never crash. Not once I ever ran into any major problem. The touchscreen works really well, never expected that from an emulator. 5 bucks for an app that work well like this is amazing.
update, new, Cant load games from storage since new update. Galaxy s10
code, cheat, I would have still paid for this even if it was 5 times the price. That alone you can tell how satisfied I am. But something happened that I just noticed recently, I am unable to press 3 buttons at a time. I was trying to activate a cheat code but I can only press 2 buttons at the same time. Am I missing something?

performance, Good, One of the maybe four apps I liked enough to buy. So stable, never had an issue. Save state updated whenever it goes to the background which is a must for phone multitasking. Good performance even on an old motorola phone. Able to customize controller layouts PER GAME. It just works.
