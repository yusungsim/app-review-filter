ran, into, issue, Great game. My only issue is that you can't move a ride a pixel length over because technically, the ride you're trying to move is there. It will cost some money, but I have never ran into an issue where money was ever a problem. This game can ALMOST be played as a sandbox, if you manage your expenses. My third run though the game, I am at the decorating stage... up from discovery and placement. Having a blast!

buy, on, steam, One of the absolute best offline games for Android and the best Kairosoft game by far. Absolutely worth the money - no ads, no microtransactions. The game is cute, funny, and has tons of stuff to keep you replaying. The game is challenging but not impossible, you just need to really think your choices through. The game design and balance is pretty good too. I easily have played over 60 hours of this game, which is better than most premium games you'd buy on steam.
Reminds, of, games, Reminds me of the old games. And its free to expand the park? I love it.
add, to, experience, Missing many small QoL tweaks that add up to a frustrating experience. 1) You can't rotate building plots in a land management game, and the entrance to the ride can't be changed unless you move the building. 2) You can't move a building if it overlaps the footprint of the to be moved building (so changing the gate entrance or moving it 1 sqaure to widen the footpath). Meaning you need to pay to move a building twice. Once to a remote corner of your park than again to where you wanted. 3) Thier is no time control for pause or fast forward so with the garbage building placement system if you need to make layout changes you will get into a negative balance for that season.

played, from, developer, Another solid Kairosoft management sim. This is a little bit like Theme Park, but with an interface players will recognise if they have played other titles from this developer. It's a little slow to make progress it it's a very pleasant game to kill time.
looking, to, guys, one of the best android games. simple but very fun üëçüëç. I'm really looking forward to you guys making police, wrestling/mma and vigilante simulation games
swinging, from, tree, Game is entertaining while you are swinging from tree to tree. Gorilla approve!

restart, due, decision, Very addictive, even though it can be a bit overwhelming at times with so much stuff to put down and not much space. I had to restart once due to a wrong early decision, so not that easy. My first Kairosoft game since Game Dev Story and Pocket stables, and still happy with my purchase.
embarked, upon, Third, Another brilliant game by Kairisoft. Third of their series' I've embarked upon, and enjoying as much as the others.
overlaps, to, space, Good but not great. Many quality of life issues make things frustrating. No building rotation. Can't move a building anywhere it overlaps its current footprint, only to purely empty space, which means you can't adjust buildings. Can't expand a building in the direction of its entrance, only NE, NW, SW. Height is confusing. Can't filter facilities by type, so when you get a new item for your balloon stand, you have to scroll through a list which includes every tree. Game is not quite done.

introduced, to, house, At first I didn't like the game but after I was introduced to the haunted house now i really really love this game.
put, on, one, They put their best people on this one and it shows. Charm is oozing out the sides and everything is just great and wonderfully put together. Top notch, Kairosoft.
put, from, formula, This game has me hooked!! I love how yall put a little bit of everything from your beloved formula of games in this one ‚ù§‚ù§ I truly feel it deserves a solid 5 Stars P.S. yall should make a Casino Tycoon game !!!
expect, from, team, Wouldn't expect anything else from such an amazing team üëè great price, replayabikity and posabikities are so much and the challenging casual vibes like most of the games from kirosoft this one is a must if you love games like Rollercoaster tycoon 1 except much cuter and more casual
do, for, years, This is the kairosoft game I've been waiting for! Ice been wanting them to do a theme park for years. I'm enjoying it so far, lots to do. Highly recommended.
closing, on, me, Love the game, but it keeps closing on me and wont let me play. Please fix this issue!
addicted, with, game, So addicted with this game. So much fun.
reflected, in, increase, The price increase is reflected in the content increase of this game.
pops, at, end, Having problems trying to build the facilities. I don't have options other than trees and side walks. I would like to build the popcorn vendor but it only pops up at the end of the year with no option to move it I had to delete it because it wouldn't let me move it from blocking the path. Most of these games have better building mode than this one. The track customization is hard to get how I want it and cost more money moving it around. It would be nice if you could create tracks like paths.

race, on, carts, Kinda feel bad bashing this game 10 min in but its like a small version of Rollercoaster Tycoon. Why can't I build a zip line over the go carts and why can't people race on the go carts... I love kirosoft but not feeling this game so far. Maybe ill change my mind later like the burger game. Edit: refunded it. Hated it that much. Going to play Rollercoaster Tycoon. Sorry kirosoft..
running, into, problem, Amazing game, but I am running into a problem when trying to move attractions. They won't let me place them if the new location overlaps with the old, which makes organizing my park very difficult.

waiting, for, park, Excellent game by Kairosoft once again, I buy every title they release. The price is more than fair, this is a deep, replayable, fully realized experience. I have been waiting for an amusement park ever since they released the water slide water slide, I realized that they had the parts in motion to be able to do so.

Giving, after, playthrough, Giving my 5‚≠ê after first playthrough in the game. As expected, such an awesome game. It's addicting and challenging. If there's one thing to complain, then it must be that we got real hard time to seeing the square next to the wall since it's not really invisible. It's casual yet challenging enough to made you wanna keep going. 10/10 gonna recommend it to the others. (One question tho, you guys gonna made dungeon village 3 right? I'm waiting for it)
