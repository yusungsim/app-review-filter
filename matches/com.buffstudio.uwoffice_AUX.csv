is, money, spent, This, This game touched my heart so much! It was so well done, I haven't felt this emotional over a quick game in ever :')) I really loved the stories, the lessons, and the interactions the characters had. This is money well spent, thank you for making this game 💗
is, time, second, this, Its such a simple yet beautiful game, this is the second time I've played though it and it makes me cry every time. I love the characters and the story and honestly everything about it
's, game, good, It, It's quite a good game. I love the stories 💖
's, buy, safe, it, This game is more story based than horror so it's a safe buy for anyone i guess. And it's a great story indeed! Animation is great, sound wise too. This game is a top contender of my best purchase of the year! One little thing that bothers me is that the game goes on automatically with only adjustable speed, without option to just manual go through.. still a 5 star game!

are, ways, multiple, they, Is hoodie the monk looking guy from 7 Days? I like your games. The choices really feel like they matter, they aren't just multiple ways of choosing the same outcome. I haven't gone for multiple endings in this one yet but I'm really happy with the ending I got. I totally thought Hayden's hat was hair.
was, read, amazing, It, The story is very well written—I love how the main character developed. I wish there are more cases we can read as an extra lol. It was an amazing read 💕 There are a lot of cute illustrations too, some of them are animated.

's, app, free, it, Most definately worth the buy! I gave it a try on it's free app and snagged it's premium on sale. There's no microtransactions when you just buy the game or ads. Just a lovely story filled with a wide cast of wacky characters, all with their own character growth and story you unvail as you read. I also love how my choices feel like they matter.

's, adventure, own, it, Underworld Office is billed as a chat-style interactive storytelling game, so it's basically a choose-your-own-adventure with branching paths. This kind of setup allows for a fair bit of replayability if you'd like to see all of the game's endings, and thanks to a few collectible items, there's more than one reason to replay. It also doesn't hurt that the title offers a heartfelt story, so it should easily keep players coming back for a bit. This game is on sale and it's definitely worth it.
's, one, great, it, Just awesome! I didn't finish the game yet, but I can tell it's a great one.
