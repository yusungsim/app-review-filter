's, story, ended, it, I had high hopes for this game but I have to give a scathing review. This game is boring. Instead of being a game that allows you to care for your Tgotchi and seeing the impact of your long term actions,, it's a short ended, rail-guided, get-the-same-ending-because-you-don't-hace-a-choice story with no way to progress. I don't like how much this game was hyped up when it did not exceed let alone meet any expectations. It's got a good concept but the execution is horrible. I want my money back..
was, screen, black, it, Dear Developer, I NEED help. I have seen people do this game, so I decided to download it to! But when I opened the app, It just played weird music, and it was a black screen. If you see this, please help. Thank You:).
'm, fan, huge, I, I'm a huge fan of virtual pets, an avid Tamagotchi collector, but I was not too thrilled with this app. It tries to be a horror game, where the girl comes down with illness and depression from being neglected by the owner - the player - but it doesn't feel as if the player is neglecting her by choice. The game is full of arbitrary time skips, then claiming the player was neglecting their T-Gotchi, even though they've been doing their best to feed and wash her on every day the game lets you. The player is supposed to feel bad for neglecting the girl, but the player doesn't actually choose to neglect her. The player doesn't forget to feed her, or just get bored and not check for a few weeks, the game *tells* the player they neglected her, rather than actually letting the player do so. I think it would have achieved what it was going for much more if it ran in real time, with the player being expected to check on her at various points throughout the day, Eventually, the player would get tired of the game, and stop checking up on her, but when they do one day genuinely decide to log back into the game, they would see what effects the players neglect is having on the girl. I think that would have been much more impactful. This doesn't strike me as either a good vpet, or a good horror game. Just a game with a somewhat decent concept that was messed up.
are, guy, last, we, I just realized why she says "I hope your better than the last guy" everytime we get a new t gotchi, we are the last guy who killed her and she wants us to be betterðŸ¤¯

was, screen, blank, it, i know this game is good but when i opened the app it was a blank screen but i could still hear the music and click stuff.
's, game, spooky, It, It's honestly a very spooky game and most of the endings made me feel like a creep, don't know how I feel about that. Overall though, it's a well thought out game. I love the concept of having a tamagotchi that is aware of itself and accompanied by some pretty dark tone, really cool. (Could you add an auto screen rotation, I'm not used with the current angle of the landscape mode)

's, game, okay, It, It's an okay game but i don't like that she is always the same person- it etskinda strange that her name changes ;-; it's confusing because her name can either be tsunami or tamie or tomie or something within the contents of the letter "T" and now i understand the name but other wise his game is awesome :D

's, screen, blank, it, I gave it a try and was liking it but after she takes a shower it's just a blank screen without her there. I can still talk and feed her but it stays blank. Also there's no save option so when I exited to try again it still did the same. I remember the old tamagotchi from the early 90s I had so I had to try this out
is, screen, black, it, all it is just a black screen when is click all over the place on the black screnn and i can hear buttens clicking
is, screen, black, it, it looks fun but it dosen't work all it is a black screen thats it
