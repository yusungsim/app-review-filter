game, good, Its a good game but bloonarius is almost unkillable without cash drops and make it easier to get trophies and churchill a little stronger because churchill isnt worth the price but also make bloonarius health 15k at least, i highly recommend this game and it is very fun and mostly balanced, can ther be more stuff though like a non hero sword monkey or the bloon chipper, cobra, btd5 and below stuff thay i miss, (im only missing the 5th to the bloons franchise) otherwise keep up the awsome work NK

games, best, Is the best td games that I've ever played. Usually in the game I would get bored and stop playing them but this game i probably won't stop playing.
game, best, I love this game instal it best game ever if this is Free i will love 1000000 times more
fun, Awesome, Awesome fun!!
bug, only, The game isn't even playable. If you get a add it crashes every time after it plays and if you go back in it forces you to watch it again so you can never play a match. This is far from the only bug that crashes the game so please fix the game I loved the original and I want to like the gam but I can't if it's broken
games, other, SO ADDICTING I can play this game for hours and I play ninja kiwis other games and they're just as addicting as this
game, fun, A fun game but co op mode reconnections ruin the experience. Full wifi signal yet the game still drops out and often doesn't recover and ends the game. Awesome game though
player, Single, Jan 14,2021 Very disappointed in the gameplay within this app. CO-OP still doesnt work properly, tons of connection issues (for no reason), being unable to fast forward past wave 18 since everyone lags and game becomes stuttery. Single player is amazing Update Dec 1,2021 Multiplayer still doesnt work probably with everyone getting disconnected every 2 rounds and getting stuck on waiting till round ends to join back (going ons till you give up and leave)
thing, few, Love it, but there are a few thing I want you to add new towers like the ones on tweitys vids and add more bloons and more stuff in general But this game is a life saver it cures your boredom I will change eating once thos are added

game, op, Play a co-op game for 20 minutes, get to level 79/80 on hard, get disconnected from game, immediately attempt to rejoin, game says your position in the game closed and you just wasted your time. Join a new game, repeat, never make any meaningful progress. Co-op is a joke.

second, split, For some reason, every time I play a match it'll randomly disconnect for just a split second. The problem with this is that it happens multiple times so it'll kick me out for disconnecting too many times. This doesn't happen with any other game and my Internet is fine.

game, Best, Best game on play store by a mile when it comes to an all round tower defense game that keeps you playing even if it's just a short game every now and again it's very addictive. Remember this from school years ago playing btd4 on computer and over the years it's quite astonishing how ninjakiwi have evolved their Bloons games and the Bloons community are great. Thank you ninjakiwi for keeping us all happy with content updates and still in the game for many years to come :)

games, other, I played the other games they were just fine, but when I bought this game it doesn't even start up. I don't belive it is my phone because it can run other games that need internet even better. Also I don't think it's the internet. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone because it won't even start. I've read the other reviews and they talk about how good the game is. I can't even play this game. This Sucks! Would have given it 0 stars if I could. I want my money back . >:(

reason, only, I love this game. I played it at a friends house 3 months ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. All of my friends play it, and its one of the best tower defense games I've played. But the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, I have an Acer Chromebook 15, and it won't install on my device. I don't really get it, and I read all of the common problems, but they all seem to be already fixed. Anyone else have this problem?

time, long, I'm a long time fan of bloons so this review cuts deep especially after spending so many hours and money on bloons 5. This game captures the same charm as BTD5 but feels only skin deep when you compare things like monkey money rate and challenge balances. The earning rate was nerfed into the floor while the spending options increased 2 fold. The challenges have long stopped being fun and have become a souls like grind to find perfection instead of just being fun, different and challenging.

paragon, ninja, You guys should make it so the ninja paragon since it sucks up shinobi tactics also will allow it to attack xtremely fast so it should throw 40 shurikens the shurikens should also have the master bomber explosion that destroys moabs on hit he should also throw those orbiting blasts around him he should use that as a sticky bomb but he can rapid fire it but he can only do that at paragon degree 20 hopefully you add this to BTD6 ANYWAYS I LOVE YOUR GAME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING NICEFrom MicahFilton

mess, complete, Would had given it 5 stars but the online is a complete mess, constantly disconnecting players and sometimes it doesn't even let you re join.
content, new, monke. I've put over 100 hours into this game. Would say best $5 I've spent, but there was a discount, so I got it for $2. Great for hours of fun, and being constantly updated with new content for you to use. Best game on the platform.

limit, ridiculous, playing for years, any im kinda tired of getting kicked from a game, than rejoining to later be removed you should not have the option to kick it should be a time limit kinda ridiculous. and plus if you join and it says wait till the end of a round you just get stuck on that screen, and have no option but to leave.
game, different, So i uninstalled this so i can get a different game not made bye you and i didn't know it would get rid of my accout super popper and i lost all of my progress so please restore my account i was so close to getting a paragon and i was at 70,000 exp on my dart monkey so please restore my account

game, solid, Giving it a 1 star now, can't even play a solid game with my girlfriend, the connection with leaving the game all the time is beyond bad, also nothing is wrong with my internet, so please don't blame it on this. I've literally paid for this game and it doesn't even work properly.

idea, 1st, I love this game I got it months ago but maybe 2 years ago but I was inspired to wanna play it by another person who plays but I have 3 idea's to update this game. My 1st idea is to add sport monkeys such as Basket Monkey, Soccer monkey, Dodge Monkey, Volley Monkey, wrestle monkey, and football monkey, baseball monkey, Hockey Monkey, and Tennis Monkey. My 2nd idea is to add Holiday monkeys and you know all the holidays. 3rd make a Coach hero with the name Coach Marcus who throws all sport balls.

game, Amazing, Amazing game so far! I've watched videos on it of people playing but its not untill ive actually expierienced it myself thatIi realized how great the game actually was. Worth the money spent for sure, if I could give it 6 stars, I would.
price, initial, This game is really fun. It's also good to play with friends. Has surprisingly alot of content and is not pay to win. I love clash of clans but it is pay to win where as this game you can grab a computer or phone and you can make it to the leaderbords if your good enough without having to spend more than the initial price.
games, last, Probably one of the last good games in its genre.

ratings, actual, Weird. My review was removed again. Don't play this game. The devs are completely incapable of taking criticism. They're dishonest in their actual ratings if I've been removed three times now. If the game has issues fix it. I mean seriously what kind of snowflakes deletes a review becau it's complaining about something. I havnt played the game since my first review that's been removed and a few of my buddies are too. They say they're gonna let their friends who play this game know too. Fix. It.

way, fun, Was a bit on the fence buying this game as I don't really like tower defense games, but this game does it really well and in a fun way as well. You should definitely give it a try.

tike, amazing, I have had an amazing tike playing this game its a great time passer I only have one suggestion and it isn't from me directly but I have seen an idea on reddit for adding a farmer icon to banana farms as a buff icon so it's easier to know if they are in range or if anything link bannana farmers to the farms so when you buy one and there's a banana farmer on the screen it triggers a range display and every farmers radius is shown as if It were selected. That's all otherwise this game would be 5.

player, single, It's a great single player game. It can be fun playing co-op but the co-op servers are absolute trash. I have lost count of how many times my best insta monkey disappears into thin air as I place it or how many $1000's have disappeared as well. I've even had monkey money lag out with no reimbursement. It's complete BS

game, good, A good game, but I would like to have the village available when you play the primary only, military only, or the magic only modes. It would be so much more helpful, especially with the camo detection.

Also the prizes amount you earn is very small Two stars for A stressful game 👎👎 no fun playing anymore 😤❌

run, entire, The difficulty spike with the Elite Bloonarius/Elite Lych is ridiculous. Strategy is one thing. Having to basically quit out the game, sell your towers/farms, reset those farms and towers up, and doing that for the entire run is stupid. Should be able to just play the damn game without having to cheese it to win.

weeks, last, Love this game. But, there was one problem I've had with in the last 3 weeks I've been playing. I completed a odyessy and I didn't get the rewards. I'm pretty sure the reward is trophies for the trophy shop. I checked before, and I had 5 trophies, and when I went back to the trophy shop I still had 5 trophies.
time, less, Super slow and crashes alot. I cant play the game properly anymore. After the update, I felt like I was getting the 2010 experience. It took less time for my computer to startup then entering into a map. They really deleted my first two ratings.

gunner, dartling, Game good, no dartling Edit: game good, yes dartling There's a glitch with the dartling gunner in the track race beginner map where if I use the dartling ability, it always faces down.
player, single, The single player campaign it's perfect! With little to no lag except when the bloons or the projectiles are too many for the game to handle. There's so much game mode where you must alternate your defenses 5 star for the single player But.... The multiplayer it's very bad for mobile. It's so laggy, me or my teammate always disconnecting for seemingly no reason. There's also very noticeable amount of delay 2 star for the multiplayer aspect

I've got INSANELY good internet (400mbps) and its like im re-living the days of playing games on 56k.... UPGRADE YOUR SERVERS OR DONT OFFER CO-OP MODE.

experience, enjoyable, I absolutely love the Bloons TD franchise and I enjoy passing the time with this game. I've put plenty of hours into it and tend to have an enjoyable experience. My biggest complaint would be the co-op aspect of it. It seems I'm constantly being kicked and whenever I rejoin it'll just kick me right back out. It has cost me a few Impoppable challenges due to me being unable to support my teammates. I just hope the online will get worked on soon because the game is great otherwise.

game, good, Overall really good game with heaps of great features. Super satisfying to play, the game progresses well with yoyr skill level, there are a lot of features where you need to look past the surface to find.

player, old, I'm an old btd 5 player, this is my experience. I bought this beautiful game pretty late. Around a year ago, I first played it and instantly loved it as soon as I started. I still find ways to get around boredom with it. Love it so much 11/10

characters, many, This is one of the best tower defense games i have ever played on the playstore, there's many different characters, heroes, and there's even special bosses like the lych or bloonarius! I also love how you gotta get xp to unlock different upgrades for different characters. One problem tho, is probably giving Etienne bit of a buff, and maybe making the lasers that the alien skin of etn shoots count as lasers, so it would pop leads, but not able to pop purple bloons. Keep this game in mind!

game, solid, Ive been playing Bloons for over 6 years and I'd like to talk about 6 for a second. It's a solid game. It's got to s of towers and upgrades and tons of maps and packs a lot of content. But the over all game can't compare to the charm and fun of Bloonstd5. Over all though great game and you should get it if your thinking about it.

game, good, This is a very good td (tower defense) game, there are many towers/monkeys and many different strategies so you can pretty much do anything, play there is a sandbox for when you beat a level, and in general there is just a bunch of modes, a few things I want to see added is a vs mode and maybe more monkeys.

Other games you can easily spend over 100 dollars and your STILL scrambling to get anywhere. This game is great!

money, Best, Best money I've spent on a mobile game ever before and with all of the new content NK has been adding, it's be alot more enjoyable with much more to do! I had Bloons TD 6 rated lower because the game was getting stale with the slow updates but NK has improved the game greatly since then.🤟🏼 The multiplayer still needs some work however. It's tough trying to play with friends having connection issues being relatively common. It would make the game that much better then it already is if fixed.

time, third, My third time deleting and trying to install the game I spent 30 MINUTES TRYING TOOG IN TO MY FREAKING ACCOUNT and I can't even do that the game just restarted all my data at this point bc at first When I wanted to play the game it went dark immediately so I deleted it and forgot about the game entirely come back and all the sudden I can't even log in. Wow I love this game.
game, Best, Best game of the year hands down.
questions, numerous, Up until now I've loved BTD6. I had admired their integrity with IAPs and customer satisfaction. I believed everything available in game was obtainable by playing, especially since the game cost money to play to begin with. Unfortunately I've found a game changing $20 IAP that cannot be obtained without payment that DOUBLES cash earned in game. Also, CO-OP is unplayable and after contacting support I was asked numerous questions for days just to be told they're already aware and looking into it
game, good, I give it a 5 because it a good game but why we got to be on level 1 I Wachovia youtuber and there 124 why when we buy the game why we got to make it hard to level up I'm not saying to not change the game I'm just saying why

tower, broken, Near perfection. All I want is the blood chipper back, because broken tower.
game, Best, Best strategy game I have ever played in my life. Only problem is the co-op game mode. Often lags out and glitches and the server is super slow, resulting in high packet loss so my friends and I were even able to get a Tier 5 which we did not have by spam clicking

quality, lower, I love this game BUT BTD6 Really needs some options to help with the lag. Devs need to update this game and add 'remove effects' and 'lower quality' so that the FPS is normal when playing a boss game!! Otherwise would be 5*
game, amazing, This is an amazing game and I would pay for this 10 times to play it for an hour. Very addictive, pretty much the only game I play these days.

towers, new, I like this game although bloonchipper is missing it makes up for it by the new towers which are very good in their own unique way. The only thing that could make me happier is if bloonchipper was put in.
