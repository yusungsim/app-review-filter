dialog, quirky, The idea is neat but the writing is terrible and trying too hard to be quirky. Nobody would talk like this in such a situation. It totally takes you out of the situation. Some humor here and there is fine, some quirky dialog here and there is fine, but if seems like every time Taylor says something it's like something I'd write in middle school. If you want a serious tone go elsewhere. Taylor talks like a Redditor

time, real, I loved the whole actually waiting in real time and the story ‚ò∫Ô∏è
experience, interesting, What an interesting and unique game experience! I love that the game progresses in real time. (The character might go to sleep and message again 6 hours later.) It's keeping me engaged and feeling like I'm really communicating with someone out there.

story, nice, This is a nice little story! It gave me pleasant flashbacks to the old Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books that I loved years ago. (What's more, I've been playing it in German for language-learning purposes. Conversational and new scifi vocabulary! It's great!)

phone, new, Reduced from 5 to 1 I purchased this already. Wanted to install on a new phone and wanted me to purchase AGAIN! BOOOO
moon, alone, The character is totally unrelatable and annoying. While playing, some part of me is happy when he is accidentally die. I dont even get why I would want to help him other than I had paid for the game. Go die on the moon alone with that attitude.
game, own, If you want a modern "Choose your own adventure game", then this is the game for you. I enjoyed every moment! The story was mysterious, suspenseful, and emotional. You find yourself worrying about the main character Taylor, and really wanting to help. An amazing and engaging story! I will continue to follow the Lifeline series and I hope they continue to make more amazing stories

app, favorite, My favorite app of all time. And that's been constant since 2015.
money, fantastic, Absolutely fantastic and well worth the money, I've recommend it to all my friends!
concept, interesting, I've only been playing for a day, but this is such a interesting concept, and Taylor is a really likeable character. I'm fascinated to see where it goes! I read about it on an article by The Live Life, they said it was one of the top 5 mobile games worth playing :) Then onyl criticism I'd say (from my limited experience this far) would be the option to check in on him occasionally? Even if it is limited to the game providing you with the opportunity, rather than being able to do it whenever.

school, high, I played all these games back when I was in high school and loved them! I just heard the company got their rights to the games back and we might get more soon, definitely recommend 10/5
storyline, Original, 89 pence well spent! Original storyline, moody music, snappy dialogue and it makes you pause between gameplay which just heightens your sense of time within the game. Died once as a result of my decisions but managed to get to the end without too many mishaps. Might go back and try different decisions on 'fast' mode. Will probably get the sequel too.

art, great, Pros: great art, the story is actually pretty good at first. The app runs smoothly and you get to make decisions to help another character. Multiple endings. Cons: after a while, the main character you help becomes mean and insults themselves a lot, which made me not want to spend time with them. The choices end up mostly panic or misery, so it's not good for depressed people.

dollar, Best, My Favorite Paced Story Space Game EVER!!! Best dollar I think I've ever spend on entertainment. If you're looking for a game to draw your boredom for every few minutes in the beginning days to hours on the last day like I played you'll be incredibly satisfied with the paths this beautiful game presents. Its easy to work the sound design is simple but spacey, along with the few sighs and blips that force you into the suit with Tayler and closer to her as you fight to save her from so far away.

times, multiple, I really like this game. If you're looking an adventure/story type game this is for you. The fact that you have to wait for Taylor to do wake up, or finish a task really helps with the immersion. I've already played it multiple times and have had it less than a week!
music, relaxing, I'm enjoying it so far. Love the relaxing music
game, Great, Great game and the pacing is perfect. Almost completely accessible to blind players. I played this along with a blind friend and had a great time. Only criticism is at the very end there is text said by other people and the speaker is shown by the text colour, thus not accessible to blind players. I had to explain to my friend that there were now multiple speakers because they were very confused. If you could change it to say the speakers name when it's not Taylor, that would be good.

concept, cool, Definitely worth the dollar I spent on this. A very cool concept, although this particular iteration could have been written better. Very glad I experienced the game. However, this game NEEDS to have a function to automatically scroll to the bottom. I can't count how many times I had to open the app and manually scroll ALL the way to the bottom of the text. Ending had me on edge but was slightly dissatisfying.

gender, non, I love how they made this Taylor non gender specific so i can imagine him/her the way i want. To me Taylor is a he. I played this game for the first time years ago when first Whiteout didnt came out yet. I feel so bad for not having any new Lifeline games to play with. I hope someone will revamp it.

game, interesting, A fertig interesting game
thing, whole, I really didn't enjoy this. I didn't find the protagonist engaging at all and in fact I thought was kinda whiny and irritating.. was expecting the story to branch more and last longer and as a tech comment many of the protagonist's comments were cut off and there was no way for me to expand them to be able to read the whole thing
while, long, Played it again after a long while and was not disappointed. Love the breaks within the game which prevent you from binging this story through in an hour or whatever.

sooo, awsome, This game is awsome sooo interactive and i LOVE IT
telling, good, good story telling
games, driven, The concept of the game is good, I never played story driven games before, but this is an awesome one to begin with. Although the dialogue is lackluster at times you still get captivated by Taylor's faith. Overall a good story, that's worth the money, gonna buy the second game also.

story, great, This is just awesome. Do yourself a favor and play through this great story
game, Best, Best game ever. I bought this back in 2016, July and there was nothing like it on the Play or App Store. Totally worth the buck. The story is captivating, the characters are someone you could fear and care for. Relatable and uncanny. It feels like a great adventure epic James Cameron film. Bravo.

plot, good, Overall, fairly enjoyable. A good branching plot with some fun choices. The protag can be a little whiny at times, but in the end I think that only adds to his whole character and the development of the story. Tip: the earlier you fail at the mission the sooner you can enable fast mode which will let you play the story at will. TBH, I felt that turning on fast mode kind of took the fun out of the delayed message system so steer clear of that if you want the intended experience.

kid, imaginary, I think whichever Lifeline game you end up playing first will be your favorite. They're all good, but this one is dear to my heart as the first that got me emotionally invested in some imaginary kid with only intermittent text interface, lol. You can't really describe why this is so worthwhile to play; just play it. You'll see.

game, Best, Best text adventure game ever made hands down <3 i love u devs you did AMAZING
thriller, little, Best .99 you'll ever spend. It's a taut, crackling little SF thriller, quite enjoyable to read.
story, good, Really good story and gameplay
stuff, Amazing, Amazing stuff. I am so happy that I got to experience it.
story, short, Not what I thought it would be. Not a game, it's a short story.
way, half, Okay half way through the game it kinda doesn't matter what you do taylor will choose own course by not taking your advice but it was still fun at the beginning

effect, significant, it was ok. decent for the price. however the story is too short and after playing through it again, the choices don't have a significant effect on the end. in fact most choices aren't even really choices because the character has a mind of its own. suspense is built by making you wait extended periods of time. so mostly hardly any replayability. i guess the devs didn't want to put much effort in... (please buy for the story and support the devs because the story is actually pretty good)

experience, Amazing, Amazing experience, not a type of a game I'm used to play
plots, enticing, Honestly one of the most enticing and nail biting plots to a game that I've found yet. It had me on the edge of my seat and craving more and more all of the time. Definitely am about to go play the other lifelines next.

choices, clear, Not a cyoab .. Not a game ... The parts that make you wait do not build suspense since you arent given either clear choices at times or illogical/piss poor choices .... This is a simple and linear story that lacks immersion and is weakly entertaining ... I would like a refund ..this is not worth paying for...

Truly a unique and incredible app that feels like a crazy experience! I felt a connection with the person on the other end instantly. Would highly recommend !!

lifeline, new, Why is the new lifeline released but unavailable in the US?
line, interesting, Very interesting story line. Love the way your choices actually affect the plot!
time, real, Even though the concept of a sci-fi story unfolding in real-time is intriguing, the plot absolutely crawls for the first 3 days. Taylor goes back and forth on so many decisions, and questions his/her perceptions constantly (and guess who has to reassure them, constantly!). I gave up before their second attempt at going to the spire. Maybe the story picks up from there, but I've lost interest.

game, based, Thoroughly enjoyed this text-based game. I read that there were many ways to die, yet only died once, so I suppose I got lucky. Plan to purchase the next installment.

person, real, You really start to feel as if you are texting a real person. The only complaint I have is that it's a fairly short game, I beat it in 3 days. Other than that it's perfect. üíØ percent worth the 2 dollars.

story, Great, Great game great story gets wierd at time but still very cool if you like sci fi, takes about 3-4 days to finish if you have a busy schedule. I like that you can play it for very short burst of time and your still in control of how much time you want to spend playing the game unlike most titles, definitely recommend

design, Bad, DO NOT BUY. Bad story design, needs multiple endings to feel complete. This (even at half price) feels like it's not worth buying.

game, excellent, It's an excellent game... I'd really love to see Taylor in another game, similar if not exactly like this one. Just with a new story. I genuinely cared about Taylor, and wanted to get him/her home. It's an amazing game, and I'm gonna play it through again. I was sad when I ended the story. Time for another round.

You help a stident escape from a space shop crash landing on a mysterious moon. Wish the dialogue options were more varied, ther were a few times the two input optiona fekt interchangeable.

idea, interesting, It's an interesting idea for a game, but it turns out you have very little choice really, if you attempt to change the path too much he rebels. Later trying to not get killed seems tricky, as choices are so arbitrary, sometimes only changing the strength of your response. I also found the main protagonist's voice a little unconvincing

game, simple, The writing and immersion are great with this simple text game... But there are bugs in the notifications and in a few of the story branches.
story, Nice, Nice, atmospheric story.

story, amazing, amazing story gonna buy number two
mission, first, At the first mission was a little slow but the second and third one was what really got me. I felt so connected to the imaginary person and I felt responsible for whatever happened to him. A phenomenal game.  A+

story, excellent, excellent story so far, my only complaint is that on my device, the text sometimes goes past the bottom of a text block, so i can't read the last few lines of what is being said. this definitely detracts from the story allot... if it weren't for that, this would be a solid 5 star story

game, based, This text-based game really makes you connected to the main character, and has a lot of super tense moments. Not just one of my favorite TBGs, one of my favorite games period.

game, EXCELLENT, This was an EXCELLENT game. it started good and only got better.
games, mini, fun and addicting with no mini games you have to do to proceed.
game, best, Bought this three years back, and still love it. I don't know why people are being so grumpy about the storyline; it is the best sci-fi text based game there is, in my opinion. The story is so engaging and makes you feel attached to the protagonist, unlike most out there. Buy it, you won't regret. Don't mind the negative reviews.

game, good, This was a ridiculously good game! The dialog was incredible and it was just awesome!
choices, different, Fun idea for a choose your adventure type game, but the execution is lacking. The game paths turned out the same even when I made different choices through the game play. Also does not notify me through Wear OS (though probably not the fault of the game).
adventure, enjoyable, An enjoyable adventure, for sure. I fel lt the urgency of thr character's predicament and was taken in by the story. I've only played through once, but I'm hoping there are some alternate paths I can take with Taylor to really flesh out the story and setting. Good work!!

story, Great, Great story! Love the way it works
breaks, short, This game is great for short breaks from work. If you don't stare at your phone all day, this game goes on for days. Interacting with Taylor can cause one to become fairly curious about what would happen to him. Although the jokes are not that funny (for me), but persevering through the jokes is another interesting factor of the game. Definitely going to get the sequel.

game, good, good adventure game.. was worth the price.
games, great, I decided to replay these great games and have found out they do not play well with Samsung's aspect ratio. A lot of the sentences are cut short, missing words to finish it what Taylor said. Also the buttons for for answers are scrunched up and the words overflow. Wish these would get fixed. Still a great experience though.

time, real, I like the real-time concept, but I don't think I've ever encountered a playable character that I wanted to kill more! He's rude, ungrateful, sarcastic and generally obnoxious, plus apparently can't think for himself. The developers overthought the writing - they tried too hard on the personality, and made it dislikeable. They should have stuck to straight, interactive storytelling, adventure book style. What, where, problem, solution. I don't want 8 messages in a row, mostly useless filler.

ending, forced, I've enjoyed my experience with this game but i was very frustrated with the forced ending and the lack of options at moments. The real time wait isn't very fun but it does add a little suspense. I liked it overall eventhough it had some problems.

time, long, Oh man i have been looking a game like this in a long time fun to play,keeps me on the edge of the seat,decision making that could change the course of the history of the game . Loved it.
edit, Other, I love this app/game!! I just hate when Taylor is "busy", I wish I could see whats going on lol!! Other than that it is very entertaining! edit: still fun in 2019 lol!
game, cool, Really cool game. A couple of the choices were not what I would like to do in either case, but it was not a hindrance to the gameplay, and didn't annoy me so much that I couldn't have fun. There were several times where I genuinely didn't know where the story would go depending on my choice, which added to the suspense when Taylor went silent. Great idea, good mystery. I would love to see more options at each crossroad, but I know how much extra work that would be.

hours, few, Well worth the $2. You can spend that at redbox and entertain yourself for a few hours or you can buy this and be entertained for days! I literally didn't want to put my phone down as things were coming to a conclusion!
game, Absolute, Absolute favorite game. I have all three; I wish they'd hurry up and release a fourth. These are fantastic, especally if you enjoy choce-based games. No matter how many times I play it, I always get emotionally attached and get so scared for Taylor through every step of their journey. 10/10 have played multiple times and will play again.

years, few, I played this years ago, and I reinstalled it tonight and started playing it again. I still loved it as much as I did a few years ago!
time, real, I enjoyed this interactive, real time story. Being forced to wait for messages, as you guide the protagonist, was the right call (albeit fast play and rewind options become available after the first play through). Note it's quite short, you don't have a huge amount of genuine options/alternatives and it's actually quite hard to kill the person you're guiding. Bear this in mind and the limited replayability it means and you won't be disappointed - it's a bit different and good, cheap fun.

game, Great, Great game, with one major flaw -- after the first day or so, Taylor refuses to do 99% of what you tell him to do. Your choices don't have much effect. He'll just ignore you or stall until your decision is rendered pointless. He also has a absolutely no survival instant, so you're constantly trying to convince him not to roll over and die. The story is great and so is the writing -- you just don't have much influence over its direction.

girl, old, After three days I uninstalled it. The game's premise is great, but Taylor is an idiot...seriously,..he is stupid beyond belief and that quickly gets annoying.  If Taylor were a 14 year old girl, it would be far more believable. There is nothing about his demeanor, dialog or decision making ability that would suggest that he is even remotely educated.   Also, the dialog feels more like he is simply narrating in real-time, which is counter intuitive to text messaging. At one point the messages were literally a play-by-play of him reaching for some food with a contraption he fashioned out of spare parts.   I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to get past the physical gymnastics that are require to perform such a task, while apparently typing at the same time.   Also, the interaction between you and this moron is stupefying. It didn't take long before I began to dislike Taylor...a lot! He is a boorish mental midget who struggles with unbelievably simple decisions; like going clockwise or counter-clockwise.   Lastly, Taylor is not only stupid, but he is meek. Seriously, quit whining about your whittle sore shoulder and man up! What a candy ass.

concept, Interesting, Interesting concept, but I wasn't able to get into this game as much as others have. During the initial playthrough I found myself a little impatient when the main character was off doing things like sleeping and not communicating with me. The thought of uninstalling it definitely crossed my mind during these prolonged downtime events. Also, I was very bothered by the unrealistic timing of the dialog. For example, there are times where the main character is in a panic and only has seconds to make a decision, yet he goes off on tangents and cracks jokes or tells side stories for the next minute or so. Lastly, I just wasn't able to really feel for the main character. I read many reviews before playing saying I should expect to really form a bond with the character. I honestly felt nothing the entire time. Game could be a little longer too.

spin, own, Aw man this was awesome!! I really cared about Taylor, I actually cried when she got to safety. (First playthrough, no deaths, aw yeah!!) I mean, I read her as a "she", but the gender is never specified, so Taylor could be any gender, which is awesome! Sort of lets you put your own spin on the character. Loved the plot, loved the world- and character-building, loved the descriptions. The only thing that slightly frustrated me was not being able to input my own communications and having to pick options, but I understand that otherwise it would have been hellish/impossible to code. I guess really it works quite well because I started to get frustrated that I couldn't be more positive for Taylor, so I got really emotionally involved. Really great!

days, few, Bought the game a few days ago, and I really really love it. The connection I had with Tyler was insane. I love the pick and choose scenarios, and the jaw dropping story. I will be buying silent night right after finishing this one, possibly recommend some photos here and there but overall, awesome game and I would recommend it üíØüëå

way, cool, It's a really cool way of delivering a story, and app ran perfectly on my phone. Most dialogue options only have one real option though and leads you to it. Sometimes you'll try to pick option B and be given an argument against it over and over til eventually it just says you're going to do option A. At one point this went for 4 attempts. Maybe there's other endings I missed but I tried replaying and picking the opposite choices only to find most of the time I was on the exact same track. Bit frustrating

book, bad, Story is clunky and some of the exchanges a bit nauseating. It's like a bad book. A lot of the 'decisions' are two versions of the same thing so actually not a lot of control. I like the idea but this wasn't as interesting as it should have been.

premise--, cool, It's a really cool premise-- you're in contact with a space explorer whose ship crashed on a planet. It's a choose your own adventure via conversations with them. It also takes place in "real time" meaning that you can't play the game all at once. The explorer will be "busy" and you could wait hours to hear from them. That made it feel more realistic. However, in certain threads of the gameplay, you will tell the explorer to do something and they will wind up doing whatever they want, which defeats the purpose of the game. Additionally, you could wait several hours for a reply only for it to be the explorer saying "I'm still alive can't talk!" And there isn't anything fun or interesting about the interaction and then you have to wait another several hours. Because of this I would say great premise, poor execution. Not really worth spending money on.

Compasses point to EARTHS magnetic North pole, so unless the moon your on is exactly.the same it's not gonna work!"

game, unique, Lifeline, a unique game like no other i have played before. Lifeline isn't just a game, it's an experience, an experience you will not forget any time soon. Taylor, the character of the game puts her life in your hands as the story goes on. This game makes you one of the characters. As the game goes on Taylor asks you questions, and you have to make decisions that can cause a major to minor turning point in the game. These decisions are not always easy and I wish you luck.

experience, best, The original Lifeline. I've played this game long ago, but to this day I remember it being possibly the best experience I have ever from playing a mobile game. I would definitely recommend everyone even remotely interested in interactive stories to give this a try. Btw, the direct sequel to this here is Lifeline: Silent Night, which isn't as long or good as the original, but still something I would recommend playing if you liked this.

job, amazing, I was initially wary about this game being entirely text based but the developers of the app did an amazing job at creating an interesting story and making a character that I felt really bad about when a decision I made eventually killed him.  In all I would recommend if you don't mind a tiny bit of reading.

game, heartwrenching, This was definitely the most heartwrenching game I have ever played in a LOOOONG time. I actually came to know Taylor and become friends with him I feel like. I know it sounds weird but thats what this game does to you.....the ending gave me goosebumps or at least the ending that I got, definitely gave me goosebumps....this was too amazing and perfect in every way....going back in in a few days...need a break, I lost a good friend...

way, good, I downloaded this on a whim and now Im totally hooked! So refreshing to play a "game" like this! The wait in between dialogue is tortuous in a good way! I find myself constantly checking my phone for the next notification of a message! I habe played through several times to explore all choices and see what the outcomes are. I will absolutely be purchasing the rest of the series. Please keep them coming!

The wait is part of the experience.  The only thing I don't like is the notification spam. You can get dozens of notifications at a time with this app. I would recommend a single notification like "New Transmission from Taylor" so you know when to go on the app.

the.game, Loved, Loved the.game. It has a captivating story that really makes you feel for the character and gives you choice on what happens. I do wish however that they would have explored more of Taylor's story, what he was doing on the Varia, what he is like, where he comes from. Also, sometimes Taylor's a butthead and he doesn't listen, which seems kinda like a cheap way to not write more story endings.

I loved it sooo much! The awesome thing is that not only can I play it again, but that there's more adventures for me and Taylor to experience üòâ Thank you so much for taking me on this EPIC experience! üòÇ

time, first, This is the first time I've ever played a game like this & I didn't think I'd really get into it but I did! I actually found myself wanting to hear back from "Cadet Taylor" & checking my notifications. I even went back to see what happens when I respond in different ways. Good game!! I'm off to play Lifeline: Silent Night now!

mix, right, Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Taylor's personality is the right mix of snark and worry and humour and vulnerability. Really brings out the mother hen and best friend in you. So glad a friend recommended this game to me! (plus I've always been an absolute sucker for space and science - I enjoy Taylor's little geeking out sessions). As a plus point - T's gender is kept ambiguous, so you could imagine 'em to be anything.

game, best, Arguably best indie game on Android (on par with Kingdom Rush).  The storytelling is genius. It brought me as a player so attached to Taylor. I felt like really need to help him out, to check him whenever he sent a message.  A breath of fresh air. Showed us story matters more than graphic.

story, interactive, This interactive story was amazing i loved the base if the story i would love to see more of these
minute, whole, Very compelling. Whenever Taylor would say "give me a minute" I would find myself waiting the whole minute. I managed to rescue him on the first try but the whole way I was sure he would not make it. I now on to the sequel....

story, Great, Great story that goes at your pace, whatever it is. Notification is not intrusive and text only feels like books that let you shape your own adventure. A must play for sci-fi fans?

interaction, best, One of the best interaction story-choice based game I've ever played. I never get a chance to getting bored to processing until the end of the story since Taylor is a realistic and friendly character. And he just made me want to do my best to help him out the moon alive! Definitely going to purchase the other two games of these &lt;3

days, few, I purchased this game a few days ago. It just stopped working today and refuses to restart. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it and I've cleared the cache etc. The game still doesn't work at all. Very disappointed.
game, Great, Great game.  With a  great story. Definitely worth the money.

horror, classic, The story with all its elements of science fiction and classic horror really keeps you enthralled amd wamting to know what's going to happen next during the pauses in story.  I've played through this twice already and can honestly say each of those two endings are unique enough to make you want to replay, but still in keeping with the story as a whole.
game, real, What am I missing. This game is horrible. No graphics no real game play just alot of reading. It's 2017 games shouldn't be like this. It's not a game it's more of a story that you can chose the path. I'm out.
game, great, This is a great game
game, best, I love love love this game. It is the best game I have ever played.  Only problem is its short. Maybe you could have something happen on the escape pod  and we can keep going. Edit: the lifeline series currently consists of 7 stories, all costing $3 each. Maybe have a bundle/season pass thing for cheaper, or at least group similar characters together, like the 3 stories with Taylor.

choices, available, While beautifully‚Äã executed, it lacks the depth usually associated with text-adventures. The story is predictable‚Äã and only 2 options per choices available.  The idea of waiting, notifications etc is a good one, but the game builds on it too much without providing anything truly substantial.

sense, added, I love choice games. Played a bunch, but none quite like this. Finished it in three days, and though there were times I was screaming at the character to finish breakfast faster or whatever, the time aspect was what gave this game an added sense of realism. For three days, my family has been asking for updates on my "spaceman". The story is great, the gameplay is great, A++.
plot, interesting, I absolutely love these games!   I love being these characters lifeline!   I love learning who Taylor is, helping him along the way. He's fun, he's so sweet and interesting to talk to in itself. Even without the interesting plot, I just enjoy talking to Taylor.   The plot is interesting too.   What I love the most is the game style. Looking forward to many more games!!! It's rare that I buy a game. It's even rarer that I buy every game they have on option!!

game, interactive, Text based/interactive book game. Pretty much you make decsions for this stranded person on the moon. The story starts off simple but slowly gets better over time. I wont say its amazing but for what its offers you,its a good game. If you like a good story,check this out

game, interesting, Really interesting game. But I wish it was more nerve wrecking like I want to feel how much trouble hes in. There humor in this game and the way he talks just kind seems like its another day for him. And some of the dialogue was pretty "corny",and "cheesy". But overall if you have the time its pretty good to waste time on.

night, first, Surprisingly really immersive. It's initially boring and waiting around for the next message sucks, but I would say by the time you hit Taylor's first night on the moon it's starts getting good, and keeps getting better and better until the end. I give it a 5/7, perfect score.

minutes, few, I bought this game sorta to be a time waster but in the few minutes I've played it has been very immersive. Just like talking to a person.
story, Great, Great story
time, excessive, I'm getting tired of hack n slash and p2w games that require excessive screen time. This game integrates with daily life so well. Pick up the story whenever, and let your imagination do the rest!

adventure, fantastic, It has been more than a year since I first played this, and the story seems to have developed quite a bit! It is a fantastic adventure and you really (surprisingly) start to care about the character, his choices, your choices and his survival! Gripping story played out over a couple of weeks for me. Well worth the money.

attempt, 5th, Saved Taylor on 5th attempt.Best story tho.Sometimes the choices you think was stupid was the choice that could save Taylor.But I'm wondering why this game needs access to all my accounts.

storyline, nice, I've been playing it a bit and it has a nice storyline and is very interesting. I just finished the game and its very interesting. And when Taylor dies for the first time (based on what you tell her to do) then you unlock fast mode which means no waiting. You also unlock the ability to rewind the story to any point, day, or question and then change your answer to the question as well.

story, good, That game is just awesome. Very good concept and appealing story.
clip, short, That will be great if i can get the art what taylor looks like it, and capt. Colby, and the rest of the crew, and valvara . i think it must be epic if there any short clip about the ending when taylor running tripping, deepresd, and then crying when he got disconnecting sytem message with player .
time, waiting, I enjoyed the simplicity of the game and the waiting time. The options could be developed better with probing questions but for a first time Thom rough it I enjoyed it.

game, worthwhile, To create a worthwhile interactive text based game, essentially all you need is to pay attention to is spelling, grammar, and punctuation, while offering an engaging storyline. What really became the deal breaker to me for this title was the unnecessarily too realistic wait times for the story's character to respond back to you. I get enough of that type of disappointment from real life texting. :(

story, multiple, I liked text adventures back in the day. This is a multiple choice tree-structured story rather than the type using objects and verb-noun commands. Good concept though. You play in spurts of just a few minutes with waiting time between. Good for fighting boredom while waiting for trains.

story, Good, Kept me interested to the end. Good story and creepy music set a suspenseful mood throughout but often conversations and decisions seemed linear like either choice would get you the same response/progress.

Good story and creepy music set a suspenseful mood throughout but often conversations and decisions seemed linear like either choice would get you the same response/progress. Enjoyable but wouldn't make me want to get the next one. Thanks to the developers.

game, Great, Recently purchased and just worked through to the ending. Great game with the "realtime" structure creating a good sense of drama and led to regular checks of my phone to aeeif anything had happened.  Only time the concept showed a small flaw were the time critical parts of the story where suspense was built up suggesting Taylor had only a few minutes to make a decision but I could wait hours to make my call. Clearly the limits of such a game prevent anything other than this but there could be an odd occasion thrown in where Taylor chased you for a decision to add to the feeling of urgency.  Definitely recommended though.

attempt, 2nd, I love this game so much! I loved helping Taylor through the journey, and managed to finish it on my 2nd attempt! (After accidentally rewinding it) anyway, I am definately recommending this to   friends!! I absolutely love the sci-fi and some of it freaked me out, but in an awesome way!!! Totally worth the money.

permissions, new, The game is loads of fun but now new permissions like access to my media flies after a bug fix update and no explanation for the permissions in the description prevent me from even thinking about updating. Game so far is 5 stars but the other I mentioned....
game, other, Lifeline is different from any other game on the app store markets it immerses you in the story, makes you acountable for the choices that are made makes you believe that you are Taylor's only chance at survival, and I love it.

cents, best, Made it to the end and I'm rightly thrilled and anxious to see what happens next...best 99 cents I ever spent...

Here's to another adventure with Cadet Taylor

thing, missing, Taylor's stories are the best written by miles. Only thing missing is that the story should carry over between games of the same series, akin to Mass Effect, Telltale Games etc.

memories, good, Superb. Saved Taylor on 1st attempt. Grew up with text adventures and thoroughly enjoyed it. Had a book when I was young called The Warlock of Firetop Mountain in which you choose scenarios to influence the ending, so brought back good memories of the genre. This is very well written and engaging. Bought next installment. Also tempted to go back and make some really bad decisions just to see what happens lol. Please keep the installments going :-)

ratings, decent, I like CYOA games, and this one sounded interesting and got decent ratings, but after a couple days into the game, still not much more going on other than deciding to eat breakfast or review some video (that is, the character watches, not you, this IS text based, after all). There really isn't much to do other than wait for long stretches, with occasional mundane choices, and Taylor isn't a very interesting character. Ultimately, found Lifeline to be plodding and tiresome. Uninstalled.

scenarios, other, A lot of fun. It'd be cool if there were other scenarios, like stuck in a blizzard, or on the side of the mountain, etc. A ton of potential.
person, real, This game was a recommendation by a friend. It's beautifully CYOA-TYPE story is more than I expected. It was compelling, even a bit surreal. The developer/writer really made it seem like it was a real person talking to you. Every conversation was fluid and your choices really were your choices. Whether Taylor lives or dies depends on you as a player, but more than that. Almost as if you were a friend across the eons looking out for him when he has no one.
game, best, This is the best game I've ever played, all because of the story.

dollars, few, I love how the time delays make it feel like you're really talking to a person. This game is very addictive and very good, I very highly recommend it. It is completely worth the few dollars it costs.
permissions, new, For an update that's just "bug fixes" why are there new permissions for in app purchases and access to photos/media/files with no explanation? The app description even says no in app purchases?
update, new, Very intriguing and well done. However the new update asks for in app purchase permissions even though the description system no in app purchases...
idea, Nice, Nice idea, and reminded me of the "Choose your own adventure" books I read as a child. Once it's done, though, that's it... I lost, I won... Not sure that's worth the money. Oh well.

play, first, Words cannot describe how happy I am that I bought this game. I just finished the first play through and I was completely invested in Taylors survival the entire time. I really liked that the astronaut had a gender ambiguous name so you can imagine Taylor as a boy or girl. After you beat the game you can backtrack and see what would have happened had you fail. Perfect. I loved stressing out over this game. (Taylor survived my first play.)

choices, different, Exciting. I actually found myself so engrossed in the story I was waiting on his responses so I could continue and see what happened next. Now I need to replay so I can make different choices!
sense, Same, I enjoyed the heck out of this! It is not usual that a game would capture my attention like this but I kept thinking about Taylor over the last almost a week I played this. Even my parents got into it, asking how she was doing and making the decisions with me. I am so excited to play the rest of the games!!! Taylor was a lot of fun to talk to and felt very real. She reminded me of a friend of mine actually. Same sense of humour. Overall it is worth way more than 2.69$ for the entertainment I got!

concept, great, This is a great concept that was executed excellently! If you move story and you enjoy being the puppet master this is the game for you!
game, average, At first, it starts off slow and seems like the average AI game. Then as the days progress and you wait for more messages, it slowly becomes more and more realistic. You catch yourself pending hard on decisions as they are life or death for your new found friend. Original and oddly intense for such a slow game. I would definitely recommend it.

way, interesting, This game presents itself in an interesting way and I actually like how there are time gaps built in. It helps build tension and realism. Gonna try the sequel now!
thing, only, I was very surprised by this game/story. Very well written. While some may not like the gaps in time (not allowing the story to continue for x amount of minutes, hours or days) it makes it more realistic.  The only thing I wish this series has is correct numbering (Lifeline 1-first game, Lifeline 2-second game, Lifeline 3-third game) or if they are based off of different characters (Lifeline: Taylor's Journey, Lifeline: Taylors Journey part 2, etc) but that's just me.  Now onto the next one, can't wait.

The only thing I wish this series has is correct numbering (Lifeline 1-first game, Lifeline 2-second game, Lifeline 3-third game) or if they are based off of different characters (Lifeline: Taylor's Journey, Lifeline: Taylors Journey part 2, etc) but that's just me.  Now onto the next one, can't wait.

time, real, I love the concept of having to wait real time, though others may not. It really feels as though you're communicating with someone, who only has you to talk to and it makes you really care about this person. It's great that it takes time to create this connection, that later on, you really care about this person's well-being and your choices affect that. I did make some bad decisions at first, but it just makes you want to come back, and think about better decisions. Awesome job.

story, Fantastic, Fantastic story. Very engaging. Definitely recommend
watch, smart, I got this as something to play on my smart watch and by the end I was deeply drawn into the character, concerned for his wellbeing and feeling impact over every decision that I'd made. Very well done, would definitely recomend

stuff, Next, This isn't so much a game than it is a book. Next gen stuff right here.
journey, emotional, This game was insane. Such an emotional journey, well worth the money. May be short, but so much depth in a dialogue based game!

comma, cheap, I'm pretty cheap comma, so spending any money on an app is a big deal for me. At first, it's interesting and entertaining, but the story feels relatively short and gets too drawn out at the end.

time, second, I just finished this for the second time after downloading all 6 of the games and it is just as awesome as before
fiction, new, A new age interactive fiction, deceptively drawing you in, uncannily believable and beautifully written. Excellent pacing and it fit really well into my days. Took two/three to complete. Slow bursts at first, but what a finale. Holy crap, so SO well done. What a hell of an ending. I wish there were more ways of responding, but I don't see how you could do that without sacrificing the smoothness of game play. Best little game I've played in a while. I'll absolutely be getting the rest.

character, main, I spent a couple days being legitimately worried for the main character. I found my self thought-spiraling on scenarios and possible outcomes. This game is delivered very well and the writing draws a reader in easily. This is exactly the kind of alternative to normal Mobile games that I need!

character, condescending, This condescending character makes everything harder and blows up your phone like a jealous insecure girlfriend.. you give him advice and he still does exactly what you told him not to do.. frankly this game is a waste of time and stress on people with actual problems in life. It's not fun to have a what seems to be an uneducated man with no hope on the other end of your screen. He doesn't listen and it's always something (even if it's his doing) simply unrealistic game

novel, asynchronous, Having an asynchronous visual novel run on the phone and message you via notifications is pretty neat. Wish it were longer, but then for the price it's also quite worth it. Update: Considering all the later entries, this one does it by far the best with it's comparatively long gaps between interaction and mostly autonomous character - it just feels more believable. Taylor is walking around doing things, we're only helping as needed.

story, interactive, The concept is not that new, to be honest, nothing more than an interactive story but the fact that you actually receive notifications like any other messenger makes it even more immersive. Just started today but I really like it so far. Just faced a few occasions where notifications didn't show up and it would be nice if they made the same sound as in the main UI, but it's really good anyway. I'm also pleased with the French translation. Will definitely try the other ones :-)

job, good, This game does a good job with the dioluage. The character actually has character and makes us care for him. The game also does a good job of making it seem like we are actually talking to someone stranded on a room. The story is mysterious and keeps you guessing. You are always wanting to figure out what's going to happen. I wish there was more parts where you have to research something in real life. I really liked that, but it only happens once. And the ending was kind of sudden(I know there are multiple)

Taylor has a wonderful personality and you will not easily forget about him. I have  to get the sequels! This isnt really my genre when it comes to games but it's certainly captured my heart!

This is a fantastic way of immersing someone in a game.

adventures, based, I like text based adventures but this one has one BIG flaw. In order to increase "immersion" they let you wait... In real time - all the time sometimes it's only one question you can answer before "Taylor is busy" again. This was so annoying that I lost interest.

people, real, I couldn't wait for the responses from Taylor, I've downloaded the rest of the games and I'm hooked. Starts to feel really life like. Sometimes I'd forget to message real people back but I'd go the extra effort to respond to the latest messages. Whiteout was my personal favourite. So good.

game, great, Clever involving story and design it's just a great game
let, biggest, I really hoped for more, but in the end I just thought the biggest let down was the story and narrative. There is so much rambling on and waffling that I just got bored of waiting for something to happen. The responses/questions that you could give Taylor were also limited that at times it felt very frustrating engaging in this fictional conversation.

game, best, I've played this game the story telling is great I wish there were a sequel to silence nigth the best game I've played I recommend it it it valued the dollar
effort, Engaging, Engaging and low effort
time, entire, I was wanting to know what was happening next the entire time. I just don't know how to actually get a noise or vibration for a new notification.

game, gripping, It's definitely a gripping "game" especially if you go through it real time. Unfortunately I turned on the fast mode because I managed to get the protagonist killed on the first night. I didn't want to wait through the same night. Well, I ended up playing the whole story in fast mode and realized the playable minutes of this game is less than 2 hours. You can replay it if you want but it kinda loses it's appeal when you know what's gonna happen.

game, mobile, I was,skeptical at first, paying a dollar for a mobile game, but I haven't even finished the game yet and I'm already satisfied with it, definitely worth a $1 and its a great story so far, immersive  and its actually cool getting messages from Taylor with new questions and situationsüëç great job on this! I'd love to see more like it from the same creators

games, free, Normally I stick to the free games on here, but I saw this game mentioned on tumblr and it's totally worth it, the story is suspenseful and I am totally looking forward to playing again so I can see what happens with the other choices.

experience, wonderful, This game was outstanding the beginning was kinda slow but the way everything unfolded in the end gave me chills and kept me guessing if tailor was gonna make it off the moon or not. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to playing the next games

answers, silly, Really failed to engage. Didnt enjoy the sarcasm and silly answers. Sounds like it gets better reading some other reviews, but didn't really want to hang around for that long... It was becoming like an annoying friend messaging you.

bantering, sarcastic, I realise that I'm in the minority here but really why do Americans think sarcastic bantering is funny? I'm over waiting for another "witty" observation. A game like this is about dialogue and it just doesn't work. I don't find it believable that such a character would be in this situation. But I guess it's just me.

way, unique, Very unique way to tell a choose-your-own-adventure story.  I was thinking about Taylor whenever I couldn't check on him at work.  Glad I gave it a try and I'll definitely try the others.

time, first, This would be the first time I enjoyed a choice game. It was hard not to get engrossed in the story, especially towards the end. The only drawbacks for me were the limited pathways and the short plotline. But the story was good nonetheless. WARNING: This is a choice game in which you wait for notifications after your choices (i.e., immersion factor).

choices, different, Worth every cent! I love it! It can be longer if you make different choices :). Kudos for the dev team!
story, Interesting, I never thought I would be into a game like this, but I not only got myself hooked, I got a few friends hooked as well. Interesting scifi story. Simple, yet important decisions along the way. I played it several times just to see how thing could play out differently. I will definitely be following this game's later chapters.

game, good, I got hooked at the start,really good game.Recomended
dialogue, drawn, I really can't this guy's writing. In any of these lifelines the dialogue tries way to hard to be personable and charming with annoying drawn out dialogue.
installment, first, The first installment in a legendary series. I recommend every title in the franchise

story, whole, This game/App thing is well worth the 1 dollar. I actually feel like someone out there is talking to me and I'm helping him/her. Also its amazing how what 1 differ text can change the whole story to fast paste or slow paste. The first time my astronaut froze to death ;-; I'm getting further but it's moving alot faster now that I changed up the beginning. I hope that for all of you that found this review helpful and support this game and hopes that this game will expand and hopefully make sequels and so-on

reader, avid, The storyline didn't grab me, but maybe that's because I'm an avid reader and simple plotlines like this seem a little dull. I'd prefer more options but oh well. What really annoyed me though was the constant stream of notifications I got at once (I'm playing on slow-paced!). I would love the option to disable notifications, time how often I get them or at least only put one saying that Taylor had responded and you needed to answer to him/her (I think it's a her). I hate the fact that the story seems to only give you one direction it wants you to go‚Äîif you go an incorrect path, he/she's constantly telling you if you're sure or that he/she thinks otherwise. I've tested this out several times on several different places and I always die when I stick with said path of him/her telling me to not choose that path. Then there is also the fact that all the responses are so similar! For example, I've read the words 'Are you okay?', 'What happened?', 'Are you sure...' more than a hundred times! It's irritating when you only have those two responses after his/her long chunks of speech. I didn't hate it, though I didn't like it either. I tried to make this  constructive

loop, odd, I found the character annoying and the choices often  seemed to be trivial. Also the odd loop where the story continues with the alternative option once your choice has scrolled through. I would enjoy it more if there were more significant choices to make and the character waffled on less.

Also the odd loop where the story continues with the alternative option once your choice has scrolled through. I would enjoy it more if there were more significant choices to make and the character waffled on less.
one, next, Loved this very much, never played anything like it before.  Was on holiday while it was running so had to check once I got back to the hotel.  Now onto the next one, Whiteout.  Another good one, hope to play them all.
reason, only, This game feels too short. The only reason it would go for 2+ days is that sometimes you have to wait several RL hours for the game to advance. The story is not very good but it is also not bad.

game, brilliant, A brilliant game that's fun and interesting.
time, real, Choose Your Own Adventure, on your smartphone. Easy to play a little at a time, if you want to immerse yourself in the "real time" concept, or you can forego that altogether and play it as a CYOA book, all in one go.
choices, most, Nothing happens and the writing sucks.  And most choices don t affect the story.
adventure, own, Loved the return to choose your own adventure and the real time notifications were a nice touch.

CYOA, fun, At first it seemed kinda cute, a fun little CYOA but the more that I played, the more I got genuinely invested, to the point that I was getting worried about my decisions. Very well made and well worth it.

person, real, Its easy to get connected to Taylor. Seeing how you have to wait for him/her to respond, making it feel as though theres a real person there. It makes beating the game all the more fun
game, great, Have a lot of fun playing this one, a great game
job, fantastic, Taylor feels so real, you guys have done a fantastic job. For me this is an emotional game sometimes.... Because Taylor will face all the consequences of my advice. But really guys, this is to be one of those games i won't forget ever.

way, new, It is refreshing to have a game that has found a new way to tell a story and emphasizes the choice of the player.

concept, Interesting, Interesting game concept. Its not what I really look for in a game because you can't sit and play it for longer than 10 minutes at a time, but the concept of playing in real time is clever and quite well done. It's good at being what it is, but it wasn't really for me.

cent, single, This story must be one of the best I've ever had the opportunity to read and play. This game is worth every single cent. Thanks a lot for the 1st title, I'm already playing the 2nd one. Let's see where's Taylor headed next

game, great, In truth, It's more than just a game... it's an experience. Gamers and non gamers alike will enjoy it. I only played through it once but I found it genuinely interesting. It starts off a bit slow but it really picks up towards the end. I actually started to develop a connection with Taylor and I felt responsibility for having him/her killed. Anyways, great game! I think I'm going to replay it so that I can get a better ending.

game, Great, Great game. If you die just rewind and try again!
way, good, got him killed. dammit. actually feeling sorry for leading him to his death. i'm in Day 3 and so far the story has been engrossing and very well paced. unexpectedly funny in a good way and witty with just the right dose of sarcasm. takes quite a chunk of RAM but it's worth it. so okay, no more playing around Taylor, this time i mean business!

games, best, This is one of the best games I ever played on Android. That's probably because I don't usually enjoy computer games and because this isn't a usual computer game either. I would rather call it an interactive book where you make decisions on how the story should continue. Thus it's really not for fans of traditional games but might be interesting for people who don't usually play (like me) and especially for book lovers.

attempt, interesting, An interesting attempt to modernize interactive fiction, through pseudo-realtime messaging, this game is a must try. The novelty alone should definitely carry you through your first play through. The only complaint I have is that the main character seems a bit too passive, but I suppose that is why you are guiding her about. Overall, an excellent game.

story, own, This is a bit like a choose your own adventure story, mixed with an adventure style game. I love the real time aspect of it and kept looking forward to seeing when Taylor would get back to me.

games, other, It was so good. Not like other games, but one of the best I've ever played. Highly recommended.
hours, few, The fact that I can interact and give choices and it impacts the story is awesome I've only played for a few hours but I really feel like I'm part of the story, great story, I will definitely be purchasing the sequels... Great job Devs!!!

watch, android, 1st being able to play the game from a android watch is awesome... The story is great, like a "choose your own adventure" book... but what's awesome is the main character will communicate with you at random times as he's busy... sometimes you will wait hours to hear back which makes it feel like hes actually performing the tasks he's talking about in real life... very cool

adventure, weird, You get attached to the character and you get swept on a weird adventure. Best 2.99 I have ever spent on the play store.
download, best, I love it, it is the best download it now.
story, great, Such a great story. Mystery and thriller, in an android choose your own adventure, what's not to love? All the people complaining"boring" "it's not a game it's a book". "If you want to be bored, just read a book".. Its an interactive choose your own adventure game/story. Seriously, don't you even bother to look at the screen shots? Anyway, great game.

others, most, Very well written.   I played white out first and liked it so much I went back to try the first one.   As with the other holding one star off all because a game like this should be able to be moved to your SD card most others are.  This adds up space.   Any game should be move able to SD card without root as far as I'm concerned.   Other then that I highly recommend this entire series.   Thanks for the great games.

story, Amazing, Amazing story & writing. Look forward to next one!
games, based, I love this game. It reminded me of the text based computer games in the 80's when I was just a kid. The scene from the moive, 'Big' where he is playing a game of this genre popped into my mind.
kid, Listen, At first Taylor was really making me angry. "Listen kid just shut up and do what I tell you too!" However nearing the end of the story the intensity and the action really picked up and I couldn't help but to root for the little science nerd. Will be buying the other games in this series. 3 Minute Games have a customer for life.
