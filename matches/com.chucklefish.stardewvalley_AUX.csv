's, game, fun, It, Picked this up out of boredom, lemme tell you, for the price, this is worth your money. It's a fun game you can play anywhere. Definitely recommend stardew valley
was, tgat, sad, it, Wish it was multiplayer sad tgat they siad no to it would play it more if it was waiting for next update for willys boat....other then tat great game
is, game, great, This, Cozy gaming win. This is a great game to play in the few minutes I get while watching my babies. It's low stress and chill, but I can still go and kill things in the mines when I feel the need.

's, game, solid, It, It's a solid game that gets boring after a little while. Good game though.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game you can have on android
is, game, great, It, It is a great game but when you finished all the main story it just then feels old and crave for something new. I think it needs a Online multiplayer mode that you can interact with other people.
be, play, local, their, Really love this game and would love for their to be maybe a local play or 1-4 people can play together since it's supposed to be a small community. But still Id love local because then I can work on my farm with 3 or less of my friends or maybe my siblings!!!
is, successor, worth, It, This is, for all intents and purposes, the apex of farming games as of 2021. It is a worth successor to the Story of Seasons / Harvest Moon franchises.
is, game, GREAT, This, This is a GREAT game you can start a farm, a family and create and make your own farm! And so much more. Can't wait for new updates on mobile!
's, people, stardew, it, it's stardew valley people, it's in your phone!!! no doubt it will left others "farming" game eat dust. i ask but one... please add mods support, maybe become downloadable in game. Edit: drop from 5 to 1, why? It's chuckelfish, it's been month without update whatsoever, not even 1.5 will ever hit mobile.
is, game, perfect, This, This is the perfect game for someone who wants a relaxing experience playing a game anywhere they want. I am super pregnant and when I'm tired or at a doctor's appointment I can play this game and feel much better. I'll probably play it while I'm in labor!
is, RPG, good, it, Why wouldn't you want to buy and play this game it is such a good farming RPG i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT and the mood it sets is amazing the only thing is that i would like if there were more npc's to marry but i would rate it 100/100 if i could and i just can not wait till the 1.5 update comes out to mobile!!

is, one, big, That, I have bought this game on every console I owned. This game never failes to disappoint but to newcomers, this game is way better on console. But! That is one big BUT... this version still serves its overall premise and still holds true to the story and gameplay. You can even use a Blue Tooth controler of you don't like the tapping controls. I just haven't discovered what update this version is on, so things may be missing from this particular version.
is, air, fresh, This, Exactly what it states it is. Developers do not oversell, misrepresent and present events that do not happen in-game. This is a fresh air considering the incredible number of false adverts these days. Does not force in app purchase. Worth every penny and I'll buy it even if its 2x more expensive.
is, game, awesome, This, This is an awesome game. There is so much more to do than there is in Animal Crozsing New Horizons.
is, game, amazing, This, This is a amazing game!!
's, game, great, It, It's a great game but I'm disappointed that the app has yet to recieve the most recent update to Stardew Valley that is available on PC and the games creator is already creating a new game before the old one is updated across all platforms. It would be nice if we had the update on mobile before the end of the year.
's, game, only, it, Amazing game. Seriously there's nothing wrong with it , it's the only game you'll ever need. Now I just need the 1.5 version for mobile üôèüôè
is, game, favorite, this, Absolutely love this game. So enjoyable to play. My only suggestion would be to add more post game content. I also wish there was cross save available across multiple platforms. Lastly, please consider making the mobile version multiplayer! Other than that, this is my favorite game at the moment! üñ§
's, fun, more, it, Please have a multiplayer on mobile phone, some people don't have a personal computer to play a multiplayer. Pleaseee I really want to play with my friends. This game is awesome and we really love playing it but it's much more fun to play together. Hoping for an update to you soon!!! FYI, I'm from Philippines and most people here isn't rich and don't have a personal computer/laptop including me. You created this awesome game and I believe in your skills to make a multiplayer on mobile phone. <3
is, game, best, This, This is the best farming video game ever, I played this on my phone and switch and I love it, this game will always have a space in my heart. üíôüíôüíô (Also, if you don't like this game cause of "lack of content", remember this game is made by one person, ONE!!!)
is, game, fun, It, Very enjoyable game. Just when you think you have played it all, something new surprises me. It is a very fun game to play. Easy and very well done. Im looking forward to the new update on this and the new game you made.
is, game, good, this, I love stardew Valley it is one of my favorite games. I LIke this game because there is no ads! People normally don't like ads so this is a really good game for your child to play!üòäüôÇ
's, Ô∏è, great, it, It is great its like real life and you get to have a family like you have to start a family to help you around the farm and it's actually really great ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
is, game, beautiful, This, This is the most beautiful game I've ever played ü§ó
is, WAY, more, THIS, I don't rate apps or games normally, but I LOVE this game, my best friend told me I should download it and I was skeptical because farm games are always so boring, but THIS is WAY more than just farming. It's romance, strategy, great story line, and you have SO many things you can do. Each NPC has their own vibe, and you can give gifts to them to become friends and maybe even more than that. They have likes and dislikes too. I am on my 3rd year (in game) and I've been playing for a week now.
am, fan, huge, I, I am a huge fan of Harvest Moon and this game is a great reminiscent of it. I love that this game keeps all classic fun aspects and adds things that I have always wished were available on the game.
's, game, cute, it, well worth the money! it's a cute and fun game to play, I've already done 70 hours. it is a little repeatitive but that's the charm and its easy to play.
is, repeatitive, little, it, well worth the money! it's a cute and fun game to play, I've already done 70 hours. it is a little repeatitive but that's the charm and its easy to play.
's, word, best, That, Incredible. That's the best word for it really. One guy, making such an amazing game like this. The PC version IS better yes, and if you can get that one. But for me, my pc version crashes regularly so this version is a god send. Stardew is my favourite game of all time. Abigail and Leah are my waifus, and I wanna hug Sebastian. Thank you Eric
's, thing, same, it, The year is 8. Day 25. Winter. Cold. Freezing cold. My husband won't stop leaving me alone with the children. Day in, day out it's the same thing over and over. Gather my crops, water my crops feed the animals, gather up the slimes, sell, sleep, repeat. I think I'm slowly going insane. I finished every task, befriend every unnaturally friendly towns people. I walk to the middle of town and shout at the sky...WHERE HAS THE UPDATE GONE. But alas, it's left us...AND SCENE. *Takes a bow*
's, place, only, it, This game had been a great stress reliever for me, it's the only place I actually feel productive. I really hope the mobile version gets the 1.5 update like the pc version had for a while now. Please bring the 1.5 update to mobile!!!!
's, app, good, it, So when I first got this app I was so excited because YouTubers were talking about so I thought it was really cool. But when I downloaded this with my gift card it didn't seem to work and screen stayed how it looked. I opened this app from the app store and it worked. I honestly thought I would be better. Also I am used to playing with arrows pointing up and down aka like minecraft. Or like roblox bc I play roblox a bunch. But it's probably because I bought this on moblie. But it's a good app!
are, access, difficult, They, Awesome game. My only complaint is the fishing mechanics. They are ridiculously difficult and hinder access to game play. I'm stuck searching for fish I need in the trash.
is, dropping, jaw, This, This is jaw dropping for a one man developed game! From farming to mining and combat, everything in this game is in depth and rewarding. Worth $4.99 and more. Recommended
's, game, good, It, It's a pretty good game I could play it all day, but I do wish it had Co-op on mobile I'd like it a lot more if did, but over all it's good üëç
is, game, good, it, I love this game! It has a lot of choices and careers to choose from. I love speedrunning Stardew with my brother and racing him to finish all the content. But I am still waiting for the 1.5 update on mobile. Besides that it is a really good game.
is, game, best, this, Beautiful, played on pc, takes a bit to get use to it on the phone but honestly this is the best game for anyone. Cannot wait for 1.5 on mobile
'm, playthrough, 10th, I, Always have and always will love this game, amazing story, amazing characters, amazing mechanics, amazing everything really. I'm on probably my 10th playthrough and I still find new stuff, although I don't really like mobile controls (console is the best experience so far) but it's an amazing game to pass time.

is, game, best, this, I wish I could give it more than 5 stars, this is the best mobile game, hands down. Pay the $5 or whatever to own it, it's so worth it! Tons of side quests & hidden gems, & YOU control the timing & storyline!! I play it as often as I can. Counting down the days til you guys put out the new Chocolatier game so I can play that too! ü§ç

is, masterpiece, beautiful, this, Fun harvest moon type game, for only 5 dollars, this is a beautiful masterpiece
Is, game, fun, this, I have this game on my tablet. I think this Is a really fun game. The thing is tho I can't figure out how to fix the broken building. But it still is an amazing game to play

is, game, fun, it, Great game i am on year 20 on one of my saves only thing i would like is for the 1.5 update or at least the perfection rating for mobile since some people can't afford to buy the steam or nintendo switch versoin other than that it is a fun game
is, game, best, this, I've been playing a lot of single player farm simulation type of game. and this game is without a questions, is the most exciting and enjoyable game amongst every other farm simulation game. Theres a few reason for everyone to play this game. First, the price is affordable. It's not that pricy for this kind of game. Secondly, the storyline is fun and acceptable. And last, you can play it with what ever way you want! Trust me, this is the best game that i ever play on mobile. Pubg is not a match.
's, game, fun, It, It's reallly a fun game though it has some bugs and glitches but is there a game that doesn't have one but concerned ape you should reconsider adding multiplayer mode and cross-play if much possible, all in all it's a great game

is, game, good, It, It is a really good game but it needs multiplayer because it get boring some time.
's, escape, great, it, It's not very complicated it's fun and it's a great escape from the rest of the craziness going on in this world
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but please, we've been waiting so long for 1.5 update and multiplayer function especially! I checked the forums and people have been asking for multi on mobile since 2 years ago! Please make it happen :(
is, game, favorite, this, I have been playing this for awhile, and I LOVE IT! The only thing Is SUGGESTING! Not complaning, suggesting! I would really say you should add co-op and multi-player to mobile/chrombook! I would love to play with my siblings and all that. But, as I said. I love it! I would definetly say this is my favorite game out of most of my games, and. There's a lot of them! Over-all, if someone asked me; 'Hey! what adventure roleplaying game to you recoomend?' I would say THIS! Over-all, this is great! <3
's, game, great, it, Just get a switch or play on PC. Pref PC it's a great game.
be, decision, great, it, overall it's good, very nice 'old school' graphics and storyline, attractive gameplay. but the thing i missed is the ability to move to canary island, which is very good to play if it was added to the mobile version. if i can get the updates, i think it'll be a great decision to give full 5-Stars to developer.
be, rating, actual, that, Very good adaptation, very faithful to the console/PC version, only real criticism is that fishing is 1000 times more difficult and that was my specialty so if I'm having a hard time with it then most other people will struggle. If I could give 4.9 that would be my actual rating.
is, game, beautiful, this, So worth it I've had this game since It came out and now it's on mobile devices this is a beautiful game even though its just pixels its amazing üëè
is, game, great, this, So this is a great game and there are some events that happen at night like the comic one that it's it's a bad and good event and yea that's all I got to say!
's, event, bad, it, So this is a great game and there are some events that happen at night like the comic one that it's it's a bad and good event and yea that's all I got to say!
's, game, wonderful, it, I think it's a wonderful game.
be, breaking, stressful, it, This has been one of my favourite games for YEARS. When I heard it was going to be on mobile I got it instantly. I love this game, there's an amazing story and it's so personalizable, immersive, and just fun. It's generally calming, but there's times where it can be stressful, heart breaking, loving, and so much more. I honestly do not know one person who doesnt like this game. This is my like 20th time playing it/beating it and I'm still not tired of it. Seriously play this, it won't disappoint

is, game, great, It, I think started valley is a great game. With the fishing to the events to the farming etc. It really is a great game it would be five stars if it was not for the buggy and lag items and sometimes it just is like a lag hole but a really good game would recommend.
is, game, good, It, It is a very good game
's, game, great, it, Honestly one of my all time favorites, it's a great sim game, worth the purchase. I have the steam version and I absolutely love it, 10/10 game! Just waiting for Ginger island.
's, game, sim, it, Honestly one of my all time favorites, it's a great sim game, worth the purchase. I have the steam version and I absolutely love it, 10/10 game! Just waiting for Ginger island.

being, game, great, it, This game is one I have had for a long time on my console and wanted it for my phone as well, due to it being a great game and one worth the small price tag you can't go wrong with getting this game, you'll love the whole aspect of relationship building, farm development, battling through the mines for valuable resources to upgrade your farm to reward you financially, all from dhe comfort of your own phone and from anywhere you are in the world.
's, game, great, It, I love it but when will the mobile he catch up to the PC version? I've pretty much beaten the game in 100 hours but the more I look up the more I see about version 1.5, that isn't on the mobile version. Just wanted to to know if 1.5 is ever coming. It's a great game tho.
's, game, nice, it, basically it's a nice game, but it could be the best game if you combine it to life simulation game as well.. where their children will inherit the land and proceed with the mission.

's, sim, great, It, I'm personally amazing that CA managed to fit his entire game into the mobile platform. It's lovely, a great farming sim where you can get immersed in your inherited farm and start a new life, even if it is a virtual one. However, I can't offer that 5th star only because of a personal preference- I don't think this game should be played on a phone because it can be a little more frustrating. Tablet? Maybe. Computer or console? Absolutely.

is, game, relaxing, It, I played Stardew Valley on pc first and downloaded this when it came out. I was surprised to find that it was the same as pc and I am very happy about that. It is a super relaxing and enjoyable game that always seems to have something new to do. Worth the $ for sure!
is, problem, only, that, I absolutely love this game but the reason I give it 4 stars is because I would like to do muliplayer with my bff in lockdown but we could not but that is my only problem overall great game one of my favourites
is, game, awesome, This, This is an awesome evergreen game, just a hint for android players: When trying to water plants with your water jug and if it auto switches to scythe and removes your plants, kindly observe these plants are gone and turned to yellow colour. Hope this helps.

is, game, ideal, This, This is my ideal game. Self-paced, relaxing. The game play is very simple, yet there the storylines add a lot of depth. You can race to accomplish goals and get rich in a short amount of time, or just kick back and feed your chickens and cows and feel perfectly content. I've been playing for a couple of years now, and it's still my go-to game when I want to spend time just relaxing and feeling happy.
's, player, multiple, it, it's a fan game yet no multiple player its kinda unfair since some of us don't have any money to either buy a computer or switch it be much more better if you add a multiple player choice so other can finally play with their friends plus it can attract more players that way unless you did this on purpose so other people we'll just the game on their computer and switch just so they can be with their friend smart move yet quite unfair
's, game, good, It, It's a good game.
is, game, addictive, This, This is the most addictive game I've ever played on my phone!
's, game, great, it, If you don't already know stardew, then it's a great game on its own and easily worth the money on every platform. My main concern with the mobile port was how they would handle the dramatic change in control scheme. But surprisingly, this is one of the best PC-to-Mobile ports I've ever seen. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and besides a couple inxredibly minor issues that I can't think of a feasible solution for, it's perfect. Can't reccomend enough.
is, game, best, This, This is the best game i ever played I love the story and the endless game.
is, deal, huge, which, I love Stardew on PC and I'm so happy I can now bring it with me wherever I go!! There are a few issues unfortunately. I can't seem to figure out how to remove bait from my pole. Also my character doesn't choose the fastest route when I pick a spot to walk to. In fact, she'll sometimes go completely out of the way to go to the chosen spot. I have to micromanage the fastest path, which isn't a huge deal; a minor inconvenience. I also can't wait for updates that bring us closer to the PC version.
is, game, favorite, It, This game is MASTERPIECE. It is so relaxing for farming type game. You can do so much things while waiting for your crops to grow such as mining, fighting monster in dungeon, foraging, fishing and develop friendships with the villagers. It is my favorite game so far. However, the game takes so long to update and we're missing some of the feature that already exist in other device platforms like Ginger Island and Multiplayer mode. I will surely change my rate if developers will update it soon. TY
is, game, great, This, Same game quality as its on pc. Maybe there is a little struggle in tapping or rotating some furnitures but still manageable. If there is one thing I want to add is that the android version could cope up with the latest version in pc. It is more diverse and eccentric and will help for the future plan of players that last til end game. This is a great game. One of my favorites üëç
are, needs, special, who, Bought this for my kids who are special needs and it's not friendly for anyone with special needs and health and mental health problems the game even after the last update isn't worth the stress and since mods are used for cheating on the phone's and pc clearly can't play any games honestly
is, game, amazing, It, It is an amazing game that is quite chill and well worth the money
