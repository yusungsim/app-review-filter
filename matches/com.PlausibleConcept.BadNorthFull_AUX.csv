are, boys, old, that, I must be missing something really spectacular. Either that or these are 12 year old boys leaving the lunatic-esque 5 star reviews of an otherwise plain game that their parents unknowingly paid for.
is, time, real, It, Super polished game where you micromanage up to 4 units to defend your island against Vikings. Your units and vikings units have a class, which defines their strength and weakness (pikes, shields, bows). It is real time but with slow motion and tiles when you select a unit. It is very tactical. You jump from island to island, purchased by the Vikings (think FTL), so you need to choose and optimize your battles to gain time. And the game is beautiful ‚ô° 5 stars easy.
was, game, awesome, It, It was an awesome game!
is, grabage, pure, This, My progress was reset to zero out of the blue. This is pure grabage.
's, strategies, own, it, A game where micromanagement of even the smallest timings make the difference between losing or winning a fight. The game throws new challenges at you progressively, but does tend to get a bit tedious and grindy around the higher turns. Every map is something new, every island has it's own strategies. 10/10 would buy again
's, game, premium, it, Thought the game was going to be simplistic and one dimensional, but it seems to have much more depth than meets the eye. Only gets better as you progress and allows for diverse play-styles and tactics to be utilitzed. Been having a great time with this one! Easily recommended, it's just perfect for a mobile game. The fact that it's a premium game (pay once for full access) without having a single microtransaction within it, makes me love it even more. Kudos to the devs, much appreciated.
's, babe, great, It, You can't save, so what's the point. It's a great babe but you can't save. You see , you can't save progress so you can't advance the progress of the game.
's, game, awesome, It, It's an awesome game, love the art style and great combat style. The only problem I have is it won't save my progress at all.
is, game, good, it, I do think the game had a lot of potential and user it to its highest point it is a really good strategy game and quite interesting however I do believe it needs more spice like more upgrades for the units a backstory and even a multi-player mode but until then I don't think I'll be playing
's, game, hardest, It, Love this game, keeps me entertained. It's not the hardest game but it definitely has its challenges. Super cool
's, game, good, It, It's a very good gorgeous game but gets stale very quickly. It need different game modes and updates to keep it fresh and enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend buying it until they have added other game modes, otherwise you'll likely play it once or twice then stop.

is, game, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic game. Great style to the art and music, great game play. No ads, no daily quests, nothing else to buy. Great replayability. It had me exclaiming out loud as good and bad things happened, and that was on "easy" difficulty.
is, game, awesome, It, It is an awesome game, my only problem with it is that everytime I open the app I have to restart the game from scratch, so I can't pick up my progress from the last game I was playing and even when I have completed campaigns in the past it hasn't saved that I have.
is, game, good, It, It is a very good game that I highly recommend to rts fans.
is, game, wonderful, it, Good game, bad optimizing. Overall this game is quite pleasant, it has a unique and cool artstyle, and decent gameplay, it is a wonderful strategy game and i have no complaints on the game itself (yet.) However, the optimization for mobile seems to be lacking, as the rampent game crashes made it nearly unplayable in a campaign, now this wouldnt have been that bad, but the fact that each time it crashed it would reset a portion of my campaign progress, made this a bad experience for myself.
's, shame, real, It, Game breaking bug prevents saving progress. It's a real shame. This looks like a lot of fun and the first couple levels were great. Unfortunately it's not playable at all in its current state as you have to start over every time you close the app.
's, quality, good, it, I love this game, the controls translate to touchscreen very well, the gameplay is simple and fun, and it's pretty good quality. This would be a 5-star review, HOWEVER, this game has a crippling save bug. It's only just started happening to me. 3 times in a row my save just gets deleted as soon as I quit the game. It doesnt matter if you leave during a battle, exit to main menu, or close the game. You lose your save file and all your time you spent on it.
is, game, exceptional, This, This is an exceptional defense game with sweet graphics and cool sound effects. I she enjoyed playing the game. Pros, graphics, sound effects, scrolling in and out, challenging, easy to play. Cons, it's hard to remember all of the saved attributes that you can gain during the game including the bonuses to your commanders. It takes a while to play and get good at it but it is enjoyable. I don't think it's nearly as good as polytopia, but still replayable.
is, version, horrible, This, This is a horrible version of bad north it constantly crashes and I lose islands worth of progress fix the bug
's, game, good, It, It's a good defence game! So far it's basically a challenge and so good for a pc game.
's, micro, adorable, It, I absolutely loved this game. It's an adorable and fairly challenging micro-RTS game that's well worth your money. Tons of customization and nuances. It works so well on my Galaxy Note 10 with the stylus. My only issue is that my 8bitdo n30 pro 2 controller does not work for this game at all even if controller support is available. I won't knock points off it just because it's a very fun game. Please fix the controller issue üòÅ

was, game, best, it, The game took me about 5 hours to finish, which felt about right for this game. The game makes you think and be tactical to make your troops effective and keep them safe. There are multiple difficulty options so it should be too easy/hard for most people. My only suggestion to the devs would be to perhaps have the availability to play through the game again with your upgraded troops at a harder difficulty. Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was the best mobile game I've played in about a year.

's, game, mobile, it, I love this game! It is amazing. There are some lag spikes and such but it's a mobile game. The only thing in my opinion would be cross platform multiplayer. Say... Each player gets 2 commanders?
's, game, nice, It, NOT WORTH SPENDING MONEY UNTIL BUG IS FIXED. It's a really nice game and addictive but have to start from the beginning every time which makes it very frustrating. Need to fix asap and will happily edit my review at that point
is, game, best, This, This is the best game ever... The first time I watched a YouTuber played this game... I always wanted to play it on HP... Now I can play the game that I loveüëçüëçüëç
're, unit, best, they, The best mobile game I've ever played. Mind your spears, they're your best unit.
is, game, good, The, The is good game because is fun and it make you us your brain
be, game, fun, what, Nice attempt at what could be a fun game, but it just CANNOT save your games correctly. I've yet to get very far at all because of bugs and glitches with my games. Once it loaded me at the correct place, but it took all my upgrades away, so I was dead in the water. Other times it just crashed my file and deleted it. Another I reached a check point, died, attempted to reload at the check point I reached, but it took me back to the previous point so I lost all of my progress. Terrible.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game
is, game, fun, it, Have hit an unfortunate bug that effectively renders the game unplayable, which is unfortunate given it is otherwise a very fun game. Gets stuck in an endless loading screen (while the game is "generating islands") for saved games of difficulty "normal" or higher. A quick search reveals this is a very common bug. Will be seeking a refund.

is, game, addictive, This, This is an addictive game. The graphic is simple, yet attractive. I only complain the campaign system, which can delete our progress after there ia no turn. Seriously, after upgrading the commanders?
is, game, great, it, Great at First Starts off amazing, it really is a great game. However once you get deeper in the game the giant archers show up and really ruin the game. Most units have a counter however these units don't making them pretty game breaking. They have ridiculous range, high damage, and knockback. Something that might help is to balance that unit or at least add a feature that allows comat to slow (like it does when a unit is selected)or can be pause so you can see whats going on and how to react
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game. Doesn't develop so much. Upgrades in the game are pricey and money hard to earn. The game itself is quite challenging. It's ok. A good game.
is, game, fun, It, It is a fun game but does not work at all. Game lags so much that it is unplayable and there are many graphics glitches.
's, game, great, It, It's a great game. Though there are some bugs with the clouds (a small cloud blocking an island with an item on it.)
is, game, basic, what, A bit pricy for what is a very basic and repetitive game with no real story. Just endlessly expand and defend islands by positioning various units around small maps. Very easy to pick up, very simple mechanics. It's a good game.

is, game, actual, This, This is an actual good game. It is a good strategy game that is a lot of fun. My only wish is that they add more to it. Maybe even let the player be the raiders in a different mode. It's still a lot of fun. I mainly enjoyed it cause i don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on it to win and no ads. If you hate this game than your bad at adjusting to different foes. I really like the late game when it gets more challenging. And again if any creators see this. Please add more. It ended so fast.

is, game, great, it, The only thing i dont like about this game is that it takes forever to load other than that it is a great game
is, game, awesome, this, Great game, and usually I do not like micro strategy games but this is an awesome game.
's, game, different, It, Very good until late game, when it becomes extremely frustrating. Partly because it was so good earlier, you expect it to keep being that. But once the big vikings show up, it stops making any sense: your guys just get going about all over the place and you have to react very fast, but it's so easy to select the wrong group. I found many of the late battles almost random - just repeat several times until you get through, without it being exactly clear why. It's a different, frustrating game.

's, game, good, It, It's a good game, but like others, it tends to get stuck on the loading screen.
is, game, really, This, This is a really, really fun strategy game. I love the way it simplifies the RTS-style game play so it is more accessible for mobile. The only problem I have encountered is the extremely high battery consumption (a little over 20% per hour). If they can fix that with a low power setting this will be very worthy of five stars!

's, scam, complete, It, Fix your game devs! DO NOT BUY THIS. The game is totally broken and they haven't replied to the email I sent for a refund. Google really shouldn't be allowing this game in the Play Store in this state. The game doesn't save, it doesn't keep unlocks and it gets stuck generating islands. Great gameplay let down by being a totally broken game. It's a complete scam that this has been a problem from launch, it's not been fixed and the devs do not reply. The 5* reviews surely cannot be real.
is, bucks, best, This, This is by far the best $5 bucks I ever spent on a mobile game I love everything about it the simplicity with a twist. Great game 10 stars
's, fit, perfect, it, Excellent streamlined RTS. I first discovered this gen on Xbox Game Pass, and I had to buy the mobile edition because it's such a perfect fit.
was, game, cool, It, It was really a cool game, I passed on easy! Challenging to me on normal but one request to the devs, please, please make a new game+ option.
is, example, perfect, this, I'm absolutely in love, small unit leadership is something I'm familiar with and this is a perfect example of it
was, game, crafted, this, I just finished the game on easy and dispite some annoying bugs, I have to say this was a beautifully crafted strategy game that does not disappoint. Well worth the price. I'm definitely playing through again on all the difficulty settings.
are, instructions, many, their, Great game! Haven't had any issues on my moto phone. I think the tutorial really helps you understand the gameplay, even if their aren't many instructions. This is possibly one of my favorite strategy games! Thanks!
is, RTS, good, This, This is a really good RTS if you are more into puzzles than stressful RTS. There are some roguelike elements as well, but you can turn them off if you like. But the game itself is really good, the way you need to match troops against certain foes, and also positioning them correctly. And as you progress in the game, that becomes more and more important and more difficult to pull off.
's, game, great, it, Everytime I get far it doesn't save my game and I don't wanna keep starting a new one. Too bad cuz it's a great game.
being, game, paid, This, Absolutely love the game. But the game is stuck at loading screen after I reached 50% in a campaign run. This being a paid game, this loading issue is a huge dealbreaker.
be, assets, difficult, it, Need more content only 3 classes with three levels pretty ordinary for a payed game need more specialized units why can't we have giants or javelin throwers or dual welders ,axe men throwing axe men it wouldn't be difficult assets are already in game would make replayable Or weapon specializations archer to crossbow Or pikemen to with sheild or more armour Soo many things I stop playing after the second checkpoint got too boring playing on hard aswell
is, example, great, This, Fantastic real-time tactical battle game. This is a great example of simplicity masking depth.
's, game, good, It, It's a pretty good game for passing the time Decent challenge and has some replay value as well. My only complaint is it doesnt always save my progress when I exit. Luckily im only losing minutes not hours of gameplay.
's, üëå, perfect, It, It's perfect üëå , but it is short üòë
be, fun, much, this, i think this kind a game should add sandbox mode so you can make your own island, wave, and you can share the levels with other people. please make this sandbox this will be so much fun to play not just boring
's, game, brilliant, It, It Won't Save Any More! It's an brilliant little game, love it but I haven't been able to save recently which has become extremely annoying. Normally I would give 5 stars but this needs to be addressed so till then it sit at 1

's, game, great, it, No matter what from I've seen it's a great game but when just got it I tried to start a new campaign but every time I did it crashed on me sadly
'm, fan, huge, I, I'm a huge Total War fan and I was skeptical at first from looking at it but this is a phenomenal game that stands out on its own and has really fun strategy aspects unlike most other games out there.
is, game, phenomenal, this, I'm a huge Total War fan and I was skeptical at first from looking at it but this is a phenomenal game that stands out on its own and has really fun strategy aspects unlike most other games out there.
's, game, bad, It, It's not a bad game but it gets quite repetitive. Also I get it that it's a game and a fictionalised universe, but I thought we moved on from the (mis)representation of Vikings as bloodthirsty brutes.
is, game, great, It, It doesn't save! This problem has apparently been going on for almost a year. Fix this problem! It is a great game but very frustrating! Edit: Just did a new campaign to see if it saves. When I exit and come back in, I have to start a new campaign??? What a shame
's, price, more, It, This is one of the best strategy games I've found. The gameplay is enjoyable, the art is fantastic, if you screw up, your game is basically over... Like you have to restart... decisions are critical, you pay dearly for screw ups, though it's not so bad that by other good decisions you can't recover. There is a ton of variety, so you can play through again with completely different results. It's awesome, more than worth the price.
's, game, nice, It, It's a nice game!
's, concept, neat, It, I made the mistake of not looking at the gameplay before making my purchase. I was under the impression you were the vikings. It's still a neat concept. However a version where you play the Vikings landing on European islands would be awesome.
'm, player, recent, I, Really want to give this 4 or maybe 5, but it's too buggy. It can take a long time for the game to become responsive when starting up again, I've waited several minutes for it to generate maps and let me play again, to no avail. Edit, I'm a recent player, the game has been updated, but the bugs remain. Starting to wonder if positive reviews are for other platforms or paid.
's, challenge, real, it, Can't praise this game highly enough. Coming off the back of my first completion (medium difficult) absolutely buzzing because I won with 5 troops left. Controls are perfect, AI is mind-blowing, customisation of army is spot on, graphics are clean, it's a real challenge (I haven't even tried hard yet) but very rewarding, no in-app purchases or adverts - which ironically makes me want to throw money at the devs. 10/10, also made in Unity which is the dankest game engine.

'm, days, few, I, Absolutely awesome game! I played this game for a few weeks on Xbox One and enjoyed it. When I saw it in the Play Store, I absolutely had to have it. I'm a few days in and still loving it!
is, wich, amazing, This, This is an amazing game wich there is none other like. But I would say that they should ad were if you hold in the unit (pikemen and swordsmen)where you can do formations such as the phalanx. And should add more modes for example. A creative mode where you can make your own island or defend agaisnt zombies or where you are the Vikings and you attack. They should also add PvP wich would be so fun. Anyway it's a good game and its worth the five bucks. Good luck

'm, one, only, I, A great little game with lovely graphics and pitch perfect level of difficulty, treading the line well between being too punishing and too easy. I'd easily give the game 4 or even 5 stars but I've just encountered the save file bug that means I've just lost my progress about halfway through the campaign. For me, the loading screen gets stuck whilst "generating islands". Looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this issue and it's a shame as it's a blight on an otherwise we'll made game.
is, game, thought, It, It is a very well thought out game. I'm still enjoying the gameplay as well. However I don't know if it is my personal account that is linked with the game or the game itself but it doesn't save my progress. Everytime I go back on to the game I have to create my lords and start again.

is, game, interesting, This, This is an interesting game.
is, game, fun, This, Updated my review because it seems the save issue isnt a problem anymore. This is a fun and challenging game
is, game, stunning, It, It is a stunning game to look at. The gameplay is smooth and although not easy to master it makes it all the more fun to master. The game itself revs up quickly so the simplicity of it makes it all the more interesting the further you go. The replayability is high, and as such is recommended for any would be general.
is, game, good, It, It is good game but 5$ is lot for around 5 hrs and after 2hrs you have everything unlock I played it on normal difficulty and it was chill I think nightmare difficulty woud be almost impossible soo this game is good chalange and if you re casual player try another games this isn't worth of your money but still good game and deep fight tactics but usually you will beat almost every enemy with spear and
is, platform, perfect, this, Can't recommended this enough! And this is the perfect platform for this game!
's, game, fun, It, It's a very fun game that gets more challenging as you progress. Strategically planning the types of troops you're going to upgrade to combat the invading enemies and laying out a plan are important keys to winning a campaign. Game has high replay value. I would like to see more classes in the future such as support healers or super infantry would be cool.
is, gem, rare, This, Fun, strategic, and challenging. This is a rare gem.
's, time, real, it, Great mobile RTS. It's no TD and that's good! I like that each unit feels unique, can evolve and may die, permanently. The auto-slomo while a unit is selected is a great idea. As is the constant progression of the vikings on the main map, generating a sense of overall strategy. Yet it's still mainly real-time and tactical, and I tend more and more towards turn-based strategy, so...
is, example, perfect, This, This is the perfect example of what mobile gaming should be! Great game, no issues, simple yet challenging!
is, game, good, It, It is a very good game, the only con is the loading time.
's, time, great, it, Honestly this app is worth the money and it's a great time waster You can feel like you're conquering epic villages or defending something feel like your own personal fantasy Good game
's, game, good, It, It's a good game so much fun! Don't get it if you want try it, it wont let you refund your money my friend did not like it idk why.ü§î

is, game, best, This, This is the best RTS game I've found on mobile. Totally recommend it. The game works great on my galaxy S9.
is, one, crappy, which, Won't load anymore on my Samsung Tablet which isn't a crappy one. Use to work great ,but now it won't load my saved game. Please fix‚òπ
is, game, fantastic, This, This is a fantastic and simple game! ...Well starts simple and gets increasingly difficult. I grabbed this on the PC a few months ago, this is identical! Awesome game üëç
is, game, great, This, This is a great game! I first tried it on PC, and when I saw it on Android I thought "what a perfect fit". It's a form of lite RTS with hero elements, perfect for bite-sized dip-ins, with really pleasing art and interface and a nice subtle soundscape. The only minor quibble is limited replayability, but it's totally worth it even for one campaign. I encountered no stability or save issues on a Galaxy Note 10, so maybe those reported previously have been fixed?
's, game, full, it, Cool game! Love the fact it's a full game without buying additional items. And love the sounds and visuals.
is, game, good, this, After getting over some initial install issues this is a very good strategy game, but having played it for 30 mins I now have loading issues again so uninstalled.
's, game, good, It, It's a really good game. It's clever as the game play is set up in such a way that your tactics have to and do continue to develop and improve as you move through the difficulty level. From normal to hard to very hard. Also as it paid for there are no ads or extras to pay for or upgrade timers.
