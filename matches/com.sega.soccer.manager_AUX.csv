's, sailing, smooth, it, Had some issues starting a new game but it's been resolved. Going to start play soon and see if it's smooth sailing from here.
is, state, current, this, One Step Forward, Three Steps Back The new features are good, however the overall experience has been a hot mess. Performance issues where none used to exist with prior FMMs, a bold, if not harsh, UI color scheme, and my frustrations that the app still can't fill to screen highlight my overall dissatisfactions at this point with the app. As someone who sinks both dollars and hours into this game yearly, it just feels frustrating that this is the current "final state".

's, idea, good, it, First it have me options of an in game editor or rich chairman. It wouldn't connect to purchase them. Thought it's probably a good idea not to get involved with that so onto the next page. Couldn't even get the first name and last name. I would click the box, I get the prompt to your my name which I did. Then it still asked me for first name. Also with the second. Cannot get any further now so I've refunded it.
is, issue, known, this, I'm giving this game 1 star atm because I have literally just purchased the game & started my career to find that I have ¬£0 money to spend on transfers for a Premier league team. I don't know if this is a known issue or its supposed to be that way but half of the fun of the game is to buy players & I can't.
's, same, exact, it, love the game but it's the exact same as last year
are, colour, similiar, they, Not impressed with the game play, wen 2-0 up at h/t most times u end up drawing 2-2 or losing 3-2 and nearly every game conceding in 90th min, I'm impressed with the work done on transfers, something needs to be done about the greens on player positions as they are too similiar colour, the colours need to be more defined like last year's version
is, version, first, this, I love football manager games and I buy the latest one every year. I always have a Samsung phone and it works really well. My son has a Motorola phone and this is the first version he has ever tried to play and it does not work. The layout is weird, you cannot see a lot of the screen and therefore can't access certain parts of the game! Can this be fixed? He is a footy mad 11 year old who wants to play the game I love so much! Thanks üëç

's, way, best, it, Please Sega can you add more countries trainable especially in Europe like " Moldova , Kazakhstan Iceland , Romania etc.. " and Asian countries " Syria , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Australia , Japan " The experience is very incomplete alot of people would like to train their countries or start with small countries . I will rise my feedback to 5 if any update come out for this. Thanks " Update " i have refund the game it's the best way to show the company that you don't like the way they are behaving
was, version, best, It, Basic......dont like it. I can't believe the is no FM22 Touch version. It was by far the best version for Tablets. Will it make a comeback?
's, üò§, frustrating, that, we still have issues of players that don't get approached even when they've been transfer listen for the whole season....that's very frustrating üò§
was, time, first, I, I like the game, and the gameplay. I haven't encountered too many bugs, but one that is really frustrating me is I'm unable to sign into google play games with the game? I was the first time I played now ever since I can't. I've tried reinstalling, clearing the cache of the google play services/games apps and no success. I've also tried to report the issue via the ingame report and the game crashes. But yeah other that I'm enjoying the game.
is, thing, good, which, Enjoying the game not been easy so far which is a good thing. Only minor complaint is not having any sound in game background music or sound effects during matches would be cool.
's, game, unfinished, it, Half the time the graphics work half the time it's like I'm playing it on a Nokia brick, if it's an unfinished game just DONT RELEASE IT
's, waste, absolute, it, Have bought FM Mobile for years and never had an issue until 2022. Game doesn't cover the full screen so it's all small and awkward to press on next button etc. How do you get a refund because it's an absolute waste of money! Just downloaded it today but would not recommend at all! Wouldn't waste your money such a shame
's, game, good, it, it's a very good game with amazing details. played last year's game and have to say they've made another great game with new additions. would recommend this game to everyone. it's always a very good price not expensive like most other games

's, game, good, It, It's a good game when it works but that's the thing it doesn't actually work crashes very time I get to half time in a match disappointing to see and I hope it is fixed soon
's, game, java, It, Please team FM is there a solution of increasing the display to full screen? I am using a Samsung A22 and I am not getting full screen display rather a center cut display? Can it be fixed? The app is not just functioning. I don't know if it's because of the resolution size or whether it is not compatible with Samsung A22. I can't even access the home menu. It's a java game on an android.
's, screen, uninstslled, it, Wish I hadn't bothered, one minute it's half a screen, uninstslled and tried again, got a stretched screen. Waste of money
'm, fan, big, I, Dear developer. I bought every version of this game for a long time, I'm a big fan of FM since 2005! And always disappointed in FM Mobile. Why don't support the new screen ratio!? It's 2 years ago that I asked for this! The developer told me the new mobile screen ratio was hard to fix for support and I understand it. But after 2 years your game still does not support the new mobile screen ratio!? Really? Why does iPhone's new screen ratio has support but for Andriod phone doesn't? From a big fan of your game...till now.
is, game, only, This, Awful. Absolute rubbish. This is the only game I ever buy every year. Wish I hadn't bothered this year Game absolutely doesn't work on the Galaxy Note Ultra. Screen is awful stretched and unreadable in some places. Crashes every two to three games. Sometimes games end but you cant progress meaning a restart is needed and the game needs playing again. Awful, dreadful. DO NOT BUY IT!!
is, time, first, This, More than willing to change my review as I get Football Manager every year and every year I love it and literally get hundreds of hours out of it. This is the first time I've ever had problems, once I select which nations I want to play in, it's just stuck in "Initializing Game" and just doesn't progress, was stuck on that screen for about 20 minutes. Really gutted as I was really looking forward to this edition and the new features, hopefully this can get resolved.
's, game, good, It, It's a good game but I see no change from the last football manager game football manager 2021
is, time, first, This, This is the first time in over 6/7 games I can say that the game is not worth the money. I would normally buy the in game pack too but not this time. The natural screen is tiny and when you then click to stretch it via user interface it looks horrible. Previous games didn't have this issue so why change it? To be honest it actually spoils what could have been a really good game. The developers should be ashamed of FM22MOBILE its an absolute disgrace a company so experienced in making this game.

's, üò≥, tiny, it, Screen stretch needs Fixinh ASAP was fine last night and now turned into a layout from 2003 you take screen stretch off and it's tiny üò≥
's, screen, full, It, It's not full screen. Pls fix it!!!
's, buggy, kinda, it, The game isn't bad it doesn't full screen on my phone and it's kinda annoying I'm on the Samsung s20 Fe. The game is basically the same as last year I would like to see more added but oh well. I buy this for on the go and play the PC version when I'm at home. 3 star till game gets fixed cause it's kinda buggy.
'm, reviewer, second, I, I'm the second reviewer
