Comes, with, bunch, Excellent emulator. Comes with a bunch of features, works well, and is highly customizable.
pay, for, it, While is it unfortunate that you have to pay for it, it is the best DS emulator for android money can buy. Heavily customizable in every setting possible and runs at a very consistent framerate. If I could rate 4.9 stars I would because me likey dark mode and there's no dark mode feature.

download, as, alternative, Literally just drastic but with a different menu design even the files are named the same when ya download it great as a cheap alternative although if you are gonna steal someone else's creation at least try hard to hide it.
crash, in, areas, I was playing "final fantasy tactics adv 2" and the game would crash in certain areas and when loading in multiple hit spells. It is a bit clunky but overall quite cheap. I switched to a $5.00 paid version with identical user interface but 5-star for smoothness and 5-star for rendering spells happier with my new experience but definitely used this alot until I found it. Don't settle, there are better emulators out there!

fill, with, Nostalgia, I don't usually rate apps anymore but this is legitimately the only good DS emulator on the app store. If you want something that runs good to fill you with Nostalgia this is the emulator you want. Might seem glitchy at times but you just have to go to the settings to fix it and if you're confused they have a help button! (:

save, for, game, Great emulator, brings me so much nostalgia playing games I used to play years ago and I love finally playing those I never got to play back then! :) I really love how you can save screen layouts for every game individually. To the people having problems with the app after it working just fine and then trying to boot up a game again: For me it works going to App info > Storage > Clear Cache (don't worry, it won't affect any of your save data). Maybe it helps someone here.

using, with, ads, This is the one. I tried using others and others with ads and they failed me. My wired controller works great for the vDS emulator. Worth the 99c.

relive, to, app, Runs better than expected. I was expectant to want a refund as the last 3 emulators proved useless to me and would not run my roms. However, not only does Mario run well, I have actually been able to relive my nintendogs nostalgia thanks to this app. Five stars.
ds, with, crashes, Its so close to ds with minimal crashes.

use, for, emulator, As someone that is pretty skeptical about trying new games (especially ones that I have to pay for), I wasn't sure about which app to use for an emulator. I finally decided on this one after doing some research and am pleasantly surprised by the good quality and ease of use. I would recommend adjusting the on screen controls a bit to fit your comfort. But I have no complaints. 10/10

run, on, systems, Its a DIRECT RIPOFF of Drastic, and just like drastic it doesn't run on android 11 systems so yet another waste of cash at this point im just going to buy the cartridge and play it on my DS rather than a EMU

HOPING, for, multiplayer, There's No multiplayer, and I was HOPING for multiplayer so i could play with my phone and my DSi on Kirby Super Star Ultra. I REALLY dislike that that the developers haven't added multiplayer (and they probably won't, either based on how they said it.) if you like playing DS games without friends or multiplayer this is a good emulator. It doesn't lag much or crash much on newer Android devices. Thank you for reading! ❤️😊

beat, for, u, Just love it its better then the drastic i say and for a 1dollar u cant beat tht
using, for, this, Litterly just Drastic DS clone, so if it runs well, I'm not sure, thanks to some issues, can't even play the games I have on my External SD card anymore, until this is fixed, 1 star, an emulator that can't play games from external is just a fancy icon to me, not even using internal storage for this... And other emulators use external so I know my SD card works
recommend, to, others, Recent user of this app and man do I love it. Plays all my NDS games very well, especially Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and Mario Kart DS. I'd definitely recommend it to others.
link, to, one, Tells me I need a NDS bios but gives me absolutely no option to link to one, garbage emulator and refunded
do, to, you, What did Drastic do to you ???😂😂😂😂😂😂 You literally just copied and pasted the firmware and changed the logo!!!!!! This is all sorts of sad and hilarious!💯😂
look, in, files, Its runs flawlesly but its a complete rip off of drastic it even says drastic if you look in the files pls go support the original creator
playing, on, phone, I have just had such an experience like playing real nintendo ds games on my andriod phone using this app. If... if you are reading my comment, I'm so happy when you fufil my suggestion. It is the one what we need and what we really stick into that is the local wifi function which is needed to be added in your app like it works in My boy emulator. Thank you for the app. It is so valuable a lot only with a dollar.

tried, on, store, Emulates with default settings better than any other emulation app that I've tried on the store. Only gripe is lowering the volume doesn't really work well. 100% is really loud and 10% is slightly less loud. Kind of annoying.
worry, about, issues, Money well spent! I can enjoy all my favorite games and classics and not have to worry about lag or crash issues. For being only $1, this is an excellent nds emulator.
had, with, states, I was relatively happy with the app, and it has a lot of cool features. Unfortunately it's had reoccurring issues with save states. Recently, all the save states managed to get deleted - even the Google drive ones. Only savestates were affected, not layout options or settings, but it's a pretty major problem.
classified, as, scam, I want a refund. Is this not classified as a scam? I already have drastic and just wanted to try out other options to see how they are like but this is just a copy of drastic. Whats the point of giving your money to a lazy scam artist instead of the real developers. At that point you can just get it for free and that's already better for everyone.

Spent, for, one, Downloaded the majority of the free emulators to find they all had painful quirks. Spent the dollar for this one and so far so good.
installed, in, phone, This was literally Drastic DS emulator underneath. I have drastic installed in my phone and when I opened this, the saves actually loaded from the same folder. Refunded immediately after purchase.

experienced, with, emulators, Look, I experienced frame rate issues with other emulators but not this one and generally easy to use. If you had a ds younger and it broke and you want to play your old ds games without spending 300$ this is a good option.
work, on, application, I've purchased the app. However, all my favorite games from my previous physical NDS has .sav file. the only file extension this vDS can only support is .dsv. Can you make a way on how to support the .sav file? naming file extension to vice versa won't work on the application. Make it and I will give you 5 Stars. Thanks!
provide, to, anything, I have one major problem... I just don't know where to get the games at, and they don't make it very clear or even provide a link to anything. Also I looked up stuff on youtube and google to find answers but it's always just a download link to a malware. If you could provide literally anything explaining how to SAFELY download the actual games it would be very helpful.
worked, for, couple, The app won't stop crashing... I'm disappointed because it worked super well for a couple of days and now I just can't open anything without it crashing, and considering this is a payed app I feel a bit cheated....
decided, within, minutes, This is a good emulator, but only one problem i got when i play every ds game... The L button automatically touched everytime i press the other buttons... And that was annoying, interupting the gameplay..so, within a few minutes i decided ti refunding it.
use, as, ABXY, AMAZING APP, only reason that I didn't give it 5 star was I would like a way to use the Right stick (R3) as ABXY as in games like cod black opps you use that to move
looking, like, kid, Now I can play ds games without looking like that kid in highschool you always wanted to punch in the face!
looking, in, highschool, Now I can play ds games without looking like that kid in highschool you always wanted to punch in the face!
play, from, childhood, This a truly great DS emulator, and for such a cheap price too! I love how all of the cheats are at your disposal from the get go. I've used this emulator to play several games from my childhood, and it hasn't crashed once! If you want a great DS emulator, buy this one!
play, on, phone, Really cool and can play on latest phone rather than drastic with no update. Also i may add suggestion to at least allow the ds to trade or battle in pokemon with other user. Overall its still cool but i just hope you will uodate and allow it to support multiplayer. Well, Thank You for an awesome app.

works, with, game, Solid emulator works well with every game I play on it and the pre ready cheats aren't bad but aren't always helpful I have a decent frame rate over using drastic so I highly recommend

hunt, to, games, Works great. No problems as far as I can tell... just have to hunt down a site to download games and your all set
look, for, codes, It's actually pretty good, many emulators I have to look for the codes online and input them individually. I've only played pokemon black but the codes were already some how preloaded. No need to search the web and input/name them yourself.
bought, on, whim, I bought this on a whim as most of the DS emulators lag or are bad. But I was happy that this works perfectly
say, to, mom, Pokemon crash can't even say goodbye to my mom was working well but kept crashing
care, about, Emulation, I'm going to be honest, the app runs flawlessly. Haven't had a crash whatsoever from when I first bought it. Why am I rating 1 star even though it works flawlessly? This is thanks to the fact that it is a shameless copy of DraStic, plagiarised through and through. Even the directory says DraStic. If you care about DS Emulation, you'll support the original developers instead. I had only come to the realisation that it was a shameless copy after buying it.

speed, in, way, Great emulator, works well with or without cheats. NO ADS, overall Great value. One con u can't speed up the in any way. Otherwise its amazing.
catching, on, games, Great for catching up on handheld games
stay, to, it, So, the app does stay true to it's words though, this is a reskin of the more well known, DraStic - DS Emulator. Even the file directory tells you so. Now, I would say this could be a good deal if you wanted the plagarized, cheaper version of an outdated DraStic, you are more than welcome to do so. You may get the same experience as you do for DraStic depending on your hardware. But, if you want software updates and less likely to experience crashes. I would highly recommend DraStic.

work, for, emulator, Can't seem to get any games to work for this emulator and now i kinda wanna return it back. If yall can help improve this then id keep it
comes, with, cheats, Works great, some games comes with cheats
gave, to, you, I own this because it looks cooler than drastic but homie u just stole drastic and then re colored it U really don't deserve the money even though I kida gave it to you.
look, at, storage, Dude, look at your internal storage and you could find a drastic folder on it. Why? Because this is a drastic emulator, skinned version perhaps. Anyways... Thank yoyu.

Works, like, dime, The best emulator ever! Works like a dime
hiccups, like, other, For 99 cents?! Insane value! You'll get your normal emulator hiccups just like any other, but if you know what to expect, this will give you years of entertainment value for basically free. Zero lag even with the speed boost. The app DOES crash very rarely so be sure to keep your save state updated and your hard save as well. If you don't have a DS emulator already, just get this one.
worked, for, while, It worked for a good while then just randomly started crashing my game would stop working well it was just 99€ I just wanna play my animal crossing wild world game on a emulator that wont crash that is all I want cause I dont have a ds or anything like that dont have the money to get one so I just want a emulator that wont crash so I can play my game all my hard work on my animal crossing is gome cause it will start to crash when it says Nintendo and then starts to play the song my game plays

play, for, database, This is literally Drastic emulator with a different name. Legitimately exact same set up, same load up, same play out for the cheat database. Even worse, it has the same limitations on games it can run, just like Drastic does.
loaded, with, ads, I don't think it's an understatement to say this is the best ds emulator on the play store. All the others are either loaded with ads, laggy, or more commonly, both. This emulator runs games perfectly for just a dollar, with no ads whatsoever. Definitely worth it.

ask, for, refund, After starting the emulator, my mobile can make calls but the voice/sound function is muted. I have restart my mobile to get my mobile to work. Please fix this or else i will ask for a refund.
went, into, files, I cannot get this to work. I downloaded a Rhythm heaven file, and I went into my files, and it's not there. I can't run it. Someone help?
use, without, codes, This emulator is the best You can use cheats without codes (you can add it your own too) (even tho I never use the cheats :P) And it's only $1 really cheap There's no lag when you play the game And you can make shortcuts Really worth it
Reccomended, for, people, The best emulator I got Why? 1.Because it's Cheap 2.No lag 3.You can make shortcuts for the games 4.The cheat is available (you can add your own cheat code too) Reccomended for people who doesn't have a ds
stressed, from, day, The only thing that calms me down when I am stressed from a hard day at school.
recommend, to, people, Great, better than the free knock off version's out there would really recommend this app to people
pay, for, app, First of all this application is stolen because this is a drastic emulator copy and paste, the ui is the same, controls and settings, practically everything is different except the startup menu is changed just to cover-up that they don't own this code that they "made". But the fortunate thing about this emulator that it partially works and is much more cheaper then the drastic emulator itself, so it depends for the consumer to decide, to pay for a cheaper app or a more expensive app.
have, on, problem, I gotta say, this emulator is by far my favorite , i just have on question/ problem, but is there a way to carry save data over, like if i got a new phone, and got the app again would i be able to resume right where i left off on pokemon on my old phone

left, on, app, It suck's Badd because when you exit the app when you Go Back in the app it won't let you click continue. Well also Won't Let you continue where you left off on the app because you had to go through everything all over Again.

staying, with, this, Best ever staying with this forever
comes, with, cheats, Works perfectly, comes with cheats on it already, just needs wifi and it'd be even better. I'm on a Note 20 Ultra and I get no lag, one game bugged out but that was a rom issue, not emulator issues.
play, in, mode, Doesn't play in portrait mode.
saved, on, emulator, It works great. But rarely it deletes save states even after i saved on the emulator and in game.
use, with, games, Runs games well, clean system set up, over all performance is good, easy to use, and has some prebuilt codes to use with games if you feel like it. Honestly it is worth what I paid for it and I wouldn't think twice about reccomending it to others.

get, for, wiimmfi, Runs really well on my device. I have no real issues against it except it doesn't have multiplayer and wifi support. If we could get an update with those in the future for wiimmfi this emulator would easily be 10/10. Look at how melon DS implemented wifi emulation if you need to.
using, for, month, This honestly the best Emulator I've ever used and the ones I did were free and total garage but this one was only $0.99 so I was like okay let's try it it's cheap and not a lot like drastic and so I bought VDS and been using it for almost a month and I love it HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP
seem, for, price, Tried the free route for emulators and few of them were good. Drastic didn't seem all that good for the price so I decided to try out this for only a dollar. Seems amazing so far for being so cheap

slow, unlike, emulators, Best $1 I ever spent! It has a x2 speed button! <3 and does not slow down unlike other emulators!

needed, for, emulator, Everything needed for a good emulator. I recommend for the pro and the rookie alike.

played, through, HeartGold, This should be rated 5 by all. Great emulator, played through both Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver with no issues. You can customise layout, and ffw gameplay at the boring bits. Excellent app, thanks devs!

get, on, version, No controller support and doesnt play most of my ds games you can get better on a free version
saving, for, time, Its been saving my pokemon black records for quite some time and then boom it crashes and records were gone.
upload, to, Drive, I was kind of scared at the beginning, but the app continued to amaze me. Savefile upload to Drive, great performance on Pokemon Platinum, no ads, clear interface, everything for just 0,99$. Great work guys!
play, with, friends, Its really good Is there a way that you can play with friends on it Love to battle online on pokemon Heartgold

makes, for, experience, Didn't work and bad interface makes for a overall not good playing experience 😕
playing, on, emu, I do love playing mario on this emu
total, After, hours, The fast forward function works better than any other emulator I've tried. After about 8 hours of use total no crashes, no ads, and no problems. Can't beat the value here.
recommend, for, price, I was weary bc the price sounded too good to be true but it works really well!! I play sonic games on this mofo and I cant wait to experience the catalog the DS has but the only thing I dislike is that sometimes every now and then the load and save states dont work that well but other than that I recommend it for the price
waiting, for, download, Its said "waiting for download" 15 min now Edit: Still waiting. 4GB of extra room
get, For, $, This app is awesome! For 1$ you get a ds emulator with lots of settings to get games running just as tou want on your device. Id definitely recommend this. Been using it to play dragon quest at a way higher resolution than it was made for and it feels like I'm playing a Playstation 2 game with all the graphical tweaks I've made! It has great Bluetooth support by the way

made, unlike, emulators, Only got the app very recently, and I was a tad anxious due to the lack of reviews, but so far the app has been working very well. A lack of ads, a number of preset cheat codes you can easily turn on or off, and a simple/reliable setup for choosing a game (and actually playing it) makes this a worthy buy. All of this for only a dollar too, simply wonderful. Plus, unlike the other emulators, it is actually made for the current version of Android.
