beaten, on, phone, Thanks for fixing the crashing bug. I had already beaten the game on another phone I have, and this game was amazing! Although I didn't really like how on Hard Boiled Mode, or normal mode, there's a chance that Birthday Boy Blam and Grunkfuss can enter the hallway at the exact same time, making it almost impossible, especially on HBM, to get rid of BBB. This can also happen with Eyesaur, but hes beatable because he doesnt attack as fast. Beside that, excellent game and port!

go, to, tabs, Awesome game! I love the mechanics and it's super easy to move around and check cams quickly. I haven't experienced the bug people yet where you get frozen at some point. Although if I go to recent tabs and go back in I get serious lag. Other than that, great game and really not a disappointing third entry to the series! Keep up the good work, guys!

play, on, mobile, Everyone to play this on mobile you need to have 2 GB of storage to load the game and play it. Also its scary.
get, to, screen, As of now, the game can't even get to the warning screen without crashing. I know this is already being fixed, but next time can you please test this on smaller devices so we don't get deceived from these crashes. (Update: the game works perfectly fine now. I works perfectly and the 2nd half of the game is so intense. Definitely give this a try.)
